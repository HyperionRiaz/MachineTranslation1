Resumption of the session
Please rise , then , for this minute ' s silence .
( The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence )
Madam President , on a point of order .
If the House agrees , I shall do as Mr Evans has suggested .
Madam President , on a point of order .
I would like your advice about Rule 143 concerning inadmissibility .
It says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability .
This is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld .
Thank you , Mr Segni , I shall do so gladly .
Indeed , it is quite in keeping with the positions this House has always adopted .
It is the case of Alexander Nikitin .
But , Madam President , my personal request has not been met .
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well .
It will , I hope , be examined in a positive light .
Why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998 ?
Why are there no fire instructions ?
Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident ?
Why are no-smoking areas not enforced ?
It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves .
I would ask that they reconsider , since this is not the case .
Mr Berenguer Fuster , we shall check all this .
I admit that , at present , the matter seems to be somewhat confused .
We shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be .
It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo .
As people have said , the situation there is extremely volatile .
There is , in fact , a risk of a military coup in the future .
We do not know what is happening .
So why should EU arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people ?
No amendments have been proposed relating to Monday and Tuesday .
Relating to Wednesday :
Then we shall follow the usual procedure , hearing one speaker in favour and one against .
According to its President , it is in a position to do so .
( Applause from the PSE Group )
We therefore respect whatever Parliament may decide .
( Parliament rejected the request ) President .
The PPE-DE Group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda .
Is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this ?
Decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind .
That is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda .
Thank you , Mr Poettering .
We shall now hear Mr Wurtz speaking against this request .
Madam President , I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering ' s lack of logic .
It is not a lot to ask .
( Parliament rejected the request , with 164 votes for , 166 votes against and 7 abstentions )
My vote was " in favour " .
Madam President , the Presidency has already declared the result of the vote .
There is no room for amendments .
That did not happen .
This is an important matter .
You did not call me either .
Even so , I think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the Minutes .
This seems to me to be a workable solution .
Of course , the Minutes for tomorrow ' s sitting will take into account any additional explanations .
Mr Cox , Mr Hänsch , would this be acceptable to you ?
We shall pay particular attention to the wording of the Minutes , as we always do , of course .
If they do not properly reflect the positions adopted , then we may correct them , if necessary .
( The order of business was adopted thus amended )
Safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods
All of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed .
Our amendments from the first reading have , I believe , been taken into account very satisfactorily .
I would urge you to endorse this .
In fact , all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province .
All the same , we must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety .
I congratulate him on his excellent report .
When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety .
We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved .
Madam President , I would like to make a few comments .
We are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also , in fact , with minimum requirements .
This is a pity , in a sense .
In short , the issue is an important one .
The work is done . All that remains is the business of enforcement .
I would like to mention one final point .
This gives them a competitive edge for the interim period .
Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements .
This , however , does not seem feasible .
I should like to make just a few comments .
My second point has already been mentioned : it concerns the minimum standards .
My third point has also been mentioned already .
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur , Mr Koch .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Transport of dangerous goods by road
I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job .
In addition , the need for greater transparency has been pointed out .
My amendments concern the frost-resistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods .
There is support for the EU in Lapland also , so let us remember them .
I have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to -40ºC .
This would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously .
I hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow ' s vote .
I thought that it was quite superb .
This directive is a contribution to this .
What we are doing today is essentially a nuisance .
Most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature .
This makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind .
In area after area , we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the Member States .
This is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned .
In many ways , the prerequisites differ from one Member State to another .
It is good that , in establishing the present regulations , we can also be flexible .
I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment .
We therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Structural Funds - Cohesion Fund coordination
We have seen poverty growing in Wales ; and growing still further since 1997 .
We have seen the gap between rich and poor widen .
We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to additionality .
We look to the Commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects .
Too much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transparent .
This is one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales .
Poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood .
In the past , this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment .
The consequences do not inspire hope .
This lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs .
Agriculture only provides 5.5 % of employment in the Union .
I think that this work has been carried out extremely well .
Small and medium-sized businesses , above all , need to take part in the distribution of these funds .
It was because of the discredited policies of his own Conservative Party .
I suggest Mr Evans goes back and reads the regulation .
My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today .
I want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines .
It is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi-tech sector .
They should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape .
We are badly behind now in this matter .
It is especially important to get SMEs involved in the planning and implementation of programmes .
Projects have to be carried out more efficiently , more flexibly and they have to be made more productive .
This report is very good and our Group supports it .
We feel that the Funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion .
We might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator .
Some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population .
This fact means that the European Parliament , the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisively and strategically .
I do not think , however , that this report has come too late .
This is what we are today asking the Commissioner for .
This latter point is of particular importance .
We do not want to build a Europe of cities alone .
I am raising the issue just to reiterate Parliament ' s position .
Personally , I at least am totally in favour of the guidelines .
Therefore , the Commission should address the issue once and for all .
Subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking .
As you know , it is up to each State to redistribute part of the total appropriation .
Europe should not be completely absent , as the states tend to want .
I think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear .
Well , the Structural Funds have helped to apply a brake to this process .
Its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds .
The report put forward today re-establishes its place in the political sphere .
It is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development .
This is what persuades us to vote in favour of it .
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work .
I would like to explain our thinking here .
Firstly , we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds .
Finally , we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed .
I urge the House to support these changes .
Regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States .
We still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the Union ' s fundamental objectives .
Nonetheless , their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities .
They are growing , but only in terms of GDP .
This is the purpose of these guidelines .
We must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work .
So that is the first priority , the competitiveness of regional economies .
It is true that consultation with Parliament has only come about at a late date .
This claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring ' s negotiations .
I actually quoted the text itself , in quotation marks .
I find the opposite the case .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Social and economic situation and development of the regions of the Union
The European Commission ' s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions .
It is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation .
This , Commissioner , is the first commandment for the coming period .
The report shows that growth has been uneven , despite all our efforts .
Very rapid growth is continuing in Central Europe .
This has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced .
For example , uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration .
Our Group is in favour of adopting this report .
They are supported by appropriate European Union structural fund activities .
Concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand-orientated economic policy is not the answer .
The situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions .
Mr President , my compliments to the rapporteur for his in-depth report .
Some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid is therefore called for .
It is , after all , they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit .
Surely this must be the ultimate goal .
Finally , I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European countries .
What is the result ?
This is very costly and it also causes very great social problems .
We must give them this opportunity .
This is a moral obligation the EU and all of us have .
The solution , as I see it , lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship .
What is a fair society ?
The most remote regions , still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rates , offer one example of this .
In Reunion , for example , the rate is 37 % .
It only remains to put this principle into practice .
I therefore appeal formally to the Council and the Commission .
So much for the quality .
Mr Fruteau stated just now that the fruits of growth were distributed inequitably .
You will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike .
I agree with your analysis .
I should like to mention a few specific points .
Mr Berend , you expressed a wish that zoning should be implemented quickly .
Well , we are coming to an end of the zoning phase .
This is my first point regarding the policy .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
( The sitting was closed at 8.25 p.m. )
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
I refer to item 11 on the order of business .
There is one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this .
That is something for which I have a deep appreciation .
It should not be dramatised into something more than that .
Thank you very much , Mr Cox .
I understand what you are saying .
We have taken note of this .
It therefore needs to be withdrawn from today 's agenda .
Mr Wynn , that makes sense .
The report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda .
This needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong .
Mrs Ahern , we have taken note of this .
We will also pass this on to our services , however .
Thank you very much .
( The Minutes were approved )
Reform of European competition policy
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
It is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the European competition policy .
It should continue along this path .
Only , without transparency there will be no acceptance , indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency .
Here too we should continue along the path we have chosen , strengthening and intensifying it .
This will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions .
Competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions .
But optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord .
Competition yes , restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible .
This being the case , let me now come to the proposals made in the report .
The Commission can only collate and analyse the data provided by the Member States .
Seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting .
The ECSC Treaty is due to expire shortly .
Under Article 88 , the Commission is obliged to supervise state aid .
Furthermore , the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid .
The rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996 .
There must be no watering-down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code .
No one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe .
A Council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the internal market is not complete .
Subsidies distort allocations , both within and between countries .
This applies to those which have been turned into monopolies , both private and public .
Public monopolies are , more often than not , phased out reluctantly .
Public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures .
Effective competition pushes prices down and raises standards of living .
It is precisely upon price levels that consumer policy has failed to focus sufficiently .
In fact , competition policy and consumer policy belong together .
The internal market is the basis for our work .
The EU ' s own regulations too may therefore need to be analysed .
In order to be effective , it must be well anchored in the Member States ' national authorities .
The law must be correctly applied in matters of competition .
We have a quite exciting debate in front of us .
All this is to the good of the consumer .
Dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs , at any rate .
The second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement .
But we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy .
One is subsidiarity .
Competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the European Union .
Here , a region has , by its own efforts , created a means of marketing its own products .
This own initiative must not be destroyed by European intervention .
I believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation .
Thank you very much , Mr Radwan .
A slim right-wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures .
The market favours the short term and immediate profits .
In order to function , the market needs rules .
The necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society .
We European Socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose .
The market is not an end in itself ; it must help to improve the human condition .
The Commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinders the internal market .
It would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid .
Human labour , on the other hand , is considered to be a simple factor in the equation .
We Socialists reject the liberals ' naïve optimism on this point .
We want a true culture of competition in Europe .
The state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the Commission must act as judge .
Another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful .
How do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back ?
This is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition .
You have shown us the way , Mr Monti , with the single market scoreboard .
It was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid .
Mr President , Commissioner , there are just two questions which must be answered .
The von Wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level .
Mr President , once again we are debating the European Union ' s competition policy .
Should we not be discussing this issue ?
We need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these private-sector monopolies .
When will we debate that ?
Workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights .
The competition policy has , as far as these resources permitted , contributed to this event .
What is being done may well be very important , but it is still not sufficient .
It is there to generate reactions and the White Paper has certainly succeeded in doing that .
It forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense .
Firstly , these relate to the coherence of the policy ' s application .
It is true , there are some European regulations and interpretative statements on the way .
Secondly , I understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty .
Many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern .
This instrument will fall by the wayside in future .
They are still in training , as it were .
What guarantees do we have that they will grow into first-class players in the league of the internal market ?
National competition authorities were able to apply Articles 81 ( 1 ) and 82 for some time .
A reform of this point was therefore also necessary .
The procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in Regulation 1762 .
The voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous .
It was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach .
One of the most frequent criticisms of Community competition law is its excessive red tape .
It was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis .
The White Paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals .
It is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report .
Secondly , Regulation 1762 must be repealed and replaced with a new regulation .
For these reasons , we are going to vote in favour of the report .
Frankly , I believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory .
Various arguments have been presented in its favour .
This is why I give this report my full support .
The truth is that the single market is not yet complete .
We daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe .
That is the context in which I want to consider the Commission 's proposals .
We look to him as the man to root out cartels .
The first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy .
I know that the Commission is set against this , but the potential exists .
I remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities .
I remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process .
Mr von Wogau said we can look to the European Court .
Well , we in Britain are looking to the European Court at the moment .
So , judicially , something needs to be done .
In relation to legal certainty , I endorse the point made by Mrs Thyssen .
It is important that business has legal certainty .
I mentioned this again to Commissioner Monti recently .
He said we must not always be carried along by lawyers .
I know there has been an analysis of the implications for the Commission of the change .
I would like to hear what Commissioner Monti has to say about that .
It is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies .
We can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision .
Society is surrendering itself to the economy .
That is precisely what we do not want in the European Union .
It is essential that this long overdue step be taken .
It is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection .
It is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of EU enlargement .
Indeed , it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the Treaty .
Mr President , Commissioner , competition is exactly what we need .
I say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this .
I believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures .
I find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation .
Regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper .
No other Member State is at such a disadvantage .
But opinion differs as to the solution .
In other words , we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse .
Both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system .
The Commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions .
This is unacceptable to my mind .
This is unacceptable in my view .
It would weaken a key element of European policy .
There was no majority for this at the time .
I consider this to be unacceptable .
The Commission suggests shorter deadlines .
I agree with this request .
In the interests of equality , either the Code must be applied or it must be modified .
We therefore await , and I await , the European Commission ' s proposals on this matter .
I agree with the rapporteur on two issues .
However , it must be " europeanised " taking into account the principle of subsidiarity .
The Commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition .
Society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business .
With what aim ?
Not to save jobs .
All these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies .
Did these firms need state aid to survive ?
No , car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years .
In this respect I have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions .
Firstly , it is necessary , in drawing up the legislation , to produce clear and complete rules .
The principle of competition must now be universal in its application .
The form the aid takes is important .
Forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported .
Mr Rapkay ' s report also emphasises the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law .
In his report , Karl von Wogau manages to capture this very well .
But Europe is changing .
The economies are growing , we are enlarging to 25-30 Member States .
The European Commission will become overburdened if it pursues its current policy .
It is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy .
This is not in question .
Having said this , I still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation .
In the Netherlands , the competition authority is still in its infancy .
Uniformity needs to be worked on .
What is the Commissioner ' s opinion of this ?
I would like to finish off by making an important point for small and medium-sized businesses .
Through cooperation , small , independent firms must be able to stand up to the large chains .
We all belong on the same boat and want to row with you .
The many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories .
I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be addressed .
Secondly , we have the issue of companies ' legal certainty .
We all agree on this .
On this point I will give my opinion on something which Mr Karas said .
There have only been nine rejections .
But here I would like to call on my experience as a lawyer .
This is therefore an aspect to be considered .
Thirdly , we have the problem of the uniform application of Community law .
In this respect , the excellent speech by Mrs Thyssen cannot be improved upon .
Here improvements should be made .
Only in certain countries , Germany for example , is there specialised jurisdiction .
Perhaps this is a promising avenue to explore , but we must also explore others .
In my opinion , Mr President , this joint debate fully bears this out .
At the end of the day , I honestly do not believe that this fear is justified .
This then is the idea of monitoring implementation .
I must say that I find this a very good idea that we will probably take up .
This goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns , Mrs Peijs .
We will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation .
Many speakers have underlined this .
The Commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs .
We are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for SMEs .
Is this simply a political gesture ?
Most SMEs have in fact less than 30 % of the market share .
The fourth group is legal certainty .
( FR ) Mrs Thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers .
The guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion .
I will mention only two , in order to be brief .
The first is greater transparency .
I am especially grateful for all of this .
Thank you , Commissioner Monti .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Protection under criminal law of the Union 's financial interests
The Union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative law when cases are exposed .
It is for the Member States to undertake criminal measures .
For it to enter into force , it must be ratified by all 15 Member States .
After five years only four have done so .
The second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings .
The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency .
There is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the Member States .
The Court of Justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts .
This moderation and thoughtfulness is particularly necessary in the implementation of Article 280 ( 4 ) .
The conclusions of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly .
Mr President , this , as Mrs Theato said , is a critical report .
We need to do something about it .
We need to take this responsibility seriously .
The question is : who prosecutes ?
That is where we really get into difficulty .
Whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that crosses so many frontiers ?
We need also to be sensitive to the concerns of Member States .
The proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one .
But the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the IGC to start discussions .
We are aware that it is a delicate debate .
But there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable .
Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Theato on her report .
Judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months , this could well be the case .
But the Member States failed to cooperate .
I myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic .
Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur .
Mrs Theato ' s report may help to restore confidence in European institutions .
Yet , every year we have the same problem .
It is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year .
I hope that the debate will convince a few more people .
Moreover , this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms .
So the legal framework , Mr President , is already in place .
It is fine , in principle .
It need only be fine-tuned .
Mr President , Mrs Theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason .
And indeed there is a twofold shift .
The Intergovernmental Conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this .
I do not believe so .
On the other hand , we can go a long way using the existing tools .
It is just such practical cooperation there is a need for .
However , it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an Office .
Instead , there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily .
Mr President , we all want to do something about combating European fraud .
But the question is now : is the European Union doing anything about it as well ?
The answer to this is that we know very little about this .
The Tampere Summit was about combating crime .
Everyone was supposedly pleased about it but , in reality , we have made little progress .
So a great deal has to be done in this area .
And what exactly should be done ?
Two things , and Mrs Theato ' s report clearly spells these out .
So , unification in this small area .
The European Public Prosecutor ' s Office is nothing to be afraid of .
I feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on .
It is , in fact , something very positive .
Parliament supports this .
The Committee of Wise Men supports this .
Mr President , I want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris .
I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue .
Corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation .
We need a public debate on this .
We need the Member States and the citizens in the Member States to be properly informed .
Another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law .
Article 280 of the Treaty allows the Council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to curb fraud .
We wanted to express our perplexity as regards these points by abstaining in committee .
We find ourselves dealing with some very serious events , which in the past seemed to be the norm .
This issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms .
Mr President , I would very much just like to add to two particular points .
Sometimes it is worthy of satire and merits discussion , but I digress .
The point I want to make relates to Mrs Theato ' s report .
I am referring to Recommendations 1 and 2 .
We obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis .
We also face difficulties with regard to offences .
Nothing has changed there .
As far as that is concerned , I believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome .
Nevertheless , it raises some very basic questions .
Mr President , the EU is now exposed to tough scrutiny .
Confidence in the European Union has been seriously damaged .
To remedy this , vigorous efforts are required .
We have more confidence in Eurojust , where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate .
The challenge for the Commission and for ourselves is , however , to find the right mix .
We therefore welcome the aggressive approach of Mr van Hulten ' s report .
Being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities .
Parliament is committed to this task , which is something this report bears impressive witness to .
The Commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation
I am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point .
Thank you , Commissioner Schreyer .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
( Parliament approved the Commission proposal )
Heaton-Harris ( PPE-DE ) .
I was wondering whether this is the correct procedure .
I know it takes longer , but should we not always have a show of hands first ?

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Own resources
. ( FR ) The European Union is apparently financed through four own resources .
This can be clearly seen in the regulation before us .
There is as yet no federal European tax .
Koch Report ( A5-0105 / 1999 )
Some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation .
Directive 96 / 35 / EC was a response to this requirement .
The Commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advisers is standardised .
Parliament voted in favour of this text .
Koch Report ( A5-0104 / 1999 )
This included a number of interim conditions valid until 1 January 1999 .
The CEN has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted .
Until then , there is really no point in Member States amending their national regulations .
They may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation .
Schroedter Report ( A5-0108 / 1999 )
I regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affairs .
I hope we can revisit this issue at a later time .
The Leader III scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year .
( FR ) This report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy .
In order to reduce disparities between regions , of course .
These guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of Community structural aid .
Amended again as such by the Schroedter report , they are a step in the right direction .
In the meantime , let us support this first step .
Although I wholeheartedly support this aim , I would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether .
Illegal state aid , by contrast , destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment .
The truth is though , that the Commission ' s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives .
In general , the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent .
Berend Report ( A5-0107 / 1999 )
We shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues .
It suggests that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be updated and strengthened .
It also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment , the environment and consumers into consideration .
This partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for Member States .
Admittedly , this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling .
It is a quite different Europe which is taking shape in the long term .
Is this not , indeed , what is so distressing to some Socialist Members of the European Parliament ?
Indeed , this is one advantage of the present system .
Rapkay Report ( A5-0078 / 1999 )
This is repulsive most of all in social terms .
Excessive in comparison with what iron rule , what criteria of efficiency ?
Finally , after Seattle , do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the WTO ?
Only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness .
Jonckheer Report ( A5-0087 / 1999 )
There is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition .
Clearly though , it must be monitored , a task which falls to the European Commission .
This downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new German Länder .
The European Commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible .
Langen Report ( A5-0073 / 1999 )
Finally , we have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty .
The aid system must effectively be continued beyond 2002 .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Oil slick off the French coast
The next item is the Commission statement on the oil slick off the French coast .
Mrs de Palacio will open the debate on behalf of the Commission .
Together with Mrs Grossetête and the PPE-DE Group , we tabled a motion for a resolution .
I am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion .
A disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the American coastline , and why ?
You told us that RINA was an Italian classification register recognised by the Commission .
What are the conditions for this recognition ?
What guarantees are there of its reliability ?
You are going to commission a fact-finding mission .
We await the outcome with great interest .
Inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within European ports must also be tightened up .
This obligation is not respected either in France or in many other European countries .
What conclusions has the Commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw ?
This disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area .
Here we are here again in this Parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster .
We need the Member States to act quickly and decisively .
It is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster .
The time for resolutions has passed .
What is now needed is action .
We all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying .
When will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident ? "
We absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again .
Why , in these circumstances , is the liability of Total as charterer not recognised ?
I can testify to this remarkable work .
Once again , there will be no clearly defined party responsible .
In the meantime , it is nature that is taking the rap , as always .
Our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers .
This is no longer tolerable .
Next , we have flags of convenience .
This is no longer tolerable .
Finally , there is the lack of transparency .
This is no longer tolerable .
Finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused .
I am thinking specifically of Total-Fina in the present instance .
Quite clearly , we are now paying the price for our lack of concern .
So today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion .
The question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the IMO .
It is up to the Members States and the Community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this .
This omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency .
The terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict .
I shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities .
This could be of a maximum of 15 years of age .
Thus , the Erika was refused access to American waters .
If the European Community had done the same , a great disaster would have been avoided .
And now the Erika .
Whose turn is next ?
And this is the result .
As an elected representative for the Loire-Atlantique region , unfortunately , I can testify to this .
There is nothing natural about these recurring disasters , they are the result of fate .
They are the result of human thoughtlessness .
What we have here is an ecological disaster .
Only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that .
The Erika disaster must be the last in the series .
First of all , we must shed some light on this shipwreck .
We know what actually happened .
This would be a minimum requirement , I believe , on the dawn of the third millennium .
I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group .
We urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks . The 15 clearly do not suffice .
These guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things .
This is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation .
However , we must aim higher in the long-term , let there be no mistake about that .
Many thanks for this .
Could I highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the Commissioner ?
But this is not in place .
Mr President , I would welcome some action in this area .
Mr President , we have already had this discussion so many times in the past .
So what are we to do now ?
I have no intention of talking about past events ; rather I want to look to the future .
What are we to do now ?
I will tell you a few things we should do .
Of course , we need double-hulled vessels .
So what do we need to happen immediately ?
If you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle .
This is what we need for ships .
We also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability .
This would be a marvellous exercise in supervision !
Environmental standards will be a recurring theme .
The unions will have something to say as will industry .
A long memory will serve us well , ladies and gentlemen .
We need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports .
If we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years ' time !
Mr President , Mrs Roth-Behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts .
We have now obtained a first-rate enumeration of a variety of measures .
But how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led ?
We must also critically examine the classification societies .
I do not think that we can accept their procedures .
We need independent procedures and procedures involving public control .
Within the Commission , the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing .
However , we must stick to the facts .
The ship Erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years .
I cannot accept this .
This can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous .
That is the only deterrent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit .
There are reputable companies too .
It could have sunk anywhere .
By now they are far away .
It is a miracle that they were saved .
Things could well continue in the same way .
Perhaps they are in lovely villas by lovely beaches , getting a nice tan .
We would like to know their names and their faces .
Finally , there must be improvements in the training of crews .
Mr President , I welcome the statement from the Commissioner .
This has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources .
They are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection .
I come from a region , Galicia , which has suffered similar accidents in the past .
I therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways .
On the other hand , prevention is essential .
In addition , I should like to make a number of comments :
That should be the starting point for our efforts .
Once we have done that , our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified .
I believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard .
We sometimes regulate things which could , by and large , remain subsidiary .
In this area we must respond to public opinion .
I hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hearing .
The cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker .
The International Maritime Organisation has issued international rules in this connection .
States can carry out port inspections .
It is clear that there is no lack of legislation .
In my opinion , the Commissioner is quite right .
Where the scheme falters is in the enforcement of existing legislation .
Should its implementation not be more strictly monitored ?
The Erika was built at a Japanese shipyard and is single-hulled .
There are four more sister ships in service at present .
Some of them also sail under the Maltese flag .
Are we waiting for the next accident to happen ?
Would sanctions not be appropriate , as the Commissioner stated , for the classification society ?
RINA is currently the talk of the town .
Malta is entering the accession negotiations .
Like so many others , I too wonder where the people responsible are .
Where are the shipowners and those who order the shipments when these disasters occur ?
This is not the first time we have seen oil slicks , whether intentional or unintentional .
( The President cut the speaker off )
I would like to thank Mrs Grossetête and her colleagues for bringing this motion before Parliament .
I salute these joint efforts to repair the damage .
This is clearly a problem for all EU coastlines which will require imaginative solutions .
There is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market picks up the tab .
Ultimately , the polluter must pay .
The victims are waiting outside .
They want answers .
Who will provide us with new jobs ?
That is why I welcome Mrs Palacio ' s action plan with open arms .
It is equally important to note that " prevention is better than cure " .
But there is an art to that as well .
We are particularly in the debt of those who undertook the difficult deployment of all their crew .
We are therefore right to demand improved controls , sanctions and preventive measures .
The issue is as topical as it was before .
Mrs Roth-Behrendt said that nothing had ever been done .
That is the reality .
Flags of convenience are one problem , but are not the only one .
Malta and Cyprus have asked to join the Community .
We must be demanding on this issue and we are negotiating to this end .
We already have legislation .
I will end now .
I will not expand further . We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
We have taken good note of your intentions .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.
Storms in Europe
The next item is the Commission statement on the storms in Europe .
Mr Barnier has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
I think that you must have done so , because you have not mentioned it .
We should therefore put this situation right immediately .
Let me explain .
The towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years .
It is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one .
Those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case .
We should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact .
What can the Members of the European Parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster ?
They have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens .
I am thinking in particular here of fish and shellfish companies , which have been particularly badly hit .
These are the terms of the written answer you gave Mr Martinez on 11 January 2000 .
I can show you a copy if you wish .
These storms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests .
I ask Member States to grasp this opportunity . This programme must work at full capacity .
These timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in Member States .
Current programmes must be accelerated .
The entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term .
However , it has now achieved notoriety .
Mr President , Commissioner , permit me , first of all , to make reference to two facts .
" We do not have the wherewithal for that , " they said .
This is wrong !
And no one can comprehend this attitude .
Certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at a complete loss .
The citizens of the European Union expect solidarity , also from within this Community .
I say they have a right to solidarity .
Indeed the European Parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need .
It knows the ins and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority .
The European Union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency .
We must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment .
It has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters .
There have always been natural disasters and there always will be .
Of course , there is a need for solidarity here .
Of course , I am in favour of providing assistance where we can .
The most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate .
We are fortunate in having the Gulf Stream .
But in common with others , we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect .
We must take more account of the guidelines produced at the Kyoto environmental conference .
Mr President , I think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victims .
This is an irreparable loss .
That is important .
It was very small .
So there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished .
I think we should reinstate this budget line .
These are major disasters , we should have an instrument , we do not have it .
What we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible .
That is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the warmer weather arrives .
For we all know how long it takes a tree to grow .
The calculations are in decades rather than years .
I am therefore very proud to say that the skilled Austrian forestry workers are also prepared .....
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , I extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms .
We had very little coverage in Ireland of the tanker that sank .
I was asked to highlight the result of the storms in Ireland .
I talked with farmers whose ewes were aborting their lambs due to drinking the infected water .
Natural habitats were destroyed .
So I ask that Ireland be remembered in this particular case .
I thank the Commissioner and support him very much in his European protection force .
I would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout Europe .
Unfortunately , we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will be taken at noon on Thursday .
I am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly .
The most discerning decisions are made by the consumers of Europe .
Between the agro-food sector and the farming sector there are over 10 million employees .
High levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness .
The challenge is to make the system the very best .
We are setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change .
The Commission will need the full support of Parliament if we are to achieve our ambitions on schedule .
We will also need the fullest support from the Council and other key stakeholders .
All of these measures are designed to make it more coherent , understandable and flexible .
We want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumers .
Over 80 measures are envisaged .
This idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate .
It has already attracted much comment , including reactions from Members of Parliament .
I will return to this process of consultation in a few moments .
Why should a European food authority be an essential part of that structure of change ?
The first key concern is independence .
We must also ensure excellence and transparency .
However , the Commission believes that we must go further .
We must create a permanent and truly independent , excellent and transparent system of risk assessment .
The key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety .
As the White Paper makes clear , the new authority must be a value-added structure .
This proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority .
I make no apology for this approach ; I firmly believe that it is the correct one .
I do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of passion .
I will be very interested to hear the views of Parliament itself in relation to this matter .
There are also those who argue that the Commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority .
I also reject this line of argument .
Would this be in the interests of Europe 's citizens ?
It seems difficult to envisage such a situation evolving .
This is a major task .
The authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues .
I am also anxious to hear the views of Parliament in this regard .
The White Paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls .
I want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena .
Parliament will have a key part to play in this debate .
Parliament played a crucial role in Europe 's response to the BSE crisis .
I expect that Parliament 's contribution to the debate on the authority can be as incisive and constructive .
It is essential that we get the mix right .
Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for his statement .
That is very much the right approach .
But there is one word that I have not heard you mention here tonight .
I hope that we can thrash this out .
It is very important that we include liability in that process .
That is the one word I am talking about .
The problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong .
That cannot continue .
My questions relate to the positive list for animal feed .
You are unclear about this in your White Paper .
What is your schedule , how long will it take you to produce a positive list ?
Thank you , Commissioner , for your statement .
We look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this .
Mrs Ahern raised the issue of liability .
Once that is done , issues such as liability can be addressed .
But I have taken on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration .
Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list .
Rapid alert is there for food but not for feed .
There is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind .
I also welcome the White Paper .
All this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the European Union .
I would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location ?
In addition to that , the food safety authority will have a board .
You will notice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board .
I envisage that the board 's membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders .
We have not done that yet but it will be done in September .
That would erode the independence of the scientific advice .
Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that .
That is an issue for consideration and discussion .
There may be a number of views on that .
It is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out .
Mr Florenz also raised the question of anonymity .
It must be visible .
It must be known .
Consumers in the European Union must know of the existence of the food authority .
It is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous .
It must be visible .
I will do everything I can to promote that high profile role for the authority .
Mrs Lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth .
There would have to be an interaction at scientific level .
That is an undesirable situation , we do not want that situation in the future .
This situation can be achieved over a period of time .
You cannot legislate for consumer confidence . It is something that is earned over a period of time .
In relation to grants and subsidies : yes , consideration has been given to that issue .
Mrs Myller then asked me about the location of the Authority .
But the FVO is in quite a different situation from the Food Safety Authority .
The Food Safety Authority 's situation is quite different .
It seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located .
That is my judgement at the moment .
As you can see , half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session .
That concludes the debate .
Question Time ( Commission )
The next item is Question Time ( B5-0003 / 2000 ) . We will examine questions to the Commission .
We will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to Question Time .
Mr Purvis has the floor for a procedural motion .
That is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda .
I hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event .
Question No 28 by ( H-0781 / 99 ) :
Mr Verheugen has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
According to our information , the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet .
Thank you for your reply .
I should like to make the following points : Turkey is now a candidate country .
This plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2 % .
So much for the political aspect .
In cases such as this , where there is uncertainty , simulators are used .
However , we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy .
I have explained the position of the Commission .
You have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety .
In the case of Turkey it is different .
The plant is not yet there .
I do not have these concerns .
Question No 29 by ( H-0786 / 99 ) :
If not , why not ?
Mrs Wallström has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
Thank you , Mr Bowe , for your question .
None of the subsequent evidence or analysis has overturned that original assessment .
First of all , Mr President , can I thank the Commissioner for that very useful response .
How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons ?
Thank you , Mr Bowe , for that question .
That is also mentioned in the report .
The problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted .
It also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons .
That is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do .
In the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution .
That also includes bullets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system .
I cannot answer that question .
Of course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information .
Question No 30 by ( H-0793 / 99 ) :
Many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way .
When will the Commission appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet ?
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
The concerns expressed by the European Parliament about Tibet are widely shared .
We again urged the Chinese to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama .
I urge the Chinese again to do so .
We will continue to raise Tibet with the Chinese authorities .
Let me make clear to the honourable Member what the position is .
As it happens , we deal with the budgetary consequences , the Council makes the appointment .
Some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course .
I repeat that we have made our position known to the Chinese on Tibet .
I have much sympathy with what the honourable Member has said about cultural heritage and about the Buddhist tradition .
Like the honourable Member I have read the autobiography of the Dalai Lama .
The Commission , like others , has urged dialogue .
The Dalai Lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes .
Question No 31 by ( H-0795 / 99 ) :
Are these reports accurate ?
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
The Commission will then adopt the code at second reading .
The code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the Commission 's administration with the public .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner .
The newspaper reports were misleading .
I do not think there is any difference between us and the Ombudsman .
It is extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member .
I want to thank the Commission for what I perceive as a very positive answer .
The only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis .
As the author is not present , Question No 32 lapses .
I apologise to Mr Vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy . I am sorry .
According to the Rules of Procedure , you are not required to reply .
I wish you a good evening .
Questions to Mr Nielson , who is replaced by Mr Patten
The training of staff moving to the delegations in the different regions is another entry point .
The training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory .
It is not to be brought in as a " sort of optional add-on " .
In addition , measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender .
It would appear that we are in agreement about this .
Only one manager has participated in gender training , and for half a day .
That is naturally unacceptable .
That goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority .
So I sympathise very much with what the honourable Member has said .
The major part of European Union aid has been provided under the TACIS programme .
These programmes have benefited Kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent , Tajikistan .
Over the same period , Kyrgyzstan received EUR 17 million .
I am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them .
I have heard the honourable Member talk in the past about the Caucasus as well .
So the honourable Member 's remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made .
We are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact .
There is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to .
This is not the usual state of affairs .
And furthermore the Commissioner has not quoted from his bibliography this time .
Thank you very much , Mr Patten , for your interventions today .
Question No 35 by ( H-0778 / 99 ) :
Thank you , Commissioner for your reply .
You tell me that you , as the Commission , have made recommendations .
I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommendations will be adhered to .
However , my question for a very long time has been this : what happened with previous policies ?
Did anyone find work ?
How many people found work ?
What has been done about training ?
Is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instructors or trainees ?
Do we have any figures ?
The action which the Commission can take relates to the specific guidelines .
As you know , there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated .
Question No 36 by ( H-0782 / 99 ) :
Some workers have complained to the European Commission because they do not have the right to retire .
So I should be grateful if the Commissioner could enlarge upon this question .
I think that the answer is brief and clear .
Of course it is as you say .
There will be no problem with Danish nationals within Denmark , that is not where the problem lies .
The problem is with Danish nationals or other nationals residing outside Denmark .
Question No 37 by ( H-0791 / 99 ) :
Question No 38 by ( H-0805 / 99 ) :
Which Commissioners are members of this group ?
How many meetings of the group have been held to date ?
What concrete measures have been discussed ?
This question covers several individual matters .
It refers to the special Commission working group dealing with questions of equality .
The Commissioners taking part are President Prodi , Vice-President Kinnock , Mr Reding and myself .
The meetings of the working group are open and the first meeting was held on 11 January 2000 .
Mrs Avilés-Perea , that was an exhortation rather than a question .
But if the Commissioner wishes to offer doctrine or good intentions ...
Question No 39 by ( H-0807 / 99 ) :
What criteria will the Commission use to approve or reject the Member States ' programmes ?
The EQUAL initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people .
Its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace .
This is an important aspect of this initiative .
It has been submitted to Parliament and we expect Parliament ' s opinion next month .
The last question concerns the amount granted .
Question No 40 by ( H-0808 / 99 ) :
The ban on discrimination is the rule in the package of directives and programmes which we submitted .
These exceptions relate to professions which must be exercised by persons with a genuine professional qualification .
Allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this .
That is the sort of exemption we are talking about .
This is a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination .
Here we have from the Commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression .
In other words , it is positive discrimination .
That is the only form of exemption which is acceptable .
Question No 41 by ( H-0813 / 99 ) :
I am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to .
I can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need .
Question No 42 by ( H-0817 / 99 ) :
These discussions have already started , but we will need to take account of the results in Lisbon .
These results will be most important in shaping the Commission ' s social programme .
Question No 44 by ( H-0819 / 99 ) :
What measures is the Commission taking to facilitate opportunities for the disabled in this area ?
I would thank the Commissioner for her answer .
I am grateful for the fact that the Commission has adopted an action plan .
It has not yet been passed by the Council ; it is at the consultation stage .
I think that a strategic decision of this sort can be taken at European level .
Question No 45 by ( H-0006 / 00 ) :
We are waiting to see what the next move will be .
Firstly , no attempt is being made to change the system in Denmark or in any other country .
And this is the direction in which we expect the Danish and the other nine governments to move .
Thank you very much , Commissioner , for your dedication .
We congratulate you .
That concludes Question Time .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.50 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
We asked for a whistle-blower ' s regulation , and this is now in place .
Parliament wanted financial inspection and audit functions to be separated .
This has now been done .
Parliament requires a code of conduct for Commissioners and Cabinets .
This is in place too .
Parliament asked the Commission to waive its excessive privileges .
It did this as well .
The Commission has also entered into commitments to cooperate with Parliament in terms of SEM 2000 .
Fundamental changes will also be considered for the technical assistance offices .
We want more than that , however .
The Commission should now produce an ambitious and far-reaching reform programme .
We now demand from the European Commission clear pledges concerning the following points .
Firstly , Parliament must have complete access to all Commission documents .
If the current draft is correct , then this is a huge step backwards in comparison to today .
I would quote Gaza as an example .
Mr President , since 1996 , the discharge has acquired a heavy , political significance .
This is why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow .
However , we are not surrendering this weapon without placing a time bomb in its place .
We cannot have a decisive and fair Europe unless it is also open and democratic .
All institutions must now join forces in order to work together towards building this type of Europe .
They were not unique to 1997 and two strands seem to run through them .
That cannot excuse everything that we came across .
Citizens of Europe expect the European institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so .
From what I have seen of the reform process , it looks good .
But we need that reform process .
It is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it .
It groups them together and that is very important .
There are two issues I would like to draw your attention to .
One is nuclear safety in Eastern Europe .
We have to get this right .
The Committee of Independent Experts said the Commission was not managing this properly .
We have to remedy that .
The second point is about scrutiny mechanisms .
We need from the Commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending .
The Socialist Group will be voting to grant discharge .
I am sure you will be relieved to hear that as well .
But that is not to say that we are satisfied , and that everything in the garden is rosy .
It is clear that a radical overhaul of the Commission is long overdue .
It indicates , however , that we acknowledge that steps are being made in the right direction .
We need to make it much easier to prosecute officials who are guilty of fraud and corruption .
I have just heard now that an audit progress board is going to be set up by the Commission .
We want to see that follow-through to a much greater extent in future .
The other issue is access to confidential documents .
We have put down an amendment to that effect .
The situation there is totally unacceptable .
I would like to congratulate Lousewies van der Laan .
We are discussing last year ' s discharge , but also the Commission ' s responsibility .
I would like to raise the problems which are still piled up high on our desks .
It is about a Commission which is no more .
There is now a new Commission .
The problems remain and this gives rise to doubts .
Mr Kinnock will present his proposal next month .
It is clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur has also struggled .
This dilemma stretches beyond the areas which I have already listed .
Take , for example , the pledges made by the Commission . They look good in themselves .
I have read a few documents written by Mr Kinnock and we have every confidence in them .
The previous speaker already said something about this .
This is an illustration of empty pledges not necessarily leading to good results .
This also applies to whistle-blowers .
We have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type .
Clear progress must be visible .
In that year , we voted against granting discharge .
As a result , we shall vote against granting discharge for 1997 , too .
It is both good and necessary that reforms have been promised .
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 1997 .
The report on so-called discharge contains a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the accounts .
We do not think that the new Commission , under any circumstances , could incur liability for the past .
We think it is wrong to talk about the Commission ' s liability as an institution .
There is no reason why , against this background , we should agree to grant discharge .
That is just the way things are , however .
This question ought to have been asked when the new Commission was appointed .
We will be in a position to judge just as soon as the Commission presents its reform programme .
I have no doubt further reform of EU institutions will be analysed in this debate .
The old mindset which involved sweeping things under the carpet and protecting one ' s friends unfortunately still exists .
I am referring here especially to the earlier scandals involving ECHO .
From the outside , it looks as if the Commission has something to hide .
My investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case .
It was this practice which led to the Commission ' s downfall .
Thank you , Commissioner Schreyer .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Response to Second Report of Committee of Independent Experts
Within a few hours of the presentation of the report President Santer announced the resignation of his entire team .
The new Commission has already taken important steps to move away from the way it used to function .
A code of conduct for Commissioners and their private offices has been adopted .
New rules have been drawn up and implemented governing the appointment of senior officials .
The number of departments has been reduced .
In order to achieve this , action is required in four areas .
First , financial management and control within the Commission must be improved .
One of the main problems is the lack of a functioning system of financial control .
A new independent audit system service must be set up .
It is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time .
Urgent change is required today .
Third , standards in European public life must be upheld .
A number of codes have since been introduced .
They must be assessed by Parliament and should be made legally binding .
Whistle-blowers who act in good faith must be protected .
They must be implemented without delay .
Crucially , reforms must not be limited to the Commission .
Finally , the Commission 's human resource policy must be modernised .
It is clearly no longer suited to the requirements of a modern , multinational organisation .
A career with the European institutions must become more attractive .
Too many young , new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years .
The promotions procedure must be made fairer and more transparent .
It must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions .
Commissioner Kinnock will , tomorrow , present his communication on reform .
This communication must contain a clear timetable .
Enlargement of the Union is just a few years away .
There is a very simple way to deal with those stories .
Let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism .
Our greatest concern in the EPP is to ensure that public confidence in the European Commission is restored .
This was , after all , one of the causes of the downfall of the last Commission .
Have the lessons not been learnt ?
We believe the vast number of recommendations of the Wise Men ' s report should be implemented .
In a nutshell : there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available .
Our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget .
Can I first thank Mr van Hulten for this report .
It is an excellent report .
Can I invite Mr Elles not to put the cart before the horse .
I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for all his efforts so far .
He has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change .
Central to this is the attempt to produce and engender responsibility .
It is clear that we need to see a change in the Financial Regulation .
That is important .
We need to stop people passing the buck from one to another .
Where failure is occurring within the Commission we need to hold people responsible .
We need to be assured that consistent under-performance must lead to dismissal .
I will give you one example of this .
It is clear that is not acceptable .
What happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation ?
We recognise that most of the officials within the Commission are extremely hard-working .
But we also recognise that some of the practices are outdated .
We also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones .
We have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves .
Our own staff policy is outdated .
Some of our working practices need radical reform .
We recognise the proposals on activity-based budgeting .
Finally , can I say that the Commission needs to work on its relationships with the public .
European taxpayers need to be re-assured .
That is the key issue , delivery of these proposals .
We have submitted an amendment to this effect .
The Commission ' s records leave a great deal to be desired .
I would also like to say a few words about ex post financial control .
Is this possible ?
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank Mr van Hulten .
It is his first report here in plenary .
It is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late .
Let us be honest .
The second report of the Wise Men arrived in September .
We are now four months down the line .
Meanwhile , Mr van Hulten has been inundated with amendments , more than 100 amendments in the first round .
Might Mr Kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening ?
I also look forward to the White Paper which will be available in February .
Mr President , this report is positive but , actually , we need more than this .
Fraud , mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere .
Via the structural funds , a great deal of the European budget is being pumped around the system .
Even the strictest control cannot solve this problem .
There is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous Commission .
Allow me to start with the most important demand .
We do not want financial control to be abolished .
Mr President , firstly I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague , Mr van Hulten .
I would in any case like to congratulate him on his report .
This is the best support we can give to European democracy .
Mr van Hulten , I think you deserve a medal for your efforts .
There are two points which , in my opinion , deserve special attention on the part of the ELDR .
Firstly , there is the Commissioners ' individual responsibility .
This must be regulated during the IGC .
This will contribute hugely towards re-establishing the confidence of the European citizens in this institution .
It now appears that this desire is more serious .
This Parliament anxiously awaits this complete reform programme .
Commissioners should not be considered senior officials but rather politicians in office .
Perhaps the reference to the posts is imprecise .
Naturally , this is only to be welcomed .
And so it is the " two key " principle that applies here .
A single key is to suffice in future .
What we really need to focus on , however , is making the checks more effective .
However , the financial controllers must work independently .
Therefore , independence is prerequisite for effective checks .
I believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow ' s vote .
Mrs Theato has already expressed as much and I am only too willing to support her in this regard .
This was stupid of the old Commission , and Parliament was of no help on that occasion .
There are too many rights , too many regulations and too little room for leadership .
There is no backbone , and no teeth .
Where is the beef ?
Romano Prodi promised a revolution .
Sort out the tangle of staff allowances .
Ensure too , that training becomes a management tool .
We have not done this so far , and this is something you ought to be instrumental in changing .
So I refer to the things I do not agree with .
I do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to Parliament .
This report is about the Commission .
Parliament is a separate subject .
There is no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission .
In addition to that , there is the question of duty-free .
It is not worthy of being brought into this report either .
Most of the report is about financial control .
That is reasonable because it comes from the Budgetary Control Committee .
After all , it is only 1 % of GDP , by comparison with national spending .
We should get it into perspective .
It is important to remember that .
The business of the European Commission is very little about spending money .
They have very little of it .
They have a much wider responsibility .
I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust .
That is a gross exaggeration of what the difficulties were .
Mr President , I should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report .
I hope that the Commission will use it in its reform work .
The Commission ' s administration simply does not function particularly well .
There is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy .
The Financial Regulation should be amended .
We agree that we should have better control of the finances .
It is just a question of how .
We should be careful about this .
We should retain some form of ex ante financial control .
It is not enough simply to carry out spot checks once the money has been spent .
This would allow too many anomalous projects to slip through .
Instead , we should be reforming and decentralising control .
The Commission does not have enough staff .
The staffing system is too rigid .
There should be a more frequent rotation of employees , especially at the top of the hierarchy .
It should also be much easier to sack inefficient and incompetent employees .
I am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed .
Perhaps this is a little worrying .
First of all , we need tough regulations , which can be implemented .
Codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough .
These are what are missing .
The van Hulten report is a step in the right direction , but it is not enough .
It is the European Parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation .
Mr President , I would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report .
I would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement , also with its amendments .
A very important proposal indeed .
I cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale .
In my opinion , such a far-reaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary .
Finally , the issue of officials .
Actually , I do not entirely share Mr Haarder ' s view .
I do agree that the section on officials has , in fact , been completed totally inadequately .
The experts think that this problem will be resolved by banning the Commissioners from belonging to political groups .
This lesson in wisdom is 100 % ideology and 0 % knowledge .
Meanwhile , we have to offer the Commission a vote of confidence .
' Long-winded ' .
I am not going to mention the length of this report .
It is also ' confusing ' .
The concept of transparency stands out in the report .
Securing this is a major priority .
The importance of smooth-running , comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough .
We must win back their faith in EU politics .
This is what enables them to understand what is going on .
I thank him and I wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative .
Naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than is absolutely necessary .
I am sure that Mr Pomes Ruiz is encouraged by that .
I would say to Mr Elles that we are most definitely in listening mode .
Hence the transmission .
Turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations .
That most certainly is the intention of the Commission .
Financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform .
Several Members have made that point again in the course of today 's debate .
Parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital .
Change in the law is fundamental .
That service will open on 1 May this year .
This Audit Progress Board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audits .
That committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa .
It was clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control .
I do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this .
The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed .
We are seeking to implement best practice .
As a corollary , there will be safeguards for officials who are the subject of false allegations .
A communication later this year will give full details .
I do not think Parliament will be disappointed by what we will propose .
A communication in June will set out the full proposal for change .
Standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the House .
That is in line with the draft resolution .
I welcome Parliament 's support for that .
The draft resolution rightly recalls the Commission 's accountability to this Parliament .
The point was very properly raised by Mr Elles and referred to by Mrs Thors .
We are now waiting for Parliament to decide when it wishes to begin negotiations on the text .
We are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible .
The report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform .
It certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities .
A series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months .
Each of them will be available for reflection and response by this House .
The early thoughts of Parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome .
That is most certainly relevant .
Parliament has frequently made that point .
Thirdly , it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken .
They are already having implications for resource availability .
The Commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of Mr van Hulten 's report .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
( The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m. )
Middle East peace process ( continuation )
Such is life .
So I hope I can count on the understanding of the House on this occasion .
It is not something , I assure you , which I would wish to make a practice of .
At the same time we must not lose sight of the Palestinian track .
The situation of the Palestinians has always been the core issue of the conflict .
Although there has been some slippage , I trust that the remaining Israeli troop redeployments will materialise soon .
We are charged with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development .
Nor is our role confined to that of banker .
We must be prepared to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region .
The Commission is already considering the implications for the European Union of the recent encouraging developments .
We intend to share our more detailed thoughts on the matter with Parliament and Council soon .
We are the largest of all donors to the Palestinians .
President Arafat will be meeting the Council of Ministers next week .
The Commission is actively involved in those efforts .
We committed more than EUR 20 million for such projects last year .
I want to underline that point .
We have made progress in recent months and weeks , as Mr Gama mentioned earlier .
But it is inevitably going to be a tough process with difficulties and disappointments on the way .
I hope the House will understand that .
Mr President , Commissioner Patten has our understanding .
In this sense , I share Commissioner Patten ' s positive attitude .
We in Parliament strongly support the Middle East peace process .
It is , of course , a peace process which is finally under way .
I want to emphasise four points .
The second point relates to Syria .
There , the border question is obviously central .
How negotiations are proceeding there , we still do not know .
What is important , however , is that they have begun .
An important question in this context is the future distribution of water .
My last point concerns the future Palestinian State .
This is something to which we all want to contribute .
The recent negotiations are already an important step towards a permanent peace in the Middle East .
It is , therefore , regrettable that these peace talks have been suspended for the time being .
Indeed , both parties will need to make huge efforts .
This is where Mr Solana , the High Representative to the Council , could come into his own .
There are still , needless to say , many unresolved problems and unanswered questions , also involving the Palestinians .
The moment of truth is approaching .
Will Israel let Palestinian refugees return or be given compensation ?
Will Israel share Jerusalem and the water of the River Jordan ?
Will a free Palestine be a truly democratic state and , therefore , reliable as a partner in peace ?
Peace in the Middle East concerns us all , however .
It is therefore good that the EU should act as a godparent to the Palestinian state .
However , Israel is not the only country concerned with security .
All the international community has to do is implement Resolutions 332 , 248 , 245 and 194 .
Indeed , the time has come to resolve a central problem for global stability .
Oz ' s impression is also echoed in the Israeli press .
And the Israelis were certainly not impressed by the discourteous behaviour of Minister Farouk al-Shara in Shepherdstown .
His behaviour towards Prime Minister Ehud Barak was plainly insulting .
Well , the Syrians are quite possibly cutting off their nose to spite their face .
I would like to finish off by asking the European Council and Commission a question .
The application of the framework agreement between the Palestinian authorities and Israel is also suspended at the moment .
What can the European Union do in these circumstances ?
Unfortunately , very little .
But we have enough agreements now : Oslo , Wye Plantation , Sharm el-Sheikh .
We have enough agreements ; they just need to be implemented .
My second point concerns the resumption of negotiations between Syria and Israel .
I consider this to be very encouraging news .
That would be a similar situation .
My third and last point concerns the role of the European Union .
Dare we hope for a dual peace agreement between Israel and its neighbours to the north ?
We really hope and believe so .
Never have the parties been so determined .
Like other Arab countries before them , the Syrians chose the Americans to sponsor the negotiations .
The same is true with regard to immigration policy .
We hope that the Council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this Parliament .
Fulfil your obligations to Parliament in a generous spirit , thus preparing for the future .
Our relations with third countries represent another important aspect of the fight against organised crime .
I hope to have a debate with the European Parliament and with civil society on this scoreboard project .
Unfortunately , however , it has highlighted the difficulties rather than proposing solutions .
Agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda .
We welcome the fact that Europol has finally been able to start work .
Thirdly : the extension to Parliament ' s rights in this context .
I just want to highlight three areas among many where we need quick progress .
The first is asylum .
Decisions on asylum should take months - not years .
The last area I want to mention is convergence of civil and criminal justice systems .
Whatever the Eurosceptics say , it is in all our interests to get cooperation in such matters .
I hope that it works out .
Numerous questions are still outstanding .
Answers are still awaited .
Regulations on nationality and the integration of people from third countries are still outstanding .
On the other hand , quite specific action has been called for on the subject of safety of life .
The creation of a Charter of Fundamental Rights will be one of the important projects in the immediate future .
The Europol agreement has now officially entered into force .
In Tampere , the question of granting operational powers was discussed .
The agreement also attracts criticism with regard to EURODAC .
Parliament has amended the contractual text .
Care must be taken to ensure that the Council complies with Parliament ' s modus operandi .
And yet we owe this to the citizens of Europe .
I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can contribute positively to this .
This is the sine qua non condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres .
The virtually systematic conditions of detention and the criminalisation of asylum-seekers are no longer acceptable .
All asylum-seekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensory effect .
They were treated like the worst criminals .
The Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this type of barbaric behaviour .
Our role should be to accompany , reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships .
The laws against racism must be harmonised .
What direction do you intend to give to Article 13 of the EC Treaty ?
What do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in wages for men and women ?
How do you aim to eradicate homophobia , racism and sexism ?
We must take the best from each of our countries .
Immigration is too often a synonym for insecurity and violence and purely repressive responses .
The level of racism in our society is terrifying .
And our current EU mantra is AFSJ : Area for Freedom , Security and Justice .
And who is not in favour of security , freedom and justice ?
The agenda is not designed to secure justice for the citizen .
That is already secured by means of the various national legal systems .
First of all , the initiatives which have been planned are completely unrealistic .
It also , of course , finds indirect expression in the question .
Mr President , today the people of Northern Ireland see a strange irony .
Let me just look at the figures from the day that the agreement was signed .
In 1998 , we had 55 murders .
Between 1998 and 1999 , loyalists assaulted and shot 123 people , while republicans assaulted and shot 93 people .
Mr President , that situation cannot continue and needs remedying .
Mr President , the Treaty of Amsterdam has set an important objective for the Union .
The Euro , employment , even security , are not enough .
They need a ' European soul ' , as a distinguished Spanish professor once said .
This trio 's words were like music to our ears as Mr Ceyhun has said .
As with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly orchestrated .
Many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months .
That is an area that European citizens will respond to and will be happy about .
Mr Schulz said earlier on that he was not certain about the definition of ' scoreboard ' .
Anyone who is English or British or follows cricket knows what a scoreboard is .
I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino will make certain that is so .
I would like to make three brief points .
Involve us please in your discussions on both policy and process .
My second point is that we need a properly resourced Commission .
We have established a new Directorate-General , yet it has only 70 people all told .
We are setting the Commission a massive task , not least in the drawing up of the scoreboard .
The Council and Parliament must work together to provide the resources that the Commission needs .
All good things come in threes , especially in our policy area .
The role of the Court of Justice is still too limited and communitisation is incomplete .
The unilateral decision by Belgium to re-establish border controls is a clear illustration of this .
We know that readmission clauses are included in the cooperation and association agreements .
Yet these represent a serious threat to the principle of ' non-refoulement ' [ no turning back ] .
However , the main concern remains ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
I thank them for their statements to the House .
This is a Belgian government measure which flies in the face of the Schengen Treaty .
I lodged a written complaint on the same subject to Commissioner Vitorino on 23 December .
I refer to Eurodac .
We were of the opinion that EURODAC was becoming a reality .
Even in Tampere , we were of the opinion that Eurodac was becoming a reality .
This is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see .
If you tell us today how you wish to proceed , you will be doing us a great service .
Do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immigration ?
I have great expectations for the Portuguese Presidency .
But I want to add a word of caution .
There are also courts in Karlsruhe , London , Lisbon , Dublin and Edinburgh .
We must make sure that what we do makes clear sense .
But we must look always to subsidiarity .
( Sustained applause )
Thank you , Minister .
The debate is closed .
Mr President , I am grateful for the Council ' s oral , and also written , reply .
Their efficiency has been truly remarkable .
I also hope that the same is done in relation to parliamentary control .
Question Time ( Council )
The next item is Question Time ( B5-0003 / 2000 ) . We will examine questions to the Council .
Question No 1 by ( H-0780 / 99 ) :
Thank you for your answer .
However , I would just like to add the following .
Turkey is only looking to increase its energy potential by 2 % with this unit .
My second point concerns the safety of these plants .
That is our role and this is the point of my question .
I recognise the relevance of the arguments that Mr Souladakis has put forward .
This is , of course , a highly sensitive issue .
Thank you , Mr President and thank you President-in-Office of the Council .
Will you write to me before the next plenary with that information ?
I do not consider that the Council tried to answer my question .
Instead , my question concerns the interpretation in principle of Article 255 of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
I should like to have an answer to that question .
Mr Sjöstedt , the answer that I gave was the only answer possible .
The European Parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next Intergovernmental Conference .
The matter is still open .
For our part , we are prepared to study any proposals made in this area .
It is a very important question indeed which Jonas Sjöstedt and others have asked .
We can now see that there is perhaps some reason for this warning from Parliament .
Mr Dimitrakopoulos , transparency is naturally an issue of concern to the institutions .
We will then see , at ministerial level , how we can follow this up .
As far as we are concerned , they will be .
We shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter .
Question No 5 by ( H-0785 / 99 ) :
I understand that Portugal is affected by this .
Question No 6 by ( H-0788 / 99 ) :
It will not be tolerated , and must stop immediately .
I would like to thank Mr President-in-Office of the Council .
The United Nation ' s , and Mr Kouchner ' s , mission in Kosovo ended in failure .
Therefore , the responsibility of the European Union has to be seen in a certain context .
We have endeavoured to provide material help .
We have tried to defend peace by taking military action .
There are two fundamental questions in particular .
We advocate that it should be implemented in its entirety .
Mr Seixas da Costa , I totally agree with you .
Does the Council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of Kosovo ?
Question No 8 by ( H-0796 / 99 ) :
However , housing is specifically excluded .
Question No 9 by ( H-0798 / 99 ) :
I thank the President-in-Office for his reply .
We also have to think of the consequences , especially in terms of financing and compensating farmers .
The Council ' s ability to intervene in this matter is strictly limited .
It should be pointed out that this can only be done within the Council ' s scope for action .
You said that in Lisbon you intend to discuss more dynamic and competitive development .
I do not see how you could , with the views that you hold , provide any answers .
We will try to move these strategies forward as much as possible during our presidency .
Question No 12 by ( H-0801 / 99 ) :
But there are some questions still outstanding .
There does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme .
I hope that the Minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue .
As you can understand , it would be easy to do so .
Does the presidency intend to do anything about this ?
Since the author is not present , Question No 13 lapses .
Please allow me to remark on how well-versed and well-informed he is on European affairs .
It remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this .
I appreciate that it is a provocative question .
I cannot think of a better way to do it .
Can you ?
Intergovernmental Conferences are a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of Christmas tree .
Mr Dimitrakopoulos has the floor for a procedural motion .
I would ask him to be brief .
Mr President , I understand that I have to do this very quickly .
I liked what Mr Seixas da Costa said about Father Christmas .
In Spain they say a letter to the three kings .
We thank Mr Seixas da Costa , but he can also write his letter to the three kings .
That concludes questions to the Council .
The next item is the joint debate on :
This question has been debated in several national parliaments of the EU .
Madam President , I do not have a great deal to add on this subject .
Mr Désir too has mentioned this growing interest on all sides .
In that case , the tax could lead to a net loss of total economic prosperity .
For the reasons set out above , I cannot see a good reason for introducing a European Tobin tax .
I consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reasons .
Why do we reject the Tobin tax and consider it so questionable ?
Secondly , speculative capital is extremely difficult to identify .
The measure which we should be taking is part of the resolution before us here today .
We need stronger banking supervision .
We need to clarify the liability for transactions .
We need a framework of regulations at international level .
I refer to point 9 .
Madam President , the debate on a tax on short-term financial actions is not a new one .
We need to know just how desirable and feasible a tax on short-term transactions really is .
It is important that we know who the actors are and what their credit rating is .
We must also ask if there is not a need for fiscal justice .
In itself , globalisation is positive .
As I have said , we are not opposed to such a study .
This argument is therefore not relevant .
I will not go into the basic issue any further for everyone has their arguments .
Unemployment and pressure on employees worldwide is increasing .
This has already been made clear a number times in this debate .
It seems to me blindingly self-evident that some action is necessary .
Mr Chirac has described those who engage in this as the Aids virus of the world economy .
I am disappointed in the EPP .
I thought at least they read the resolutions they were going to vote on .
There is nothing so closed as a closed mind .
This issue can no longer be ignored by Parliament , the Council or the Commission .
I have two or three points to make in this respect .
We cannot maintain a situation in which income from non-economic activities increases more and more quickly .
Nor do I believe that this is impracticable .
There must be an overriding economic interest .
We are looking for solutions .
The Tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obscure question .
We citizens of the world cannot afford the current rate of speculation .
To continue would be economic suicide .
The danger is too great for us to ignore .
We ought to face it regardless of how difficult it may seem .
We needed a Greek Member to finally tell us what this Tobin tax means .
You reject it flatly because you do not understand the first thing about it .
We all know that !
They are all tarred with the same dirty brush !
We need a Tobin tax to give us a fiscal instrument with which we can intervene .
He should perhaps use his position on the Tobin tax to ask himself why he is here at all !
Madam President , I too have found parts of the debate quite bizarre .
We have asset inflation of global proportions .
And it is precisely the medium-sized undertakings and large numbers of employees who suffer as a result .
We can take action against this ; it is possible .
That too is feasible .
Madam President , let us indeed tax money speculation : it does not produce anything new .
The tax would be targeted at the right place : at the speculators .
Who is going to defend these speculators , when nurses and teachers are paying top rates of tax ?
The low rate Tobin tax would not cause tax-recycling problems .
In the end tax would politicise the global , undemocratic system of financial power .
I would like to start by underlining two remarks made by the Member of your Parliament , Mr Gasòliba .
He said that globalisation is a positive phenomenon , and I share his view .
I think that he is correct in this regard .
I think that this will be problematic .
Is it the case that these countries can boast of what is termed in English ' good governance ' ?
Is it the case that there is low inflation and that there are low interest rates ?
That the markets for production factors , including the labour market , operate flexibly ?
That is not always the case .
I thank you for giving me the opportunity to take part in this debate .
Madam President , unfortunately I do not have your mastery of the French language .
Could you please draw his attention to the fact that I have something to say to him ?
Monsieur Bolkestein , je veux vous dire quelque chose !
Unfortunately , my Dutch is not as good as yours .
But I would rather like to say something else to you .
Parliament is not taking the initiative and supporting a Tobin type tax just to annoy the Commission .
We want to examine the possibility of introducing a Tobin tax .
It also has something to do with the newly awoken self-consciousness of this Parliament .
I just want to discuss it with you , no more and no less .
Mr Désir , I note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.
( The sitting was closed at 8.14 p.m. )
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Someone planted a car bomb and one person has died .
On behalf of my Group , I once again condemn these terrorist acts .
Thank you , Mrs Fraga Estévez .
We had heard about this regrettable incident .
( The Minutes were approved )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday , 21 January 2000 .
Madam President , allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cermis tragedy .
Mrs Angelilli , thank you . I have taken note of your comment .
The next item is the order of business .
Is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal ?
This debate is topical , exceptionally important and urgent .
We therefore believe that the agenda should be amended to include it .
( Applause )
Is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal ?
If you ratify ...
Mr Gollnisch , excuse me , you have one minute .
I know that you always take particular care to ensure that the Rules of Procedure are observed .
Madam President , I thought I had three minutes .
Do forgive me .
We have heard one speaker in favour and one against .
I shall now , therefore , put this proposal for an amendment to the agenda to the vote .
( Parliament gave its assent )
This debate is therefore added at the top of the order of business .
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
Talks in Austria on forming a government
I shall immediately give the floor to Mr Seixas da Costa , President-in-Office of the Council .
Let it be noted that we are completely united on all three counts .
I also believe that the Commission , or President Prodi , has acted as a guardian of the Treaties .
A government must have more nerve and more courage .
That is what I am asking President Prodi for at this moment .
( Applause )
Secondly , Madam President , we wish to send a very clear message to the Austrian people .
We should not be so politically partisan .
The accession of Austria to the Community was a joint venture .
We all took part in it , not just one group .
( Applause from the PSE Group )
Bilateral relations involve the States , so the 14 do not come into this .
However , we already knew this .
And these are the consequences !
Madam President , today we have an appointment with hypocrisy .
In the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach in Austria .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Are you going to interfere with Great Britain ' s Parliament if we are elected ?
Madame President , the people of Austria have spoken by electing Herr Haider to their Parliament .
I believe they gave him 28 % of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government .
Then , and only then , might you consider if human rights are affected .
The FPÖ party is established in Austria ' s political landscape .
Shame on you Mr Bertinotti !
Denouncing a democratically elected politician as a Nazi does not make you an anti-fascist !
That is why we are indebted to the Commission for taking a stance that separates it from the rest .
( The President cut the speaker off )
There will be a functioning majority and likewise a functioning opposition .
The ÖVP played no small part in helping Austria find its way into the European Union .
... , with all the rights and commitments that this entails !
( Applause )
( Applause , heckling )
They are trading this in for a head of government ' s position and for membership of a government .
... and that includes their representatives in this Parliament .
( Applause )
I urge you to support this Europe and to support and help this Austria !
( Applause )
Please support the Austrian people against this government !
( Applause )
It must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration .
We know that most Austrians respect these values .
They have also shown how they feel : not all the demonstrations have taken place outside Austria .
I believe Parliament should support these forces of democracy .
This danger does not concern Austria , it concerns Europe .
We are talking about us , not Austria .
The position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation .
This is the change we must impose on the Commission ' s action .
However , that is not the problem .
Our answer to this crucial question is no .
We agree with its substance , its tone and its scope .
( Applause )
History is a compendium of events which could have been avoided .
( Loud applause )
Let us learn the lessons of the past .
They put their own petty squabbles first , and the rest is history .
We must make a rapid , strong and united response .
So our response must be rapid and strong .
And when that day comes , it is too late .
We must therefore find a political solution .
Our response must be rapid .
This , Madam President , is the hypocrisy of the left .
We should recognise , however , that the democratic process sometimes produces uncomfortable results .
That should be our task , not political posturing .
Secondly , I want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evaluations .
We must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned .
That is why we are reacting against this carry-on in Austria .
It is not acceptable to continue as if nothing had happened .
We are at a watershed in the history of the European Union .
The European Union is in the process of finding its soul and getting some steel in its spine .
And this is not pure chance .
Well , we cannot accept such statements .
( Applause )
He also repudiates the basic forms of diplomatic politeness .
He is a dangerous man .
Values should take precedence over power .
We deplore , therefore , what is happening in Austria .
In fact , we were shaken by it .
We are extremely disappointed .
As a last resort , we would ask the ÖVP to look into alternatives .
We keep reminding them about Article 6 of the Treaty .
We continue to fight against the trivialisation of the extreme right .
Madam President , Austria awaits a heavy responsibility .
From all accounts , this would only serve to strengthen Haider .
Who would want this to happen ?
Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics ?
Europe is a community of law .
( Applause )
There is no complacency , no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all .
That surely is in everyone ' s interests .
We will continue to do that , Madam President , without fear or favour .
That is our duty .
It is also a matter of conviction .
My final point is this .
We understand the context of this essential debate .
And that is why we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning .
Does the Commission support the Council ?
Thank you , Commissioner Kinnock .
Thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
Recourse to the precautionary principle
The next item is the Commission statement on recourse to the precautionary principle .
The precautionary principle is not a new concept .
The essence of the precautionary principle is clear .
The basic aim of the communication is twofold .
It is therefore political by nature .
And they must be consistent with similar measures already taken .
All these elements have to apply cumulatively .
Mr President , Commissioner , thank you very much for your statement .
I have three short questions , the first being as follows .
Lastly , will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation ?
. Thank you very much , Dagmar Roth-Behrendt , for these questions .
Of course , this is shared by the whole Commission .
And , I am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle .
Needless to say , this accords science a great deal of power .
I would like to ask , what is , then , the definition of a recognised minority ?
How would you describe this ?
What establishes a recognised minority ?
If a political decision is involved , I would also like to ask : who takes this political decision ?
The Commission ?
The Council ?
And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this ?
What is the role of the scientific committees ?
What , also , will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up ?
Finally , will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent , public way ?
These are my three questions .
. Yes , Mr President , that is true .
Who will take the decision , who are the decision-makers ?
Well , that depends on who the legislators are .
This is part of risk management .
You have to see this as a tool for risk management .
You have to assess all that and evaluate the science .
Then you decide to take a measure or not , to take action or not .
It is about brominated flame retardants .
. ( SV ) Mr President , thank you very much , Mr Sjöstedt , for this question .
The issue of brominated flame retardants is an important one .
There may be a series of different measures which can be taken .
It ought not , therefore , to be immediately interpreted as a ban .
This issue is extremely topical .
You said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier .
Is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean ?
Will the Americans take the same view of this point as we do ?
I consider it to be a breakthrough that we succeeded in concluding this protocol .
I believe it will set the trend for future discussions concerning the precautionary principle .
It is , moreover , also accepted as an important and effective tool .
Mr President , I have two questions . I shall try to be very brief indeed .
The first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle .
My second question concerns the burden of proof .
I remember Margot Wallström being introduced as Commissioner in the Committee .
At that time , she was talking about the desire for a reversed burden of proof .
In other words , a product ' s manufacturer is to demonstrate whether or not the product is hazardous .
I want to know whether this also applies in the document which the Commission has presented now .
. ( SV ) Thank you , Mrs Schörling .
It is not , therefore , the case that one must begin with a cost-benefit analysis .
The second question concerns the reversed burden of proof .
It is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases .
Very well , it is a fungicide , it kills off mould .
In those circumstances , consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result .
I believe we can learn something from this .
Indeed you responded in kind , as I knew you would do .
I have good reason for asking this .
I am certain that we are going to have more conflicts , for example with the United States .
We should not be so naïve as to think otherwise .
This constitutes a good example , therefore .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
Let me also once more thank my co-rapporteur Mr Leinen for our excellent collaboration .
I will not repeat which ones , because everyone knows .
The European Council in Helsinki itself approved enlargement involving 13 new Member States .
In theory , we could have done so .
Therefore , the number of issues decided by a qualified majority will increase .
That it is what we are doing .
We will talk about this on another day .
Let us call them the first three subjects of the IGC .
They need a political deal .
In those circumstances it would be silly not to widen the agenda .
Nobody is asking for a Christmas tree .
There is time .
Remember the IGC that led to the Single European Act .
It lasted only five months .
The IGC that led to the enormous Maastricht Treaty lasted a year .
I am pleased to see that the Commission shares our view .
I think there are some gaps in what they have put forward .
That is all to the good .
One part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the Court .
Another is for the Union itself to sign up to the European Convention .
That is why we as a group are in favour of the Intergovernmental Conference .
That is why we need transparency .
There is another central issue relating to democracy that I would like to make clear reference to .
No , to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis facing the Union .
The poor turnout at the European elections really should have been warning enough for everyone .
There is one final issue I would like to raise .
Parliament ' s opinion expressly demands amendments to the Treaty in the area of economic policy .
It is all about creating a socially just Europe .
This is the message that Parliament is sending to the Council .
This message must be very clear ; this is how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow .
There is clearly a more ambitious goal .
Brussels knows best .
It is , of course , thoroughly Orwellian .
( The President cut the speaker off )
There is more to be said on that score .
However , there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side .
The overall plan failed to do justice to any of this .
There is another point I would just like to draw your attention to .
What it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice .
In my view , that is the most important issue this Intergovernmental Conference has to concentrate its energies on .
This is the crux of the matter .
Mr President , only a strengthened Europe can cope with enlargement .
Only a strengthened Europe is immune to political opportunists who exploit dissatisfaction .
That is why sweeping reforms are necessary and , hence , a widened IGC agenda .
The Finnish Presidency only listened to minimalist governments and , unfortunately , turned a deaf ear to this Parliament .
Portugal should not take a leaf out its predecessor ' s book .
In many ways , they share the same interests and the same insights .
Of all priorities , this one is the most pressing .
What is the Commission ' s verdict on this ?
A good dose of hypocrisy is needed to overlook our weakness today .
Because of the situation in Austria , this is a dark day for Europe .
The forthcoming enlargement of the Union is used as an argument for this .
I am convinced that this is an error of judgement .
In the majority of EU countries , there are now governments dominated by social democrats .
The resolution requires the European Parliament to have increased influence over the Intergovernmental Conference .
This is what is and was meant by the call for a European Constitution .
However , that is precisely what is happening .
This is a big task but it can be done .
So we are watching that entire point extremely carefully .
We look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents .
In any case , this emerges from the favourable schedule we decided upon .
We must use dialogue at every political level , including of course dialogue with the national parliaments .
The issues to be dealt with at this Intergovernmental Conference are exceptionally sensitive .
I will mention two point that may create tension .
One is the balance which has so far been maintained between large and small countries .
Europe is not , nor can it become a classic federal state .
The other area of conflict is more difficult .
This means that they must function more simply and more rapidly .
Possibilities for faster and more simple operation do exist .
Of course they do , but they are not unlimited .
I am , however , optimistic .
Mr President , the Intergovernmental Conference mandate needs to be widened .
The most important issue with regard to this is internal differentiation within the Union .
This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about .
May I particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this Parliament .
What will happen to a place like Scotland , which I represent here ?
It will become totally invisible !
A growing body of opinion in Scotland holds that view .
This time , however , it is true .
The question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not .
Will we enlarge with or without deep reform ?
The Council is consulting us and Parliament is giving its opinion .
We want an Intergovernmental Conference , but not this one .
Must there be an IGC ?
Of course there must , but not this type of Intergovernmental Conference .
We must clearly set firm objectives .
The functionalist approach is over , for better or for worse .
The functionalist approach has brought us to this point .
Have we achieved results ?
We know , I know myself , that the weeks we have before us will be useful to us .
However , these Council proceedings must be carefully prepared .
Finally , I should like to make three additional comments , quite briefly , Mr President .
Such dialogue between the national parliaments , the European Parliament and ourselves is extremely important .
Tomorrow , I shall be in London .
In a fortnight ' s time , I shall be in Berlin .
It will have to initiate these negotiations .
Concluding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully .
It can count on the partnership of the Commission over the next few months .
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
There is no doubt that we need a legislative act here .
This system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms .
I believe this system is also more suited to practical needs .
This would make our rapporteur ' s life considerably easier in the future .
There is also a proposed amendment to both of Mrs De Palacio ' s reports .
That is why he deserves special mention !
The Commission also supports the proposed flexible period of validity of the card .
That is why the Commission supports Mrs Palacio ' s Amendment No 22 in both respects .
These are a few introductory remarks concerning the key amendments .
I propose to confine my comments to two areas .
Neither outcome would be satisfactory .
Accordingly , the bureaucratic hurdles that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance .
Perhaps there was a certain amount of residual misunderstanding on the part of the Commission .
We want to achieve a completely flexible solution .
Allow me just to go very briefly into a second matter .
Most of those who have been working on the directive to date have been lawyers .
We are aware that this directive is founded on EC law and not on EU law .
We have expected the citizens to take on board the transition from EEC to EC to EU .
They have now got to grips with " EU " .
I would urge the Council and the Commission to move in this direction .
This directive is , of course , not in itself directly about that .
Nevertheless , I have tabled an amendment .
Mrs Berger , in your Amendment No 2 to Recital 6 , you mention legal security .
Legal security requires this .
There are already some ex ante controls laid down in article 4 of the directive .
It therefore makes no sense to maintain that legal insecurity .
Under the arrangements contained in the Treaties , the United Kingdom retains its border controls .
For that reason , we shall vote against both these proposals .
Why do I think we need the directive so much ?
There are approximately thirteen million third-country subjects who reside within European territory .
I have also paid close attention to the concerns raised by the Commissioner .
The other amendments are unacceptable .
Surely this is contrary to interests of public order within the Member States .
The Commission has the same opinion of similar amendments to the second proposal .
I would like to add that Amendment No 10 to that proposal is wholly acceptable .
I would now like to move on to Lord Inglewood ' s remark .
The question is , furthermore , one of whether the two cases should be treated in the same way .
I will keep myself free in this connection .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Bolkestein .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Court of First Instance
For this reason , I would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by Vice-President Marinho .
Behind these principles , Mr President , lies the justice system .
The working document prepared by the Court itself contains alarming information .
Since we are talking about the Intergovernmental Conference , let us consider just two points .
The first concerns this Parliament .
And I refer once again to the declarations which we have heard in recent days .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and welcome the contents of this report .
It has caused me to reflect on two problems which have come to me recently in my own constituency .
Both concern cases with decisions pending before the Court of Justice .
The decision could have huge implications for our local economy .
Amongst the statistics there is a worrying upward trend in the time taken to deal with preliminary references .
We need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind .
As things stand , OLAF is in a vacuum and can do as it pleases .
It is essential for OLAF to be monitored by a court .
The only court that could reasonably do so would be the Court of First Instance .
That would be another way of spurring the reform process on .
Mr President , I would like to begin by joining those who congratulated the rapporteur on this work .
The European Union is a system based on law .
It must therefore have a system of courts to enforce that law .
Certainly it is perceived de facto to be impossible .
The unease is justified .
It has been said more than once : justice delayed is justice denied .
The Commission sympathises with these considerations .
In the light of this sympathy , I would like to continue my response as follows .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
Exceptional financial aid to Kosovo
I have been informed that the rapporteur has been delayed for several minutes .
I propose that we start the debate immediately .
He will join us and speak as soon as he arrives .
An urgent request has been referred to us , and we approve it .
We have been asked for EUR 35 million .
We are talking about macrofinancial aid .
This is not our opinion .
The other parties are not paying .
We wish to see an end to this one-sided situation regarding requests for financial aid .
We would like the Commission to make commitments on the amendments we are proposing in regard to this .
When we come to pay , we want to know what the others are paying .
This is serious , since it holds up the whole process of reconstruction in Kosovo .
We have Commission documents which speak of firm commitments .
Kosovo has suffered far too much from delays in payment .
No one knows what kind of authority this parliament is going to have vis-à-vis UNMIK .
Administration-wise there are now 34 tax inspectors .
That is excellent news !
I believe that is a good thing
The EU Commission cannot pay for everything .
Mr President , I would like to offer a few explanations .
However , I would like to concentrate on two points .
Let us make this clear , however much some people may not wish to believe it .
However , this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process .
Only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions .
I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future .
However , we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here .
If the Alliance is still active in that region , it is with the same objective .
The Council ' s failings in this respect are a source of much regret .
What is to be done with this money ?
I would like to highlight the issue of human rights .
The West fought for human rights in Kosovo and what is happening there today ?
These are events and situations that cannot be tolerated .
There are , at the very least , rumours that Serbian militias are up to their old tricks again .
We need more police officers , as we have nowhere near enough .
All of this needs to happen , and quickly too .
I think I have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight ' s debate .
However , in moving forward , what should we be financing ?
This is the first point on which there is a certain amount of disagreement .
Is the Commission making an excessive effort while others are failing to cooperate ?
Some of the amendments in your report pose this question .
For example , Amendments Nos 1 , 2 and 4 .
Amendment No 4 is of a similar nature .
On this specific point , we can perhaps offer Mr Bourlanges greater satisfaction .
A third problem has been raised by Mrs Dührkop with regard to the multiannual programmes .
I would remind you that these projects are multiannual .
The programmes clearly have to take the annual budgetary contributions into account .
The Commission can commit itself to regularly informing Parliament of the invitations to tender which are published .
Commissioner , an agreement is an agreement .
No , Mr Bourlanges , I think it is a substantive problem .
The problem is how in practical terms to implement the compromise which we accepted .
With this , we believe that we are totally in line with what we agreed .
I agree , absolutely . We shall do so .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
The project has been long and problematic .
Although there is much that is good about the new directive , it is nonetheless not without its defects .
One example is the use of peat .
Peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels .
Research is particularly essential with regard also to the EU ' s next round of enlargement .
The EU must adhere to the Kyoto Protocol on climate .
We are all concerned about the environment and our children ' s future .
For that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate : nuclear energy .
I would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the Conciliation Committee , Mr Provan .
This is not satisfactory - I would like to make that quite clear .
This is the European Union ' s declared aim .
It contains plans for financial support for all the main renewable energy sources sectors .
The overall investment costs for this campaign are estimated to be approximately EUR 30 billion .
There is very little in the way of appropriations to meet these targets , however .
The main responsibility for increasing the use of renewables is to be borne by the Member States .
Promoting the use of renewables is especially important for the environment .
Renewable energy sources lower dependency on imported energy and their increased use boosts competitiveness .
May I also venture to raise the matter of peat ?
Peat is not mentioned in the list of renewable energy sources .
I hope that in the future it can be included in the list of renewables .
Mr President , may I commence by complimenting Mr Langen on his work .
In this regard , it must be remembered that energy policy remains within the national remit .
I would hope that the contribution of ALTENER would lead to more initiatives .
As the final text rightly states , actions such as these can play a role in reducing regional disparities .
ALTENER will make a valuable contribution to the combined efforts of the Member States .
In fact , renewable energies unquestionably provide a way of achieving these objectives .
I would also like to recognise the reasonable and flexible action of the Council .
I hope that you will all agree that this is important progress .
This was an important consideration for us .
Funding for energy saving still comes primarily from the Member States .
We have to bear that in mind when approving this programme .
We have an important part to play in the Community in the European Union in this regard .
SAVE is the only Community-wide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy .
It is something that we can all support .
We are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see .
If we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do .
I would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
For no one is very keen to spend money on culture .
Sadly that is the case and we must face facts .
What kind of horse-trading system is this ?
It is downright scandalous what goes on !
It is an awful sort of horse-trading , based on unequal positions !
Nevertheless , we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to .
It lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us .
It is my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of synergy with a little money .
It has once again been demonstrated that conciliation is incompatible with the demand for unanimity in the Council .
This demand makes conciliation almost impossible and even affects the dignity of the parliamentary institution .
It is also of great importance to citizens .
Today , we have arrived at the end of a long road .
Codecision and unanimity do not go hand in hand .
They are like a snake biting its own tail .
The result is 30 % growth , so we are not completely dissatisfied with the result .
I would like to stress that culture is not only funded from this particular pot .
So I myself will make sure that this aspect receives due attention .
I have always given the rapporteur my backing in this respect .
All that remains for me to say is : time to get down to business .
It is shameful !
That figure of EUR 167 million for so many years is a disgrace for the European Union !
We hope that this , at the least , will come about during the evaluation process .
Both of them have done a first-class job .
Why do I say that culture is important ?
Well in simple economic terms , Europe ' s culture adds to genuine prosperity .
Where would Europe ' s tourism industry be without the richness of our culture ?
But , more importantly than that , cultural activities are what make mankind civilised .
Cultural diversity is important , and it is under threat .
However , it is not under threat from Europe .
That is what Culture 2000 is about .
So , I say to the Council of Ministers : Keep this programme genuinely under review .
Are we doing enough ?
The framework programme on culture is replacing the present Kaleidoscope , Ariane and Raphael programmes .
Cultural activity creates identity .
We want a colourful Europe .
We want a Europe based on the principle of diversity within unity .
We want people to understand and learn to appreciate differences .
I would like to second what the previous speaker had to say .
In this way , the unanimity principle has shown itself to be a blockading instrument of the first order .
A pilot programme was called for to bridge the gap .
And so the moderate sum of 167 million will stand until 2004 .
There is a blatant discrepancy here !
Previous speakers have already kindly pointed this out .
Perhaps the Council will come to understand that cultural activities do the European Union good , not harm !
What , may I ask , is the Council afraid of ?
Man and culture are priorities , and culture can result in economic growth .
What does it mean and what does Europe give us over and above the parameters of our national boundaries ?
That is what Culture 2000 represents .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we have now come to the end of a long road .
They all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution .
This is going to lead us to make ' Culture 2000 ' the programme of the citizen .
This is what our European ' Culture 2000 ' programme offers .
It does not compete with the cultural policies implemented in the various Member States .
Such policies are necessary , and I would like to see them developed further .
Secondly , encouraging exchanges , mobility and training in the cultural sector .
Thirdly , promoting cooperation between cultural operators .
Thank you , Commissioner .
I think we can also thank the rapporteur once again .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
( The sitting was closed at 9.55 p.m. )
We therefore have a number of amendments .
I personally believe that the scope of the directive goes beyond its objective .
I do not think it is necessary for classic cars to be part of the directive .
I am not looking for such rigidly high recycling quotas when it comes to special-purpose vehicles either .
I want special-purpose vehicles such as ambulances to have high recovery quotas .
This is my main concern in this matter .
An important part of this directive is the issue of what to do with used parts .
What should we do with the shredded products ?
Of course we need to aim high , but quotas must not become an end in themselves .
This would at least mean 400 kg times 200,000 km less transportation .
We think they should .
May I say something about costs .
I can only warn you against consenting to this .
This too is a particular desire of my group .
This is why I propose splitting the costs between the first holder and the manufacturer .
As for a ban on certain materials : of course we need one !
A car has dangerous components which we must ban long-term .
This means that we need a pressure instrument .
The Commission has put forward various proposals which are too stringent and we have come up with some alternatives .
There are a number of sound amendments .
This Parliament has been given more authority , so let us use it !
Let us have the courage to put together a ground-breaking directive .
I ask for your support .
The principle of ' polluter pays ' is not being applied .
The only merit of this directive is that it looks to the future .
Neither is correct .
We simply must realise that the directive on the table is a sound directive .
All the same , there is one point on which we are in conflict .
It concerns the issue of recycling costs .
So who will pay for the vehicles which are to be disposed of ?
And what about vehicles which are already on the road ?
Mr President , Commissioner , I think we need this directive .
Firstly , because it clearly stipulates the environmental objectives .
Secondly , because it can promote recycling , which is important .
Thirdly , because it sets out a clear procedure to combat pollution caused by heavy metals .
This is also an important point .
Secondly , we need to retain the details as they are included in the common position .
As from 2006 , therefore , all vehicles should be handed in at no cost to their last owners .
Needless to say , this is most definitely an essential point which should not be changed in any way .
Is this too much of a burden ?
There is , however , one thing we should not overlook .
The directive applies to complete cars , that is to say cars with none of the essential components missing .
According to the experts , few of these complete cars are of no value .
This directive encourages the whole of this sector .
It is a sector which comprises small and medium-sized businesses .
I think , therefore , that vintage cars ought to be exempt .
Also , it is a good thing that we should clearly lay the burden of responsibility with the manufacturer .
That is a basic principle which we must uphold .
I find this a well-balanced formula which does not preclude a number of other things .
I think we need to retain it .
I would ask you to support this common position .
Mr President , we need to take an important decision today .
The common position stipulates 2006 .
This is ultimately cheaper , also for the consumer .
For twenty years , the majority within Parliament has attempted to make European environmental policy greener .
That is why I urge you to vote against Amendments Nos 38 and 45 .
We , the Green Group , by and large support the common position .
For ourselves , it is crucial that the following principles should apply .
The polluter should pay .
There must be rules governing existing vehicles too .
We shall vote against any amendments which run counter to these considerations .
I was myself a car worker before I was elected .
I think that very tough demands should be made of the car industry .
It is precisely this type of car industry which we should be encouraging in the European Union .
There is no doubt that abandoned cars represent a serious threat to the visual and physical environment .
Our citizens expect us in this regard to protect their interests .
We need to conduct a serious analysis of the matter .
Who pays for the collection , the dismantling , the disposal and so on ?
And should the directive be retrospective to cover every car that has ever been made ?
The proposal from the Council , the common position , is that manufacturers should pay the lot .
That cost would inevitably be passed on to the price and hence to the buyers of new cars .
Retrospective law is bad law , it is unfair law and often it is unworkable law .
That is why I have called for a roll-call vote on this .
But , as Mr Lange so rightly said , this solution is totally unfair to European car manufacturers .
The common position was more feasible since it envisaged 2006 for vehicles already on the road .
Mr President , the European Parliament is today facing an important decision .
The credibility of Parliament as a champion of environmental protection is at stake .
The intention of Florenz and Lange in their amendments is obvious : to sabotage the directive !
The proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation .
This is totally unacceptable .
Do not continue in this vein !
Start representing your people and not just your car manufacturers !
Mr President , this directive has been under discussion since 1997 .
It is high time that we reached an agreement .
Parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context .
The other question is who should bear the cost .
We are more in agreement with the amendment proposed at first reading .
I believe that this proposal relies on very long deadlines .
Mr President , today the European Parliament must face up to real responsibilities .
I can gauge its importance for my country ' s international reputation .
I am aware of the difficulties the Council experienced in finding a compromise .
That is why , today , we must be understanding alchemists , concerned for our environment .
This will either be the century of waste management or it will not .
Indeed it is accepting its responsibilities .
I am opposed to making the car owners liable .
Who is to pay for recycling the car I bought in France if I register it in Belgium ?
Which national fund will pay for my end-of-life vehicle ?
Every year , we discard a huge amount of cars which contain many dangerous substances .
This is why it is important to prevent waste materials .
What is left of the stripped vehicle also requires to be processed adequately .
These days , the complete dismantling of end-of-life vehicles is economically viable .
This means that we move away from shredding .
The processing cost can then be incorporated in the price of new cars .
The proposals made by a few MEPs impact greatly on this system .
The so-called shared liability is very cumbersome and does not stimulate innovation .
Finally , this directive should enter into force at the earliest opportunity .
A laborious conciliation procedure would entail an unnecessary delay , at the expense of the environment .
Mr President , I hold Mr Florenz in high esteem .
I would like to comment on two things . Firstly , vintage cars and motorbikes .
I do not wish to alter the text of the common position in any way .
In my opinion , there is too much initial hesitation .
The car lobby has led too many people up the garden path .
These costs are not very high .
In the Member State where I come from , you are talking about 150 Guilders per car .
I do not wish to make any changes to this particular aspect of the compromise .
We shall then be able to achieve an environmentally respectable result .
Now who should pay the costs ?
Do not be fooled by the car manufacturers !
If you want the full benefits of this directive use your vote to throw out these amendments .
It has become eminently political .
Yesterday we honoured our institution with a political debate .
We cannot accept this .
It would be a precedent which would open the door to all sorts of pressure in many other areas .
This is a useful measure and it is one which we all need .
Most of the technical issues have been resolved .
There are some details to be finalised but most of the technical issues have been resolved .
We have arrived at the final question .
They have paid already .
I cannot accept that .
There are amendments here today that are proposing that should be the case .
I cannot accept it and I will not vote for it .
The responsibility for these cars lies with the manufacturer .
The common position does not preclude the possibility of contributions being made by government .
The common position is a reasonable compromise .
It is disgraceful the way in which the German Presidency handled this matter .
For there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector .
The common position is also no great shakes from an environmental viewpoint .
The objections of the industry in this matter are certainly not without foundation .
That is why , in my opinion , the manufacturer must take the greatest share of the responsibility .
Mr President , there are two issues of principle in the Council ' s draft directive .
The first concerns the manufacturer ' s unrestricted liability to take back end-of-life vehicles .
There is the risk of creating a monopoly within the car dismantling trade .
Yet the trade in used car parts is important , especially for those who collect and renovate older vehicles .
They should be able to establish themselves in new markets , but also to leave old markets .
The second principle in the Council ' s common position is the retroactive element in the draft directive .
To do so also changes the owner ' s liability retroactively .
Over the years , a consumer may have altered the product in a number of ways .
Some may be better than others , and some worse .
This does not conflict with a financing model involving the building up of funds .
Mr President , this is an extremely bad directive .
It is far too prescriptive .
It sets in stone one particular model of recycling .
This is a very environmentally reasonable approach .
The Social-Democratic Group has submitted a few important proposals for improvement over the past couple of days .
Consequently , consideration will also be given to recycling during the conception phase and production .
This is a big problem in my opinion .
They would then determine their own prices .
I would therefore appreciate your support for Amendment No 45 .
This is financed by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contributes .
Should this be condemned ecologically , Frau Breyer ?
I do not think so .
( Applause from the PSE Group )
We have reached an agreement with all the parties involved .
An environmental policy agreement has been signed on a voluntary basis .
Belgians can deliver their cars back to the vendor without any cost .
I am in favour of collection free of charge .
It worked for us .
Why would it not work elsewhere ?
Would you be so kind as to bear with me for a few minutes .
Allow me briefly to comment on some of the assumptions and principles behind the present directive .
Moreover , they constitute environmentally hazardous substances of the worst kind .
Cars are one of the fastest growing sources of waste we have in Europe .
Secondly , we want to establish the fact that the manufacturer is liable .
We should see to it that we recycle as much as possible of the various contents of a product .
Thirdly , we wish to achieve the recycling objectives specified in the present directive .
These are the three most important aims of the directive .
First of all : who should pay ?
And secondly : are we reducing the European car industry ' s competitiveness by means of the present proposal ?
The first question , then , is about who should pay .
It is nonetheless clear that the cost will be borne jointly by manufacturers and consumers .
Do we imagine , then , that the cost would disappear if we were not to adopt this directive ?
Moreover , the cost will have to be borne in the future .
Are we therefore talking about a car industry in crisis ?
Is it the case that the car industry definitely cannot afford these ?
No , of course not .
It is quite the opposite .
The cost is not insurmountable ; nor is the task an impossible one .
The industry itself will ensure that these systems are introduced in Europe .
They will not represent an insurmountable cost for the European car industry .
We must do this for the sake of the environment .
The costs will not disappear . Nor will the waste disappear .
That is what I should like to say by way of introduction .
I also want to comment on the question as to whether there is to be any retroactive legislation .
It is still not an insurmountable problem .
We can deal with it .
We already have an infrastructure .
We have what we require in order to deal with end-of-life cars .
I naturally hope that the result of today ' s vote will be a good one .
I believe it will have very positive and noticeable effects on the environment .
We cannot continue to close our eyes to these matters .
As I have said , we have both the knowledge and the resources to cope with these issues .
However , we obtained a well-balanced common position in July during the Finnish Presidency .
Now , we must ensure that the present legislative process is concluded successfully .
A total of 48 amendments have been tabled .
The Commission can adopt 10 amendments in their entirety .
Three amendments can be partially approved , and one can be approved in principle .
These amendments can all be approved .
Amendments Nos 6 and 21 are new ; the Commission can approve these .
The Commission can also approve Amendment No 26 with certain editorial changes .
They cannot therefore be approved .
Parliament has traditionally made a major contribution to strengthening environmental legislation in Europe .
It would amaze and depress me if it were not to do so today .
I want to deal with these amendments on a group-by-group basis .
Amendment No 12 involves a delay of at least ten years in bringing the provision into force .
This would mean that the process of replacing dangerous substances would be implemented more slowly .
The compromise reached by the Council is fair but fragile .
This does not impose disproportionate costs upon manufacturers . Far from it .
Amendments Nos 39 , 40 , 46 and 47 concern quantified objectives .
These amendments would also make the objectives awkward to deal with and difficult to supervise .
We do not consider that Amendments Nos 2 and 14 add anything to the directive .
Amendment No 23 involves the Commission ' s having to adopt quality standards for reusable components .
This is not covered by the directive .
An ad hoc directive should therefore be demanded from the European Parliament and the Council .
Amendments Nos 29 , 31 and 41 water down the requirements concerning the dismantling of vehicles .
Furthermore , Amendment No 43 does not fall within the directive ' s area of applicability .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
There is an error which has still not been corrected and that is on Amendment No 4 .
In the English version we refer to pharmaceutical and scientific organisations .
In the French version that becomes ' entreprises pharmaceutiques et organisations scientifiques ' .
It should not be in the amendment .
I shall consult the parliamentary services to see how we can find a solution .

Joint motion for a resolution on the negotiations to form a government in Austria
Madam President , we simply have a few translation problems in this area too .
We consider the English version to be the original text .
This is why I would ask you to consider the English version as the original version .
Thank you , Mr van Velzen .
In response I shall say the same thing I said to Mrs McNally just now .
In any case , the authoritative version is always , of course , the original language version .
Madam President , the Socialist Group proposes the following oral amendment .
I shall read it in English , which is the original language of the resolution .
( More than twelve Members of Parliament rise to their feet ) ( Parliament adopted the resolution )
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
McNally Report ( A5-0082 / 1999 )
This objective deserves our total support .
It is unacceptable for women to continue to be underrepresented .
I am therefore delighted to see the proposals of the European Commission .
Improved analysis of the obstacles facing women will make it possible to develop a strategy to eliminate those obstacles .
This is very good , and we are pleased to see it .
The fact is there are too few women involved in research work in the European Union .
This is patently not the case , since such a quota would not be realistic .
Indeed the report does not mention the time limit for this quota to be achieved .
It is not a quota !
People must realise this !
Second reading of the Florenz report ( A5-0006 / 2000 )
This cannot be a good thing in a European Union where we are ever mindful of employment .
In my opinion , this directive is unacceptable for this reason .
Madam President , I would like to comment on the Florenz report .
Here , unfortunately , the European Parliament has bowed to the interests of industry .
These splendid cars do not constitute waste .
That is why I voted in favour of the amendments .
In this way vehicles of historic value can be preserved for future generations .
They are involved in low-profile work of valuable cultural importance .
- ( SV ) The parliamentary process concerning this question has been confusing , to say the least .
We need a directive in this area , and we also therefore want to avoid a complicated conciliation procedure .
The directive concerning end-of-life vehicles will stand as an example for future legislation .
There are , however , two considerations which must certainly be dealt with within this text .
First of all , who is to bear the financial costs of this destruction ?
So let us vote for these amendments in order to preserve these gems of the automobile industry .
I only need to mention the case of Directives 79 / 409 and 92 / 43 .
On the contrary , we must adopt crystal-clear texts in order to limit legal disputes .
The car lobby was unsuccessful today and I am pleased about that .
The directive remains in place .
- My party opposed this measure and the proposed amendments .
Berger Report ( A5-0007 / 2000 )
Berger Report ( A5-0007 / 2000 ) and Berger Report ( A5-0012 / 2000 )
The second proposal grants the same rights to self-employed workers who are third country nationals .
That is why I am voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur .
This will make it possible to clarify the terms and thus prevent any misreading !
This goes against the fundamental principle of non-discrimination enshrined in the founding treaties of this Union .
Marinho Report ( A5-0003 / 2000 ) :
We have serious reservations about the Council ' s proposed amendments .
The first measure would in fact cancel out the effects of the latter .
So what was done at Amsterdam ?
Is the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference not the ideal opportunity for this ?
Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen Report ( A5-0018 / 2000 )
If they yield , they are lost .
An unduly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk delaying the enlargement process .
Once again the discussion is going to be monopolised by the Heads of State and Government .
Social Europe , used as a foil by the EU , has simply been eliminated from the agenda .
This is why I am voting against the report .
- The European Parliamentary Labour Party has abstained on the final vote on the Leinen Dimitrakopoulos Report .
Expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaties would bring with it a risk of de-stabilisation .
Our priorities ( i.e. the " left-overs " ) must be :
the number and responsibilities of Commissioners
weighting of votes in the Council
Joint resolution on Austria
Is this hysteria spontaneous ?
Who is imposing their will on the nations of Europe , daring to stop them choosing their own fate ?
Underground networks ?
The government of the United States , or of Israel ?
( The President cut the speaker off )
Madam President , I had a major problem with this resolution .
Finally , I abstained on the vote for a number of reasons .
However , I do wonder about the wisdom of this .
Even America has now said that it is considering breaking off diplomatic relations .
I really think that people should be extremely cautious .
We need to look at the people who vote for these parties , and understand why this situation arises .
I passionately defend Europe ' s heritage of human rights and the rule of law .
This is not the way to fight extremism .
It may even be a way of doing extremism a great deal of good .
What are we actually seeking to achieve in embarking on an Intergovernmental Conference ?
A Europe of 27 States or a Europe of 14 , or even fewer ?
This needs to be said !
Some have said it is not right for us to interfere in Austrian politics .
They are wrong .
European Union Treaties make it incumbent on us to protect fundamental rights .
Some have said we have to accept the results of democratic elections .
However , democratic elections do not make democrats of those who have threatened democracy .
However , we should not condemn Mr Haider for ambition .
Leopards do not change their spots .
These are the values which we ask of others who seek to join us .
I am proud to support such a resolution .
I shall take the floor very briefly , Madam President .
I do not believe that these signals will change the citizens ' indifference to Europe .
The Austrian extreme right has been gifted an unwarranted present .
They will not weaken Mr Haider and the FPÖ . On the contrary , they will strengthen them .
We shall obtain the very opposite of what we want .
That is not how you combat racism and a swing to the right .
This week we heard the first political cry of the new-born Europe .
The European Parliament was the first to speak up .
This courageous stance turns a new page in the construction of Europe .
Europe has managed to stand up to condemn unacceptable events .
Fascism and neo-Nazism are cancers !
The foul monster has been reawakened !
Europe was born out of a desire for peace , freedom and tolerance .
There is no question of it allowing xenophobic , racist and anti-Semitic ministers to be tolerated at within it .
Do not count on me to keep quiet , without doing or saying anything .
Such a concern is misplaced .
We have condemned Basque and Irish terrorism .
We have opposed racism and the infringement of the rights of minorities .
Such a view is not only a political cop-out , it is positively dangerous .
- ( DE ) I am making this statement on behalf of the CSU .
It is intolerable that the EU should involve itself in the formation of the government in a Member State .
It has no right to do so .
This does not mean that we sympathise with Haider .
The CSU European delegates have no sympathy whatsoever with the leader of the FPÖ .
For these reasons the CSU European delegates are against this resolution .
In this light , the events we are seeing in Austria must be seen as tragic .
The EU must not do him an invaluable PR service .
This is a smear on the voters in my neighbouring country which I cannot condone .
Today the republicans are no longer represented in most local parliaments .
The German approach is no guarantee that this radical movement will not grow again .
It cannot be copied arbitrarily since each Member State has its own specific conditions .
Sound democracy means being alert and not blind in one eye .
We must take up a reasoned offensive against radicals on both the right and the left .
In the meantime , they have been forming governments in German federal states .
I fully support the statements made by Commissioner Prodi in today 's session .
- ( FR ) I voted against the joint resolution on the situation in Austria .
Austria is a free , independent and sovereign country .
The Austrian elections were held in a free , proper and democratic manner .
Nothing of this nature has yet occurred in Austria .
In such circumstances will it even be worth having elections ?
I urge the Council and the Council Presidency to continue to protect the fundamental values of the Union .
I urge the Commission to be less cautious .
In this resolution , Parliament is assuming its responsibilities .
The Austrian People ' s Party must accept some historical responsibility for this .
We must reject what is unacceptable , as our constituents demand .
I abstained in the vote on adopting the resolution .
I condemn Jörg Haider ' s racist and xenophobic policy .
The treaties do not authorise this reaction by the 14 Member States .
That concludes the vote .
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
( The sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m. )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 3 February 2000 .
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the sitting on Thursday 3 February have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
I shall therefore postpone the approval of the Minutes .
Madam President , on a point of order .
Thank you , Mr Davies .
I shall look into this matter with the College of Quaestors .
Madam President , on a point of order .
Happy Valentine ' s Day !
Thank you , Mr Murphy .
Madam President , on a point of order .
I wonder on what point of order Mr Davies was speaking .
They will look into the matter thoroughly .
Thank you , Mr Wurtz .
I was promised back in September that there would be a Dutch channel by January .
It is now February and we are still waiting .
I would ask you once again to work on this .
If it is of any comfort to her , the Irish have not got their channel yet either .
There seem to be intractable technical problems but we are definitely working on it .
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this .
a ) Sittings from 14 to 18 February 2000 in Strasbourg Relating to Wednesday :
Is there anyone who wishes to speak on behalf of these groups in favour of this proposal ?
Since no one wishes to speak , I shall put this proposal to the vote .
( Parliament gave its assent ) Relating to Thursday :
According to the list given in the final version of the agenda , there are already four items .
We can therefore table only one additional item .
We are in favour of the International Criminal Court , but it does not yet exist .
( Parliament rejected the proposal ) President .
Is there a Member who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal ?
( Parliament gave its assent ) President .
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PPE in favour of this proposal ?
We have tried to drive this proposal through .
I should therefore be very grateful indeed if the Chamber could support it .
( Parliament gave its assent )
Relating to Friday : President .
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PSE Group in favour of this proposal ?
We already have a directive .
It is not an old one , it was issued in 1997 .
We had reached this agreement on principle in the Conference of Presidents .
That is why I should like to support the Social Democrats ' request to hold the vote on Friday .
( Parliament gave its assent )
On Friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda .
That is absolutely absurd .
This is all I am talking about here , just that .
I understand that there is agreement on this issue .
These are serious allegations .
They are completely untrue , malicious , politically biased and were broadcast in the full knowledge of their falsehood .
We are taking legal advice .
My colleagues ' register of interests is complete .
Quite , we agree absolutely .
b ) Sittings of 1 and 2 March 2000 in Brussels
Sustainable urban development - rural development - EQUAL initiative
This programme constitutes a driving force for development on the European scale .
The adoption procedure for the programmes is established by the general regulations on Structural Funds .
Nevertheless , technical assistance is necessary .
I have endeavoured to secure the widest possible support for the report .
A compromise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers .
EQUAL should live up to its name , and this is my firm intention .
It should provide equal opportunities for all those at a disadvantage in the European Union .
It should prevent society from splintering .
It should prevent exclusion from being part of everyday life .
Urban policy has always been at the forefront of EU policy .
In committee we are not in favour of reducing the number to 50 .
This needs to be acknowledged as a tool and resource in addition to the EU criteria .
I would ask you to take on board local indicators to help us do that .
Often these problems are compounded by poor health and housing stock and a culture of drug dependency .
This is all too familiar in many of our urban areas .
The Community initiative means community involvement .
We need to encourage them to participate in designing and delivering projects for these programmes .
The time-scale therefore proposed by the Commission is very ambitious .
This is important in the interests of transparency and the overall effectiveness of networks .
For this reason we very much welcome programmes of this kind .
These objectives are obviously intended to make employees as useful and usable as possible to the economy .
Nevertheless the Conservatives voted against this in the committee .
I would ask them the following questions : does your policy seek to marginalise people ?
This is a good approach and that is why we have also supported it .
However , criticism has been voiced within my group over the timing of the preparatory work of the committee .
Our group is reviewing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee .
This is such an important matter for consideration that firm conclusions have to drawn .
The regulation pretends that there is one , but there is not .
Nothing has happened !
The difficulties are once again being allowed to persist , to the detriment of the regions concerned .
We want a Europe for the people and not a Europe of paper-pushers !
That is a question of solidarity and progress .
The local councils and regions where the money ends up have since gained practical experience .
The discussion has centred on the allocation formula to be applied .
Mr President , quite a few towns and cities within the European Union have to contend with deprivation .
The Member States do not always have sufficient means at their disposal to address this deprivation adequately .
In common with Mrs McCarthy , I have to note that the number of areas has been drastically reduced .
Consequently , we cannot support Amendment No 2 of the Greens , as borne out in the committee meeting .
Structural support is said to cause subsidy-dependence .
We would then be overreaching ourselves .
I would like to finish off by making a general comment on INTERREG .
When projects are implemented , it is also important that they do not contravene general Community legislation .
Hence our amendment in order to prevent contradictions between general policy and actual projects .
I welcome the continuation of INTERREG and the priority which it has been accorded .
However , the delayed presentation of the draft guidelines has caused a number of problems .
That is a shame because it threatens perfectly sensible projects .
LEADER must now move into the implementation phase .
Five months are provided for this .
That seems to me to be rather too long .
Efforts should be made here to achieve shorter times .
For me this raises the following questions : who will work there ?
How will these people be selected ?
Where , above all , will the required money come from , and where should this observatory be located ?
There must not be any repetition of cases of parallel projects on both sides of a border .
This , unfortunately , is not the case in Ireland .
The development partnerships are a very clever idea , even though they are experimental .
I have two major concerns , however , about the development partnerships .
We need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme .
Projects should also specifically address this problem .
These concerns must be looked at while setting up the programmes .
I now turn to the controversial issue of asylum-seekers and refugees .
So , the concept for LEADER + should retain all the positive aspects of previous programmes .
Are there so many other European schemes which can boast 800 specific original experiments which were particularly successful ?
Mr President , I have a few very brief comments .
The Community initiatives we are debating could play a positive part subject to certain preconditions .
Our response to rural decline has come late in the day , but I suppose better late than never .
In my view the next five years will decide the future of thousands of marginal family farms .
It behoves all of us to do everything possible to ensure their survival .
In this regard LEADER has established itself as an effective development initiative .
The voluntary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully appreciated .
I urge you to look seriously at this problem .
This is an arduous task .
Only , the number of people affected by these programmes has not really dropped .
Comments are made here and there to the effect that one group should get more funding than another .
This is not the case !
It has to be redistributed time and again .
That is not the intention and that is an important point that we need to bear in mind here .
I believe that this is actually a good thing .
The position of Parliament in this whole procedure is somewhat unclear .
And neither should we create structures which are reliant on subsidies and which will be dependent on them forevermore .
The investment needs to be visionary .
Last week , we had a very impassioned discussion about the formation of the Austrian Government .
I hope that the Chamber will be just as committed this time .
The European Union contributes 75 % of the Peace and Reconciliation programme .
That time is now past .
This increased awareness does not , however , affect identity alone .
It is fostered by a fair appraisal of our assets .
I understand the Commission ' s own concern that distance may prove detrimental to effective cooperation .
Nonetheless , there are many maritime areas between which links are already established .
Various local authorities around the North Sea provide a prime example of this .
INTERREG could well allow enhancement of such cooperation .
I hope for their adoption .
There is a lot of expertise within the relevant organisations which deserves to be shared .
My group will not be supporting those amendments .
Of course , every instance of a deprived urban area is a separate case .
I would wish URBAN to be orientated mainly towards providing answers to those causes of urban deprivation .
Unfortunately , it is necessary to point out again that we do not have equality .
A breakthrough in this regard may perhaps lead to changes in other areas , however .
If that is the case , we have not progressed one little bit since pagan times .
Unfortunately , developments are not moving in that direction .
On the contrary .
One can only hope that it succeeds .
There is a problem , however , which we need to address together .
Of course this is also the basic idea .
Have faith in the successful results which LEADER has had so far .
That was the charm of LEADER , and that should please not be lost !
My group will be supporting Amendment No. 22 .
It is interesting to note that all rural areas may be eligible for LEADER II .
Like the rapporteur , we deplore the fact that it has been excluded from strand IIIA .
I hope that the Commissioner will accept the proposal which we are making .
I believe that we should be pleased about this .
Its argument was one of priority .
The urban dimension must be incorporated much more deeply in all the structural funds .
Disabled people have too often been left off the list .
Finally , a word on INTERREG .
There is no change in refugee policy in Austria !
I should like to welcome in particular the new LEADER + programme because of its comprehensive nature .
The Commission would have abolished URBAN , but this time Parliament drew the longer straw .
It is good that URBAN is to continue , as it has had good results at local level .
There is an immense risk of exclusion .
In many cities in France and England there are now slums , breeding grounds for many sorts of problems .
None of us wants South American type favelas in Europe .
We have to act now , before it is too late .
Our cities are also of decisive importance for Europe ' s economy .
This is not policy ; it is life ' s simple logic .
Our attention is no longer focused exclusively on internal borders but also on external ones .
That is a reduction of 3 ¾ % compared with the previous CIs .
How are priorities supposed to be set here ?
Transnational strategies are intended to make it possible for disadvantaged groups to have access to jobs .
This proposal will remove the current budget line B2-5122 and create a new budget heading B1-382 .
Informing and training young farmers at European level is vitally important .
But the Commission is now proposing that training should no longer be included .
Therefore I am putting forward three amendments .
I would urge Parliament to support them .
These people live in areas which should benefit from these projects .
I think however that you will all recognise your own comments .
I can understand your concern .
That is my initial response to the threshold question .
This cannot , however , be grounds for an extension of the original time limit .
Let me remind you that the time limit for this programme is six months .
With regard to URBAN , I should like to conclude with a final observation .
One of you expressed a wish that these urban issues should not be confined to the URBAN initiative .
I agree completely .
The first relate to the timetable and the content of this initiative .
There is a delay in adopting the INTERREG guidelines in March or April 2000 .
I accept this ; I take note of it as you do .
So much for the first comment .
Fourth observation : the European Observatory and the possible use of a technical assistance office .
Another point : the coordination between INTERREG , PHARE , TACIS and MEDA .
The Commission must continue along these lines .
I am making a personal commitment to do so .
The Commission attaches the greatest importance to this , just as you yourselves do .
So we are working within this framework and not outside it .
I should also like to remind you that the idea of setting up an observatory is nothing new .
There was also an observatory under LEADER I and LEADER II .
The cost of this observatory is not permitted to exceed 2 % of the LEADER budget .
I now come to the content of the report .
We will obviously do this and will also forward a report to you on it .
In point 18 , Parliament suggests publishing a compendium of examples of successful initiatives .
In response I can only say that this already exists .
I can only fully share your concern .
Finally , under point 20 the motion for a resolution contains seven specific proposals for amendments to the guidelines .
That therefore leaves only the amendment proposed under paragraph 3 .
It will also continue to fight for Member States ' acceptance of this .
I will comment briefly on the 13 amendments tabled .
It can accept all of the others either in full or in essence .
It is worth stressing that both Parliament and the Commission must put forward specific policies .
I now come to the EQUAL initiative , which is , of course , based on Article 13 .
I have classified the issues raised by the honourable Members into four groups .
Firstly , the enlargement of the thematic areas .
The second subject is flexibility and simplification .
Finally , I would like to mention technical assistance .
We are trying to arrange that there will be four categories for which funding is available .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon .
( The sitting was closed at 8.40 p.m. )
Approval of the Minutes of the two previous sittings
The Minutes of the sittings of Thursday 3 February and Monday 14 February have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
( The Minutes were approved )
Thank you , Mr Medina Ortega .
I too wholeheartedly regret this situation .
Madam President , I had the same experience as Mr Medina Ortega yesterday .
Absolutely , Mr Napolitano . Thank you .
Thank you , Mr Lannoye .
I have received your letter and have already contacted the British Permanent Representative .
I have a lot of sympathy with that protest .
I have also been arrested for protesting at Faslane .
I did not hide behind any immunity .
I took the punishment that came to me .
Mrs Lucas should do the same .
Does anyone want to speak against Mrs Stenzel ' s request , as supported by Mrs Ghilardotti ?
If not , then we will proceed to the vote .
( Parliament approved the request )
Mr Corbett , I have not received any notification .
Madam President , I am amazed at Mr Corbett ' s reaction .
We are solidly with our Austrian friends who have proven to be good Europeans in the past .
They have our full support .
( Applause )
( Parliament gave its assent )
Commission 's strategic objectives and legislative programme
I therefore immediately give the floor to the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi .
I am referring to the sixteenth century when the discovery of America turned everything upside down .
Some of you may find it lacks detail , but no political structure sets out detailed five-year programmes .
This is the European Union , not the Soviet Union .
These will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years .
It will not be a philosophical Paper , but a practical Paper , full of focused proposals .
This is the new element that we must help to bring to the Balkans .
We must increase our efficiency in this area . We must reopen the Danube to boats .
If we do not do this , we shall have failed in our duty .
This is what we need to do for the Balkans .
There will be friendship , calm , openness but also a certain strictness in the enlargement process .
Our responsibilities do not stop at enlargement , or at the Balkans .
Some people have criticised me over the congratulatory message I sent to Chancellor Schüssel .
Last November , the Commission tabled a proposal for an anti-racism directive .
The forthcoming Lisbon Summit on these issues - dissemination of technology , employment - will be a decisive summit .
It has taken four years for us to be in a position to hold a summit of this kind .
We are at last holding it and cannot let this opportunity slip through our fingers .
Finally , our last commitment is to improve quality of life .
All too often we find ourselves calling for this after a disaster has occurred .
I think it would be appropriate to begin thinking about these things before disasters happen .
How will we judge , ladies and gentlemen , Madam President , the five years of our mandate ?
How are we going to assess the results of these five years ?
Let us take a very simple parameter : turnout at the next European elections .
We also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document .
I say that in all earnestness and I have chosen my words carefully .
We in the European Union are one Community .
We belong together , even when there are problems .
You have seen yourself as the guardian of the Treaties , and that is indeed your role .
( Applause )
Negotiations with six central European countries are starting today , bringing the European family a step closer together .
We agree with what you said about the Barcelona process .
We therefore take the uncompromising view that we must maintain a resolute and consistent stability pact .
We need structural reforms in the European economy .
We too want to help put Europe on its feet .
You spoke in your paper of decentralisation and subsidiarity .
We support that .
The nations , regions , towns and communities of Europe will be preserved .
If you are persuasive in your actions , we all reap the benefits .
( Applause )
We are breaking new ground and doing so in complex circumstances .
What we need here is good government , Madam President .
I have absolutely no doubt about this and I believe it is an essential point .
There can be no democracy without a living parliament .
I believe that this is the first objective for us to pursue .
Does the Commission think that there will be never be any revision ?
The issue of taxation also seems to us to be absolutely essential .
With regard to governance in general , I believe it might be worth thinking in theoretical terms .
I would be clearly in favour of subsidiarity .
In all other areas , I believe that subsidiarity is also relevant to this discussion .
They are political because we are moving on .
The challenge of enlargement is political .
The challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy is very political .
Because it is political it is more complex .
The means of achieving this are difficult but they are real .
We need more dialogue , not just with each other but also with civil society .
We need more explanation of what Europe is about .
We see enlargement as a positive sum gain for member and candidate states .
We need to be able to prepare that ground carefully .
We applaud the stabilisation and association agreements , but we would like to see more .
The strategic paper emphasises the global role of the European Union .
We need to open that debate .
I do not know whether you are a romantic or not , Mr Prodi .
Perhaps this is a very unromantic thing to say on such a morning .
That is the way it should be .
You gave consideration to important questions of principle in your programme .
As in any other party manifesto , it is full of contradictions .
I would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them .
First let me speak about the economy and social development .
Do please raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference .
In this respect , Parliament will definitely defend , along with yourselves , the importance of supranational decision-making .
One contradiction within your programme relates to globalisation .
You must embark on a dialogue with the international community .
Do please try to make the international organisations democratic .
We can submit motions for this together with you .
You ought to also be able to draw conclusions at the IGC .
We have to table motions proposing that our citizens might really have a direct impact on decision-making .
The main merit of the text of this communication is therefore the fact that it exists .
There are plenty of areas for serious discussion .
The perfect illustration of this crippling flaw lies in the opening sentence of the Commission communication .
A more balanced and more rigorous diagnosis would be welcome in my view .
My second criticism follows on from the first .
But all is not lost .
My group is fully intent on helping with this work .
This is a scenario whereby the European Union has a membership of over 25 Member States .
I do not want to see a two-tier European Union built .
Any future reforms of the European Union treaties will require a referendum to be held in my country .
I support the enlargement of the European Union .
Madam President , I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radical Members .
What do we expect from a government in any case ?
In any case , we shall see what specific steps transpire when the time comes for practical action .
Mr Prodi , I repeat that this is , in our opinion , a slightly short-sighted view .
I remember your predecessor ' s speech five years ago .
You talk about decentralisation but practise centralisation .
Local politicians cannot do that , once legislation has been passed in Brussels .
Even by this stage , that is already too many by far .
What he envisaged was what he called a small , practical secretariat .
That is not what Mr Prodi is President of today .
We need to match this vision with reality .
Here there are three elements I would like to contribute .
Firstly , we need a successful European economy .
We will be looking at this closely when we come to the annual programmes of proposed legislation .
Lastly , we need to ensure that there is proper , genuine reform of the European Commission .
The Commission is not in fact today a European government .
The Commission does not reflect the majority in this particular Parliament .
I fully endorse the philosophy and the principles behind these decisions .
That does not apply to Austria alone .
When it comes down to it , Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty are not enough .
I would also like to say a few words on Africa , Madam President .
One final remark regarding the Internet and globalisation .
But why do they not buy their own entrance ticket ?
The ensuing document is both ambitious and bombastic .
Is it not rather melodramatic to say that " the world looks up to Europe " ?
I am particularly intrigued by how the Commission considers bringing this about .
So who is this then ?
The Commission as a whole , its President perhaps , the Council ?
We could not agree more with the latter .
The document mentions common values on different occasions .
Unfortunately , I find the reference to the relevant standards to be lacking .
This raises the question as to what these standards and values are based on .
In the tradition of our continent , this realisation is an important one which merits recognition .
Have you already included your second term of office ?
But seriously .
First , streamlining .
The activities of the entire Union must be reduced to core areas of policy .
Secondly , the new " in " word is flexibility .
We must hold fast to joint decision-making institutions which embrace the Member States .
That also applies to the inclusion of the civil society , which is a welcome step .
( Applause )
That is transparency .
Thirdly , the European Union cannot and should not enlarge endlessly .
( Applause )
( Applause )
It is clear that the subject of the internal differentiation of the Union will be raised at the IGC .
The subject needs to be discussed without prejudice .
It raises expectations , but it can also lead to disappointment .
The enlargement of the Union is inspired by our wish for peace , security and stability .
You are looking to reassure the acceding countries , as well as European opinion .
But these days , we are witnessing the exact reverse before our very eyes .
Regions which , culturally and economically , sometimes match the interest of some Member States .
This is what the Commission will be judged on .
These ambiguities mask many misunderstandings , primarily about our values .
It is not enough to claim to adhere to democracy in order to be a democrat .
This Charter is really misnamed because it will actually reduce these rights .
In the Union for a Europe of Nations Group our principles are rather different .
Clearly we want to defend the countries of Europe but we also want to respect the autonomy of nations .
This is not impossible .
Clearly , they have no role to play in your strategy .
Your Commissioners are clearly not solely responsible for this .
The governments which , through spinelessness or ideology , support you are also responsible .
Brussels is not all of us , as you claim . It is all of you .
Tell the truth for once . You could not care less what the people of Europe want .
They are free to choose only between your brave new world and denouncement .
We were among the small number who denounced the communist dictatorship .
( Limited applause )
Mr President , public institutions must not accept only the economic criterion .
Our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart .
The first concerns women , gender and women 's rights .
What other explanation could there be for omitting women ?
The EU must not take on a masculine persona .
I would merely ask when this is likely to take effect .
It is a question of objectives that must be pursued as a priority .
Without these prospects that we have outlined , Europe would , once again , have no future .
This event must underpin enlargement .
In essence this means applying the principle of subsidiarity .
However , saying is one thing and doing is another !
I will therefore judge you on your deeds .
In the meantime , I approve and encourage this clearly expressed desire in your communication .
However , I must make two essential points . These concern the simplification and application of Community law .
Recent events have shown us that these regulations are essential .
Community law must not go unapplied because it is too complex or too pedantic .
Nevertheless , I regret that a clear alternative has not been proposed .
Finally , you do highlight European research as being at the heart of our future .
Yet you do not indicate the resources you intend to implement to achieve this .
Also , ethical principles are at the heart of this research but your communication says nothing about these .
I welcome you and your ambition .
Ambition will be needed , given the mammoth task which awaits us .
We have 1.27 % of the Community ' s GDP .
Not a euro more or a euro less .
It will not be us who refuse these new resources . You should ask the Council .
These financial perspectives are adjusted to within a millimetre .
The political priorities must be set by this House and the MEPs .
We therefore wonder whether the Commission has the political will to resolve them .
On one hand , there are the words and , on the other , their real political meaning .
We Socialists applaud the Commission for wanting to fight against social exclusion and poverty .
Yet how can the gulf between political rhetoric and reality be filled ?
Does this mean more flexibility , insecurity and fixed-term contracts ?
The Union is currently restricted to a policy of stability which is certainly necessary but insufficient .
We Socialists desperately want a European pact for growth and employment .
In this respect , the e-Europe initiative is to be welcomed .
The gulfs which are opening up everywhere are the main problem for our era .
For years we have been told over and over that the economy must be liberalised .
The unfettered rise in prices of financial assets and property means that the risks are on the increase .
To conclude , the next five years will be crucial .
I am thinking of transport policy and regional policy .
And do you know why ?
Let me give you three examples .
That makes sense from an economic and an ecological point of view .
Without deregulation we will not make any headway with a reasonable transport policy .
The same applies to European air traffic control .
You still have not finished that agenda .
Commissioner , far too little is said in your paper about regional policy .
Economic and social cohesion in the EU is a fundamental task of this Community .
If we fail to complete it , citizens in less favoured regions will dread enlargement .
Then they too will be prepared to really support enlargement and help to achieve it .
I do not necessarily mean financial resources .
There must also be savings .
It is not easy to combine those aims . There is no obvious way .
Perhaps these issues should be approached with greater attention and a greater esprit de finesse .
That foundation is clearly the single market .
How strongly is the single market established at the moment ?
This is the Commission ' s own survey .
An enlarged Europe must build on the existing strengths of the Union .
The single market extending across that enlarged Union is going to be a colossal achievement .
Yet is this really how we will reconcile the people and European construction ?
It is these questions which cause concern among our fellow citizens .
Our people expect more Europe , but not just any Europe .
A paper this short is a farce .
A paper such as this is no basis for a scoreboard .
We want instruments to prevent abuse .
On the other hand , what does this statement tell us about principles ?
We are certainly in favour of this strategic vision but we need to be brave and ambitious .
Madam President , I should like to add my congratulations to Commissioner Prodi 's programme .
After all , what is social justice if it is without full employment ?
Full employment is the best way to generate social justice for our citizens .
This is a key priority for us to focus on .
That is important and something that can be developed through the Lisbon Summit .
There is still more we have to do , and the Lisbon Summit will become part of that .
So with those remarks I would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success .
The Commission gives no soul to Europe .
Just a few main points .
It seems to me that something is missing from this programme .
Truly European citizenship depends on our creating a real , visible area of training and culture .
Declarations of principle are not enough .
Mr Prodi , what can I say ; what is there that is new ?
There is nothing new in your work programme .
Does that give me hope for the year 2000 ?
No , it does not !
In your work programme for 2000 you state something quite clever .
You say that environmental considerations must be integrated into all other policy areas .
Have you done so , Mr Prodi ; have you even read your work programme for the year ?
No , you have not done so .
You have not integrated it anywhere .
You have tacked a few components together but you have no overall structure .
Mr Prodi , you do not know what you are talking about .
The foodstuffs legislation in the European Union is the most ambitious in the world .
It is no good spending time on hobbies when there is a day ' s work to be done .
That is what we expect of you in the next five years .
Not a single line , nor a single word , refers to fishing or the CFP .
I am not asking for details or specific points , but I believe that a mention was required .
This House has expressed its opinion on the first issue and it will also do so on the second .
Our parliamentary Group will table an amendment in this respect and we expect a positive message from you .
On behalf of the Socialist Group , I would like to focus on the point of internal reform .
They want to see results .
These are really the people who deserve our solidarity .
And this is true even when it addresses the issue of enlargement .
Certainly not !
This document leaves out issues which clearly should have been included .
I think the fact that the Commission does not address the issue of cohesion is extremely serious .
You may draw your own conclusions .
It would be a tragedy if their efforts were to be undermined by deficiencies in EU legislation .
That is something we must guard against .
Madam President , the presentation by President Prodi today has necessarily been a fairly broad brush affair .
We need to move that agenda forward with great urgency now .
We need to break away from planned economy subsidies in favour of a liberal policy which fosters personal responsibility .
This has since been unanimously approved .
I hope that this is a misunderstanding .
Please , Mr Prodi , stand by your word and implement your promises .
If we do not take steps to deal with that , we will fail ultimately .
Thank you , Mr De Rossa .
On behalf of the House , I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament .
The Parliament services asked to meet with the assistants yesterday to make the necessary physical arrangements .
However , the appointment was cancelled at the last minute .
Can you explain why the approval given to the assistants was withdrawn at the last minute ?
Without them we would not be able to function .
Mr President , I also rise on a point of order .
But all exhibitions are in fact looked at first by the so-called Comart committee .
Thank you , Mrs Banotti .
I think your intervention may clarify various points that were raised .
Mr President , I wanted to point out an important matter of principle .
We shall now proceed to the vote.1
We have also voted in favour of paragraph 13 .
In terms of human rights , this is a backward step .
McCarthy report ( A5-0026 / 2000 )
Disparate actions are not effective .
As with all other Community initiatives , this is very positive .
There can be no worse situation than that of an elderly person living in a city .
However , nothing is said about the causes of this crisis and those responsible for it .
The success of URBAN during the 1994-1999 programming period is indisputable .
The results are clear in terms of the improvement of the quality of life in the target areas .
This CIP has encouraged the development of best practice models in the economic , social and environmental sectors .
We can therefore welcome its adoption .
We must , however , admit that in financial terms we cannot proclaim a victory !
The total appropriation allocated is not up to the challenge .
The chosen threshold of 50 projects seems too low .
Drug dealing in particular fuels insecurity and delinquency .
Faced with these social challenges , the effectiveness of the Structural Funds is still in doubt .
The URBAN Community Initiative is helping to achieve the European Union ' s desire to communitise urban policy .
It would be more appropriate for the EU to concentrate its financial efforts on pre-existing European policies .
In fact , the beneficiaries of too many and too high subsidies will eventually just take these for granted .
The aim must not be to help the people but to make them take responsibility .
Finally , the report specifically highlights actions in favour of ethnic or sociological minorities .
We can only condemn a policy on minorities which is inevitably dangerous for social cohesion .
Decourrière report ( A5-0028 / 2000 )
Mr President , the INTERREG programme is particularly close to our hearts .
These projects must therefore be properly taken into account and must integrate sustainable development .
Why am I stressing this point ?
I am particularly thinking in this respect of certain infrastructures which are under construction .
This is why the INTERREG Community Initiative was launched in 1990 .
INTERREG resources must also contribute to the development of a European research area .
I hope everyone , like Mr Decourrière , whom I congratulate , will realise this !
- ( FR ) The INTERREG Community Initiative is just one element of an ill-fated European regional policy .
This loss is unjustified in a region whose main activities have been ruined by free-trade Europe .
However , Mr Decourrière does show some common sense by denouncing the failings of the Brussels technocrats .
These are the procedures which caused the corruption scandal in the previous Commission .
This is why the National Front voted against the report .
The maritime world has great potential .
. ( DA ) The European project began as a partnership between States .
The EU should be prepared to meet that competition .
We can only do that by intensifying co-operation within the Community .
It is about co-operating on joint projects and about unifying forces on all sides .
I therefore welcome the continuation of the programme .
Procacci report ( A5-0025 / 2000 )
Without agriculture , the rural world will disappear .
LEADER + will last a year longer than LEADER 2 .
We disagree with many of the report ' s views .
Once more , we point to the negative changes of the CAP ( 1992 - Agenda 2000 ) .
For our part , we will tell the farmers about the expediency of these programmes .
The rapporteur ' s phrasing was therefore too limiting .
In essence , we are , of course , in favour of this LEADER + Community Initiative .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Additives in feedingstuffs
As far as we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are concerned , so far so good .
We have now tabled a proposed amendment on precisely this compromise with the Commission on the text .
The Commission pointed out in committee that it plans to present a novel feed directive in the future .
We are therefore assuming that you will accept our proposed amendment with regard to genetically-modified organisms .
I can hardly wait , Commissioner Byrne , to hear what you have to say to our proposals .
As far the Commission and the Legal Affairs Committee are concerned , it comes under competition .
People are especially wary of GMOs .
Responsible citizens should , in my view , have a choice .
I too , therefore , can hardly wait to hear what you have to say to our proposed amendments .
In other words , we shall be discussing other proposals here in Parliament over the next few months .
The regulation proposed by the Commission conceals the danger of creating a marketing monopoly for certain additives .
This would then apply until the re-assessment procedure has been completed .
This already gives us a basis for the authorisation of GMOs .
The labelling of genetically-modified additives is particularly important in this respect .
I think that we can all hardly wait to hear Mr Byrne ' s reply .
However , I should like once again to raise the issue of antibiotics .
I should like to say a few words about coccidiostats .
They are a zootechnical product which is not totally necessary .
There is a substitute , which is used to vaccinate chickens .
Although it is a little more expensive , it does not harm the environment .
However , before labelling we need clear rules .
The negative consequences are well known , the positive ones less so .
However , more work is needed on this .
Those found in breach of them must be dealt with severely .
I compliment the new Commissioner responsible for food safety , Mr Byrne .
A coherent legal framework must be re-established .
The consumer must remain free to make a fully informed decision .
This proposal has no financial consequences for the Community budget .
First , perhaps , I should say something on the question of the legal base .
Allow me to comment briefly on two other points . First , genetically modified micro-organisms in feedingstuffs .
The rapporteur has done just that and that is a good sign .
There are serious shortcomings in both areas and we have a great deal of work to do yet .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
We must strike a balance between them .
GMOs are the new challenge facing us .
The main problem is a financial one , namely who bears the cost ?
We need an equitable distribution of the extra cost that has been incurred .
The scope of the proposed amendment is therefore very limited .
Five amendments have been presented by Parliament .
I shall deal with each of the individual amendments separately .
I am the first to accept that GMOs are a very important issue .
I can also assure Parliament that all observations made here today will be fully taken into account .
I should just like to deal with some of the specific issues that were raised during the debate .
The text taken by Parliament is from the Directive which was adopted in 1998 .
It is before Parliament for second reading .
Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi made reference to this .
There are just a few points I should like to make on that issue .
Indeed any such applicants can still apply in respect of their particular product .
The jurisprudence of the Court appears to be quite clear in relation to this .
Directive 70 / 524 foresees the issue of labelling in the genetic modification of additives .
So this issue will be addressed .
Mr President , allow me to ask the Commissioner one more question .
For example , you did not go into antibiotics .
We are therefore talking about harmonising the legal provisions in the individual directives .
Commissioner Byrne , it appears that you want to engage in a test of strength with Parliament .
We negotiated the seed marketing legislation for two years .
I look forward to the next round .
It is being addressed and will be addressed in a comprehensive way , particularly in Directive 90 / 220 .
It is best to wait for that debate which , I understand , will take place fairly soon .
All of these matters will be addressed in that legislation .
Thank you , Commissioner .
Parliament has taken due note of your comments .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
From this point of view we are slightly behind the times .
I am therefore in complete agreement with the Commission ' s proposal on scrapie .
We insist on this .
And it is still on the agenda today .
The cast is always the same .
I have yet to submit my report on TSEs to the House .
At first we were somewhat irresolute and we regret that now .
But I have come to the conclusion that it was in fact quite clever timing .
It will become more difficult once we see the TSE proposal , Mr Byrne .
How will BSE status in fact be defined then ?
When will you make it compulsory ?
Perhaps you will do so before Parliament debates the TSE report .
I know that I am a thorn in your side on this , but sometimes that is my job .
That is , without doubt , too short , too sweet and too little .
Finally , just one more brief comment , Mr Byrne .
We have a new Commission .
But you must understand that we cannot let you get away with this .
And you would be well advised to do likewise from the outset .
Animals are bought throughout Europe and transported over the entire continent .
The disease is always fatal .
In the previous speech Mrs Schierhuber said that scrapies is an insidious disease .
It is indeed .
I wish to stress how important it is for us to remain free of disease .
Mr President , I too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur .
No-one would want to see what happened to farmers with BSE happen ever again .
We have to bring in the most stringent rules and we have to make them work .
BSE has certainly not gone away .
You can see it in different countries .
It will be there for some time to come .
If we are not able to achieve that then we will have tremendous trouble in the future .
I should also like to thank Mr Böge for his work on this issue .
The detailed rules would then follow in that framework proposal .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Community policy in the field of water
Yet we also know that the deterioration of the oceans will significantly destabilise whole areas of our planet .
The European Union ' s water policy is not starting from zero .
The preparation of this framework directive is therefore prompted by a desire for rationalisation .
To conclude , the issues are clear at this second reading .
Do we want to shorten the deadlines proposed by the Council for this directive ?
Do we seriously want to respond to the hopes of our peoples ?
You see , there are numerous matters of concern here and they are all very different .
Some want tighter legislation , some want more clarification , others want to serve national interests .
Our line is to work towards realistic objectives and practicable solutions .
We obviously reject all unrealistic demands which affect the European Parliament ' s credibility .
For me , that includes the zero demand , i.e. the demand for zero inputs up to 2020 .
That would sound the death knell for every agricultural and many industrial undertakings .
Farmers have voiced a number of concerns over the past few days .
You can only farm if you have an adequate supply of clean water .
I therefore extend my special thanks to my colleagues in the group who helped us find compromises .
The framework directive on water is a necessary initiative .
Nobody doubts that water is a resource of interest to all of us .
One example is water transfers .
We want to build a Europe with a sustainable and healthy environment .
This brings home the connections which bind us together .
It is important for us to remember that this is a framework .
These brushstrokes are indeed very broad .
There are many opportunities to hide .
That is the time to debate some of these problems of detail .
This is something that they prefer to avoid doing .
The principle also concerns water charging .
I want to refer to the political position here .
The common position has weakened the stand taken by Parliament at first reading .
Some of the NGOs would say that the directive as now framed is worse than useless .
It is a retrograde step .
This is an opportunity for us to improve the situation .
We need to get ourselves into a position of conciliation .
We have seen vote after vote lost .
Measure after measure has come out of the Environment Committee .
We have failed to achieve a qualified majority .
Our attempt to improve the environment of Europe has failed .
We need to get into that conciliation position .
A hundred and twenty-nine chemical substances had to be regulated .
Eventually , standards were drawn up for only a dozen or so substances .
The unanimity principle was at the root of this debacle .
This sentiment is partly reflected in the common position which came about under British Socialist Presidency .
This is unusual , but most of these amendments are desperately needed to plug the holes .
The dangerous chemical substances constitute a big leak .
Only the background level of the ocean is acceptable .
This is what is meant by the term " close-to-zero " .
For the substance TBT , this means that it can no longer be used as an anti-fouling substance .
A sound alternative would be to clean the ship ' s sides mechanically .
The Council 's common position is totally inadequate in a number of areas .
Therefore , our task is to make the requirements in the directive tighter and more concrete .
Secondly , I should like the phasing out of noxious materials to be carried out consistently .
Thirdly , we should like a clear statement regarding the pricing policy .
We should like to see the scope of a couple of points extended .
However , some people in our political group think otherwise .
Water is a renewable but limited natural resource .
We are not , fortunately , at this point .
For example , France , the Rhine valley and central Europe recently suffered flooding .
Yet we also need to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity into this new management of water .
The water issue will definitely not be settled today .
In fact , the problems of enlargement and climate change will offer new prospects .
This is enough reason to thank Mrs Lienemann for the efforts she has made to obtain sound surface water .
It seems rather complicated to attain a proper European legislative framework .
However , a great deal of attention must be paid to its viability .
It is also very hard to adopt policy in this respect because the discrepancies are so huge .
I would like to enter into the two elements of this topic in more detail .
I would first of all like to focus on quality .
The Netherlands is significantly affected by the European water policy .
Another important point of discussion is the standardisation of water quality .
I would now like to say a few words on quantity management .
Water is a basic necessity of life and a fundamental right .
Water is often a source of conflict between countries and peoples .
This is why it is important that water becomes subject to international coordination .
We need to recognise that water is a joint liability .
Cooperation within a catchment basin must be self-evident .
Coordination is the key word here .
The problem of water is becoming increasingly topical .
Changes in the climate and minor rises in temperature have a direct impact on precipitation .
Some areas are becoming drier , whilst many are becoming wetter .
It is time for action .
In March , the Second World Water Forum will be held in The Hague .
This Forum stands for a worldwide vision .
This vision must translate into regional action plans for sustainable water management and water control .
The time for action is upon us .
But we should not lower our standards too much either .
The common position is not ambitious enough .
This is why it is necessary to refer to previous international agreements , or the OSPAR objectives .
We need to aim for dangerous substances to be phased out by 2020 .
The OSPAR objectives are now being drawn up .
A list has been compiled , containing 400 substances which produce clear risks for the environment .
Needless to say , the directive also needs to be binding .
Countries downstream must be able to count on the fact that countries upstream meet the quality objectives .
Quality has a price , but pollution could well have a much higher price tag in future .
It is therefore strategically important that responsibility for water is established .
First OSPAR .
Merely pulling proposals out of the air is not enough .
What we need is a completely legally binding objective for OSPAR .
It is also important to reinforce the polluter pays principle because prices must speak the ecological truth .
With closed production circuits this is possible ; anything else would water down the directive .
Let us grab our chance .
I understand this .
There are also difficulties with the issue of transfers .
Mr President , my compliments to the rapporteur on a splendid report .
The latter has already brought forward its common position on this matter .
No specific target date for the implementation of this principle was included in the common position .
Mr President , I want first of all to say thank you to Mrs Lienemann for her report .
It is crucial to adhere to a limit upon total discharges of chemicals into our waters .
We cannot afford to wait .
Mr President , it is difficult to summarise the areas covered by such a large and complex directive .
This situation is loudly echoed in many sectors of the economy , and especially in the agricultural sector .
This directive contains a number of very positive elements which are worth highlighting .
Secondly , there is compulsory cooperation .
Thirdly , I should like to address the question of the timetable .
Compare it with what happens in December .
We all know in December that Christmas Eve falls on 24th December and we start buying presents .
But what would we do if we knew in December that Christmas was in thirty years ' time .
This cannot be done , and it also , in any case , goes against nature .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , water is a precious raw material .
Millions of people do not even have clean water - a absolute necessity for survival - at their disposal .
It should , therefore , not surprise us that water is the cause of wars .
The capitalist world too sends out its pawns in order to gain maximum control over water reservoirs .
General interest or solidarity often do not come into the equation .
We were recently rapped on the knuckles by the Commission regarding this matter .
The period of implementation can even be extended up to 34 years .
By then , my children will be older than I am now .
You have to admit : this is a joke .
I would like to finish off with this observation .
In the past couple of months , we have witnessed a great deal of lobbying in Belgium .
What was remarkable about this dossier was the enormous pressure from the Council of Ministers .
They have opted for the weak common position in favour of our Parliament ' s more drastic positioning .
Ladies and gentlemen , fine words are no longer sufficient .
We need to change tack completely .
This can only benefit our credibility .
The debate is suspended and will resume at 9 p.m.
The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform
Ensuring that our citizens understand who does what in our various institutions is the very least we can do .
We want to encourage debate among the people .
That is all I have to say for the moment .
Colleagues , you know the rules .
You are expected to ask questions , not necessarily make lengthy statements .
You have one minute each in which to ask your question .
Moreover , this initiative is consistent with recommendations made by Parliament itself in its resolution of 18 November .
It is one of the most wonderful words in a democracy and must be used .
Will you confirm what is the case ?
Mr Haarder , to my knowledge no official has been authorised to say such a thing .
Clearly , Parliament has its own representatives present , Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos .
Mr Beazley , my answer is clearly yes but that is no surprise .
Mr President , firstly I would like to compliment the Commission on its approach .
My second question is of a critical nature .
The European Commission has just issued a proposal on transparency .
The documents will in the main be open working documents .
We will open an Internet forum and create permanent discussion forums .
The Commissioners will undertake to respond rapidly to any questions raised .
These are the modern means to be used .
However , I believe we must also make the effort to get as close as possible to the people .
I have evidence that this is possible .
The majority of you hold these debates in your constituencies and regions .
He can come with both the hats that he wears as a Commissioner .
I would like to ask him how vigorous the Commission will be in this information campaign ?
Mr Corbett , thank you for your comments .
I can perform this dual task .
Next week I will go to the Bundestag in Berlin .
I have already appeared before the French Senate .
Is not Mr Barnier nervous about penetrating the inner workings of the Member States ' election processes ?
Can such matters be controlled from Brussels ?
Is this an element in the radical decentralisation which Mr Prodi talked about this morning ?
I do not think so .
This will therefore be our rule .
I am well aware of the sensitivity of these taxation and social protection issues .
I do not believe that all the national systems of social protection should be made identical .
We will therefore conduct this dialogue with the towns and regions .
Mr Berthu , the Helsinki mandate is clear and we are working within this .
Thank you , Commissioner .
You have answered the questions precisely and also opened the dialogue for Europe that you referred to .
You have set a very good example of time-keeping today .
That concludes the debate .
Question Time ( Commission )
The next item is Question Time ( B5-0009 / 2000 ) . We will examine questions to the Commission .
Question No 36 by ( H-0025 / 00 ) :
The statistics quoted on child mortality speak for themselves and are wholly unacceptable .
However , the situation is hardly better for other parts of the population .
UNMIK has already taken a significant role in this field .
Progress is slow due to the tense relations between the ethnic groups of this divided city .
However , the Commission is maintaining its efforts with the support of UNMIK for this project .
We hope that one day it may become a symbol promoting the benefits of ethnic reconciliation .
The Commission is now turning to the programming of 2000 funds .
We expect to dedicate a considerable sum to improving the healthcare system .
I am sure the honourable Member did not mean that .
We are dealing with a horrific story in Kosovo .
In some cases , there have been incidents of food containing insects and such like .
Are you aware of this ?
Are you prepared to act upon it ?
This is my first additional question .
My second question pertains to the reconstruction of the hospital in Mitrovica .
What does the Commission intend to do in order to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can get to hospital ?
Secondly , I do understand exactly what the honourable Member is saying about Mitrovica .
We will try to address them , but it is not easy .
Question No 37 by ( H-0029 / 00 ) :
That statement could not be much clearer .
Question No 38 by ( H-0040 / 00 ) :
I have a related point .
It concerns the implications of the dam on access to fresh water in the region as a whole .
Can you say whether you will indeed raise this point as well ?
We will certainly raise the point made by the honourable Member .
There have also been considerable anxieties expressed about the potential danger to the archaeological heritage in the area .
We will raise that , too , in the representations we make .
Question No 39 by ( H-0036 / 00 ) :
Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda ?
What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes ?
What are the Commission 's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union ?
The rights conferred by this Charter will have at least two types of beneficiary .
We hope that this important Cologne Council decision will become a reality .
In this context , the criteria by which these rights are to be chosen must be clearly indicated .
I understand your concern about the rights of children .
This is an area in which the principle of subsidiarity applies fully .
Each Member State is principally responsible for defining its responsibilities towards children .
However , I should like to ask a slightly different question .
It is very important that the people feel engaged in this process .
Will the Commission look at using its information budget to ensure people are engaged in this debate ?
There is no contradiction between the two .
The challenge we have is to bring them together in the final version of the Charter .
I am very glad to know that I can count on your support here .
Question No 40 by ( H-0095 / 00 ) :
These concerns are legitimate and there are good reasons for them .
The Commission is not a State . It cannot and must not act as if it were one .
Individuals and governments should be judged by what they do rather than by what they say .
In Austria ' s case , the statements are contradictory to say the least .
I thank the Commissioner for his reply to my question .
Could the Commissioner answer two questions .
Firstly he talked about verification .
Can he tell us how that verification will take place and who will do it ?
We are not talking about words here .
We are talking about deeds by the Freedom Party and Mr Haider .
Regarding the situation in Carinthia , we need to look at this in detail .
The honourable Member raised the question .
We should not only focus this debate on the Austrian question .
That question calls for reflection , for debate and , if necessary , for action .
Thank you very much , Mr Vitorino , for your valuable contribution to this Question Time .
Questions to Mrs Wallström
Question No 41 by ( H-0021 / 00 ) :
The Commission is currently carefully reviewing the United States ' arguments .
My question specifically concerned the reaction of the US Government to the text of the preliminary draft .
Is this the text which you will be submitting , or an amendment to the original version ?
Thank you for the follow-up question .
It is important for me to have a chance to answer it .
The dialogue has been fruitful and has led to our preparing a proposal .
I start from the assumption that we should in fact introduce these .
However , I do want to listen to all the points of view .
Question No 42 by ( H-0026 / 00 ) :
Moreover , we are trying hard to attract qualified women to participate in our consultation groups .
Thank you for your reply .
This is a crucial goal .
I have some experience in drawing up plans and following them up .
I hope that this will be of benefit .
Question No 43 by ( H-0045 / 00 ) :
Is the Commission ready to suspend funding completely , pending a review of the development plans of the area ?
An in-depth environmental impact assessment had been carried out .
However , since last summer the measure just mentioned has been in dispute .
Firstly , the Irish authorities withdrew their earlier commitment to carry out improvements .
However , the new commitment included some minor changes which , in turn , led to a further complaint .
- I do not quite understand what the Commissioner said .
You say there will be no further funding .
If not , why not ?
If you are , when exactly are you going to do it ?
Is this right and proper ?
What is your opinion on that ?
Even the area designated by the Commissioners as a special protection area has been destroyed .
Compensation afterwards is not going to make up for the damage that was done .
There is to date no conclusive outcome to this legal challenge .
Mr President , sadly , the specific case raised by Mrs McKenna is not an isolated one .
It is only such action which will discourage this practice in the future .
( SV ) This is a very important question .
The message contained in the joint text is still valid .
The result may , of course , be some difficult questions of priorities .
I should just like to point out once again that the joint text still holds good .
The Rules of Procedure do not allow this .
You will have to discuss this outside the Chamber .
Questions to Mr Barnier
Question No 44 by ( H-0020 / 00 ) :
I am also saying this as a former environment minister .
This is all I can say .
However , things are really quite different .
There are only a few weeks to go before the elections .
My question to the Commissioner is this : what is to be done ?
Will the Commission remain silent ?
Will it discuss the matter ?
Having said that , I thought your question related more to the partnership issue .
I cannot do other than work with the Greek Government .
What can the Commission do about that ?
Having said this , I will look at the situation objectively .
Question No 45 by ( H-0041 / 00 ) :
Will the Structural Funds also finance the large-scale energy transmission networks ?
This is about 6 % of the whole Community contribution .
Could you please give an answer on this issue ?
Quite simply there is no question of this .
As a result , the Commission services are not systematically informed of all projects selected .
I thought I had answered your question on large-scale energy transmission networks .
Question No 46 by ( H-0052 / 00 ) :
Please excuse this very legal answer .
Very well : that is to be the unchanging rule .
Does section 11 ( 1 ) conceivably authorise the following practice .
Is that really authorised ?
I am aware of the Member ' s competence on these matters .
- Additionality is a major issue too in Wales , which I represent .
And yet we still have these problems in Wales and in Scotland .
Question No 47 by ( H-0088 / 00 ) :
Questions to Mr Bolkestein
I would point out to the Commissioner that Mr Aznar is the President of the Spanish Government .
You may answer the question .
I have given you my answer .
It is the responsibility of these authorities and governments to allocate the funds as objectively and fairly as possible .
We were talking a short while ago in this House about debates involving our citizens , about public debates .
This is all I can say today .
Thank you very much for your replies , Mr Barnier .
Questions Nos 48 to 50 will be replied to in writing .
Question No 51 by ( H-0049 / 00 ) :
The Office is not yet ready to move into the new building .
Unfortunately , a number of deadlines have been exceeded .
During the previous question , we were discussing electoral issues .
If you had been there , I am sure you would have been ashamed .
The President of the Commission and some secretaries were present .
As such , I would prefer to withhold any comment on the situation which Mr Berenguer has just described .
I hope that this building will then be occupied .
I would like to point out to the Commissioner that it is not an electoral question .
We should ask ourselves to what extent this spending of funds was justified .
I would like to reiterate that the Commission is unconcerned with the underlying motivation of Member State actions .
It is , however , interested in official statements and actions .
We do not intend to go in the direction of what is termed in French un procès d 'intention .
We are concerned with public official actions and events , rather than any possible underlying motivation .
As far as I am concerned , all expenditure is real .
And any remaining skeletons , I intend to leave them in the cupboard .
Question No 54 by ( H-0117 / 00 ) :
I would like to answer these two questions as follows .
My position on this is clear .
I cannot see a reason , therefore , why a further extension for this measure should be proposed .
I also discussed this matter with the Swedish parliamentary Finance committee last week .
It is now up to the Swedish government to take the necessary measures .
Thank you for your reply .
Such a rule is only normal .
My second question concerns the whole policy on alcohol .
However , in the case of Sweden , the situation is different .
Secondly , the Swedish Government is being consulted all the way .
Thirdly , I understand very well that the health aspect of this matter is naturally important .
We can cast our minds back to a similar situation in the United States .
Mr Andersson will be familiar with what was termed then ' prohibition ' .
I gather that Mr Posselt has hinted at the fiscal aspects of this matter .
I ask for the Member 's understanding for this small delay in the Commission 's decision .
Can you envisage applying an alcohol - equivalent basis for taxation in Europe ?
That leads to a distortion of the internal market because wine is smuggled from France to the United Kingdom .
The Commission has no means of influence here .
We need not restrict ourselves to alcoholic products .
That is indeed distortion of the internal market .
But I do not have a magic wand and I do not have my way .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
That concludes Questions to the Commission .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
Community policy in the field of water ( continuation )
The development of this directive has been difficult and complex , involving diverse interests and divided opinions .
However , it is almost impossible to understand and correctly assess all the different situations and expectations .
We also reject the amendments which aim to incorporate the integral cost of water for 2010 .
In no field of human activity have we ever discovered a zero degree of pollution .
Mr President , Commissioner , this is a very important directive .
Its aim is to improve the quality of water and the reliability of the water supply and sewage systems .
The public must have a right to clean water .
It is important not only for the environment but also for public health .
We must make sure that we get started quickly with the programme to improve water quality .
Action must get under way immediately .
We cannot afford to waste time .
It is important that the timetable is an ambitious one .
I would like to comment on one issue , which was spoken about earlier .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , congratulations , Mrs Lienemann on an excellent piece of work .
Water and air surround us everywhere .
We share them with everyone on this earth .
Water is a prerequisite for human life .
And there are more and more of us in the world .
Mrs Schleicher intimated earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal .
Nothing could be further from the truth !
However , we should look a little more closely at some points .
Mr President , here we have what is basically a good measure .
We have three outstanding problems .
The first is the transfer of water between basin areas .
That is a matter which affects my colleagues from Spain , Ireland and the United Kingdom .
Secondly , we have to have realistic targets , but targets nevertheless .
We need to look very carefully at those .
The concept of continuing reduction as in Amendment No 58 is much better .
Thirdly , I raise the problem faced by Scotch whisky .
Some of it ends up in the bottle and is drunk .
In that spirit , we support Amendment No 107 by Mr Marset Campos .
We are all entitled to clean drinking water .
I should like to express my great appreciation of Mrs Lienemann ' s work on this matter .
Moreover , I shall only highlight the most important ones .
In this regard , too , I think that the 2010 deadline is appropriate .
First of all we have to find and call to account those who are guilty of the act .
In Finland surface waters are very clean .
The process does not require a chemical sewage plant .
The directive must not be allowed to endanger this work .
This would cause problems for those countries where reserves of water are unevenly distributed .
The ecologically sustainable transfer of water must not be restricted by Union acts .
This applies to every country .
Firstly , I believe that this directive is excessively tough , simplistic and reductionist .
That is how the common position has been worded .
The same can be said with regard to transfers .
Ireland is very supportive of the common position and many of the European Parliament amendments .
A 25-year roll-out for legislation , for example , is hardly acceptable .
The whole purpose of this directive is to promote sustainable use of water in the EU .
Water is a scarce and precious natural resource .
All legislation must be enforceable and be based on the general principle of political acceptance .
These include , for example , costs and transfers .
With regard to costs , I would like clarification of what costs we are talking about .
Are we talking about the distribution and sourcing of water ?
Are we talking about the quality of the distribution networks ?
Are we talking about the nature of the works required to provide water services ?
Or are we talking about large-scale hydraulic works and reservoirs ?
All these costs added together would be horrendous and would have repercussions for the agricultural sector .
Transfers are defined as the transfer of surface water between different territorial areas .
We cannot be accused of bad management .
We are not doing a bad job of management .
Commissioner , Andalusia is not Lapland .
I am pleased about the spirit of agreement which permeates the amendments that have been submitted to Parliament .
Most of Parliament ' s proposed amendments help improve the text and make it more ambitious .
The Commission can approve 72 of the 108 amendments , either in their entirety , partially or in principle .
Many of the amendments which Parliament has submitted show that reconciliation will be necessary .
Firstly , I should like to mention some of my most important arguments .
We now have the opportunity to put into practice those measures to which we agreed under the OSPAR Convention .
Rather than make these objectives legally binding , we must consider their political nature .
This is also reflected in many of Parliament ' s amendments .
But water is not free of charge , any more than houses or food are free of charge .
I just want to emphasise this further .
This is also expressed in Recital 14 .
Allow me now to comment on some of the areas in a little more detail .
Limiting discharges of hazardous substances into our waters must be one of the most important objectives .
I am glad to see that Parliament ' s amendments have focused upon this .
The Commission fully supports the proposal to introduce the commitments under the OSPAR Convention into the text .
We must , however , keep to their precise scope and content .
It would not be in keeping with this to introduce a legally binding timetable .
I therefore welcome Amendments Nos 6 , 10 , 14 , 24 , 58 , 60 and 88 .
Amendment No 59 introduces requirements to the effect that the list of prioritised substances should continually be reviewed .
This would involve legal uncertainty as to the status of the list and cannot , therefore , be approved .
The Nitrates Directive will not therefore be influenced by the present framework directive .
I also support the demand for a suitable contribution from each sector to cover own costs .
I can therefore partly , and in principle , approve Amendments Nos 43-46 , together with Amendment No 85 .
This would constitute a clear goal against which progress could be measured .
This must not , however , be an excuse for subsidising inefficient economic sectors which cause pollution .
We intend shortly to issue a communication from the Commission on precisely this question .
This proposal can therefore be approved .
Another important area is protection of the groundwater .
We also need stricter criteria for interpreting the results of any monitoring .
I would propose that Amendment No 92 should be incorporated into a broader solution .
The proposal cannot therefore be approved .
This part of Amendment No 41 cannot , therefore , be approved .
These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 can , therefore , be approved .
These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 cannot , therefore , be approved .
I would like to hear the Commissioner 's view on Amendment No 45 .
I may have missed it in the list she gave out .
. I accept that .
Thank you , Mrs Wallström .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 p.m.
Financial instrument for the environment ( LIFE )
Patently we have here an instrument that is appropriate for the policies which we wish to implement .
I would stress the LIFE-NATURE strand in particular .
As for us , we our bound by the terms of the texts : a maximum of four months .
We have four very straightforward arguments which we feel justify our choice .
There is no other such policy .
Our concern does not centre purely on the budgetary issue , however .
Obviously , the basic item for discussion with the Council will be the allocation for LIFE III .
The amount that we are asking for is no great mountain of useless expenditure .
Quite the opposite , it is still fairly modest in relation to the requirements to be funded .
A drop in the ocean , I might say , in comparison with Europe ' s structural policies .
This is the price of the future of generations to come .
The first sustainable development projects are unquestionably those .
We are therefore proposing to amend the regulations as follows .
Thirdly , to make prior coordination with the users and communities concerned a prerequisite .
Result : a court action and repair costs greater than the cost of the programme itself .
This is the sort of thing that we want to avoid .
What could be fairer than for Members of Parliament to monitor the use of the appropriations they voted for ?
Fifthly , to publish an annual scientific , technical and financial assessment of LIFE operations carried out .
Six , to carry out proper evaluation of the programmes on a regular basis .
Furthermore , it contains more acceptable systematics and is clearer and more transparent .
However , I would like to insist on certain points .
Firstly , its continuity , which , in principle , I am not questioning .
Secondly , the financial contributions .
Sadly , only 7.2 % of the projects requested receive funds .
Of the EUR 1 919 million requested , only EUR 784 million have been granted .
Now the financial statement shows only EUR 613 million to cover more countries and competences .
Is this not a contradiction ?
Let us not demand from others what we are not prepared to give ourselves ?
Commissioner , we must be consistent .
Two minutes is certainly not long enough to deal with such an important topic .
The environment is in a parlous state .
However , the environment constitutes a far bigger and more serious problem than smoking .
In many areas the parks which are a fundamental element in the LIFE programme have been established .
Amendment No 12 requires a larger budget than that stated in the common position .
I am also convinced that LIFE has great potential .
This instrument could finance good projects with a higher amount of money than that quoted in the proposed budget .
At this stage , the Commission is keeping to the amount which has been set in the common position .
It is therefore meaningless , and often impossible , directly to transfer projects from LIFE to other instruments .
The date will be fixed as soon as the present regulation has been adopted .
Parliament has contributed greatly to improving this instrument .
Thank you , Mrs Wallström .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Modernising social protection
Mr President , the issue of social security systems is an important one .
This is a natural consequence of cooperation within the EU .
It is now a natural consequence to move on to social security systems .
These areas are mutually dependent upon one another .
Economic stability is a reason for growth and can provide high employment .
It also provides the opportunity to develop welfare provision .
In other words , social security is a factor of production .
Social security systems differ from one EU country to another .
This is largely due to historical factors .
The labour market is also changing .
Women are venturing into the labour market in ever greater numbers .
Another challenge is presented by technical development .
We must meet these challenges together .
This is good , but it is not enough .
We propose a procedure like the Luxembourg process .
We are creating a common model , but retaining the principle of subsidiarity .
This social convergence is a process which will continue for a long period .
All this is important .
Equality has no pillar of its own .
There , it is mainstreaming which applies .
This is something we have borne in mind .
These proposals favour women especially .
We expect the Commission to present this as part of its proposal for a social action programme .
We have had a constructive discussion in the Committee .
We had a lot of amendments , but succeeded in agreeing upon a report .
This indicates that we have a broad consensus .
A number of these amendments have come back from the Committee reading , and these I shall reject .
I think this proposal is a good one .
Certainly , it resembles Amendment No 1 , but Amendment No 14 is better .
Finally , I want to say that the EU is not only concerned with cooperation on trade .
The EU is also a union for employment and social justice .
In creating a citizens ' Europe , social policy has an important role to play .
The Lisbon Summit will provide an excellent opportunity to present a strategy of this kind .
Gender-related aspects must feature prominently in all these goals .
The Commission has recognised this interrelatedness .
These aspects are very much interconnected .
We should , of course , not get overly excited about it .
It marks the beginning , rather than the end , of a process .
But it is extremely significant for the process to be set in motion .
The challenges are different .
In this way , we will be able to meet a number of huge challenges .
It is a report which tries to give direction .
I think that a number of MEPs will make reference to this .
All in all , I am indebted to the rapporteur and the Committee for this report .
We believe that this course of action is ambitious , yet achievable .
Needless to say , it is clear that harmonisation of social security is not viable at European level .
But this new course of action is very exciting .
It is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda .
It is not , therefore , about harmonisation but about common objectives .
It is , of course , a fact that the EU countries have different ways of organising social policy .
I feel positive about the movement which is very gradually taking place in the dossier .
This seems to be a good thing and useful .
I also feel positive about the essence of the communication , namely the strategic approach .
We therefore hope that the four objectives which are mentioned in it can reasonably be achieved .
We nonetheless foresee two problems for which solutions will need to be found .
In the case of unemployment benefits , we came across six restrictions and five improvements .
Policy competition mainly occurs in the northern countries .
The highest level of stability and even improvement of social security can be found in the southern countries .
To use a figure of speech , cappuccino is not always good for us .
So far , social policy has remained limited in terms of set-up and resources .
This has undeniable repercussions on social protection which is tied in with labour to a large extent .
In fact , the same phenomenon occurs in tax law .
Denying that such shifts take place is tantamount to surrendering social protection .
The path which the Commission is walking is , in fact , obvious .
I endorse this view .
Mr President , Mr Andersson ' s report contains a lot that is of interest .
Social policy needs to be renewed in order to reduce unemployment in the Member States .
Something must be done so that unemployment does not turn the so-called European model into a parody .
There is no need at all for supranationalism in this area .
It is most especially important not to create unnecessary problems before the enlargement of the EU .
I also welcome the Commission 's communication .
It was slow in coming but well worth waiting for .
This is not an option for us any more .
It is an imperative .
What it has done is increase dramatically the number of working poor in the United States .
That is not what we want to do in Europe .
But we have to grasp the tools to do that .
The simple reason for this was that social costs in the Netherlands were just too high in comparison .
Mr President , we are unable to vote for this report .
The European Union should actually place social issues at the heart of the building of Europe .
Social rights should determine economic choices , and not the other way around .
Any Community intervention should aim to complement and to harmonise existing guarantees according to the highest common denominator .
In order to fight poverty , entitlement to an income and to employment are inalienable rights .
For millions of people the situation is too tragic for that .
Budgetary and exchange rate policies were responsible for maintaining internal and external stability .
And therein lies the paradox .
That is something we would do well to recognise .
All in all , though , I deem this report to be worthwhile .
This message is contained in the excellent report by Mr Andersson .
I would like to make a number of comments about what has been said .
Today , we have the statement by Mr Andersson .
The next point concerns the specific action we have undertaken .
The Portuguese Presidency has focused on two things : sustainable pension systems and social accession .
I think the statement ' s content makes this clear .
As many of the speakers have said , I believe a first important step has been taken .
Thank you , Mrs Diamantopoulou .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
It is about artists ' entitlement to copyright or to protection for their artistic products .
Without protection under intellectual property law , creativity is inhibited and financial incentives obstructed .
Forgeries are big business .
The problem affects a lot of jobs in the entertainment industry .
There exists a special clause which requires Parliament ' s assent in two cases .
With regard to the present agreement , both these conditions are fulfilled .
The agreement also concerns questions dealt with in accordance with the co-decision-making procedure .
Parliament must therefore give its assent , because the agreement concerns its sphere of competence .
Parliament cannot , in any case , at present do anything about the matter .
The agreement complements the Berne Convention in regard to literary works .
It also creates protection for software and databases .
There are problems regarding the term " author " .
For example , it has not been defined .
Another issue , which is somewhat problematic , is that of intermediate storage .
This too has not been solved .
It is dealt with by means of a general clause which does not provide any definition .
That would not be a good thing .
The question of arbitration procedures is still to be resolved , too .
Parliament cannot change these details .
We can only say yes or no to the agreement as it stands .
Yes or no to an agreement which contains deficiencies .
Both myself , as rapporteur , and the committee think we ought to say yes .
I think they should have .
A European patent is in the offing , and that is a good thing .
In that way , we can act as a model for the applicant States .
We have a direct financial interest in these issues being settled before enlargement .
The problem has been overcome .
This ratification is also necessary in the light of the enlargement of Europe .
Our definitions are still too vague and new technologies now make it essential for us to clarify them .
The EU too must proceed in its legislative work in accordance with what is agreed in the WIPO .
The recommendations that have been made will not improve the status of culture in Europe , on the contrary .
There is no consciously adopted position in the WIPO Treaty on temporary copies .
It is essential that the interests of all parties are taken into account .
Parliament has tried to take account of this in its own recommendation .
The Commission is under the impression that she has worked fast and effectively .
This is important .
It befits the Commission to express its gratitude towards the rapporteur .
I would like to stress the importance of both Treaties .
At international level , there is a great deal of support for treaties entering into force more swiftly .
These have now been ratified by twelve or thirteen WIPO Member States , including the United States .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30a.m.
( The sitting was closed at 11.55 p.m. )
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
We were diverted to Basel-Mulhouse Airport .
We were told that a bus would meet us there on arrival .
This sort of service and difficulty in getting to Strasbourg on a Monday is quite hopeless .
I wonder if that could be added to the Minutes .
( The Minutes were approved )
This item has been postponed until the next part-session in March .
It was erroneously included in today ' s agenda .
The smell is absolutely disgusting !
Can you please do something about it ?
Coherence of EU policies with development
Firstly , we need to make the EU ' s development policy more effective .
By this I mean , of course , the internal dynamics of the European Union .
The views of the European Parliament on this issue too , will certainly be both timely and welcome .
I would like to remark that it was a very positive experience taking part in those negotiations .
I saw Member States working as a team , which was indeed a wonderful experience .
I shall outline some of the major innovations in the new agreement .
We refocus development policies on poverty reduction strategies .
We create an investment facility to support the development of the private sector .
We improve the policy framework for trade and investment development .
After Seattle I am sure you will appreciate the significance of these agreements .
Let me turn to some of the more important points .
Firstly the agreement on political issues .
It is thus not confined to EC activities .
This is a very important aspect , taking into account the fundability of public finances .
Another new theme in the ACP-EU agreement is migration .
We have reached a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area .
This also covers persons from third countries and stateless persons .
These very innovative approaches provide a good opportunity to improve governance .
Negotiations will start no later than 2002 .
A six-year period is programmed for these negotiations .
This approach will lead us to a fully WTO compatible regime .
Economic operators will be more inclined to establish closer relations with their ACP partners .
In addition , the agreements with the EU will act as an anchor .
As regards the volume of the next EDF , the EU has made its financial proposal .
This will enable the Community to substantially increase annual flows of commitments and payments during this period .
Such a commitment entails an in-depth reform of procedures and implementation modalities on both sides .
Turning to our development policy , I would say that the global context has changed drastically .
It is within this changing global framework that we have to position ourselves .
Human resources are too thin in relation to the volume of aid that we are supposed to manage .
This is difficult to reconcile with the needs of an effective management system .
This is very much the line also just presented by Minister Amado .
When we talk policies nowadays , we engage in a process of convergence .
This is part of the solution .
Everything has become more and more complex .
This is also true of development cooperation .
This is where we want to go .
It is vital to make Community policy more effective and to develop a more operational strategic framework .
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank Mr Amado and Mr Nielson .
I am pleased that Mr Amado talked about the EDF .
Mr President , I thank Mr Nielson .
We want to talk about coherence .
This is the topic .
This problem has been highlighted on several occasions , to whit in 1992 , in 1995 and 1997 .
The examples are all quoted in a resolution which lies before us .
I have raised questions regarding this issue for years now .
But what have we seen since then ?
It is , therefore , with good reason that we bring this up here today .
I would like to give you a few examples to illustrate these contradictions .
A number of developing countries grow sugar cane for sugar production .
In the Union , sugar is produced from sugar beet .
At the same time , we give these countries an enormous amount of development aid .
Another example is cacao .
It seems to be heading this way nevertheless .
What are we actually doing then ?
This is also typical of a policy which makes citizens wonder what Brussels actually does ?
There are also shocking examples in terms of sanctions and embargoes .
The inconsistency is astonishing .
This is also at the request of the citizens .
We have been saying this ourselves since back in 1992 : this is the topic of this debate .
The topic touches the very core of the European Union .
What are the objectives which each EU policy needs to take into account ?
The interests of the citizens are only served by a credible and reliable government .
We should not make reality out to be more rose-tinted than it really is .
Reality is obstinate .
What we are talking about here today is not an issue which can be toyed with at leisure .
Poverty in the third world is a harrowing problem that demands urgent attention .
What we need here is an integral approach .
The second area of incoherence is aid to authoritarian regimes .
The third area of incoherence is human rights .
We say that we want to protect human rights .
We encourage developing countries to respect human rights .
We even adopt numerous resolutions condemning every violation of human rights .
We ally ourselves with demonstrations and international campaigns .
Nor do we do much to really prevent human rights violations .
We must leave raw materials so that local manufacturers can process them .
The eighth area of incoherence is of a political and practical nature .
We are always saying think globally , act locally .
Seattle was a failure , and north-south relations were in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons .
This goes to show just how topical this subject is .
A new agreement has been reached with the ACP countries .
Certain politically important aspects of the new partnership agreement will have contributed to these .
But we have not heard a single word on this subject , and I find that deeply embarrassing .
We have been waiting for a report on coherence for years .
There is neither coherence nor human decency here .
Why will neither the Council nor the Commission admit the fact ?
Mr President , how policy decisions are arrived at is surely fundamental .
Is the Council discussing this issue ?
How decisions are made is all-important .
However , the Council statement gave me hope for the future .
I will give some examples shortly .
Some of these issues have been discussed in depth .
I wish the Commission well in its task of producing that basic document .
Mr President , this morning ' s debate is very important .
In today ' s globalised world , this fact is all the more obvious .
There are no boundaries for Community policies .
Both institutions identify the most important areas where this idea should be applied .
The Commission is addressing a very important area , that is , commercial policy .
But we who sit here in Parliament do not doubt for a second what the reason is .
And there is no sign of this trend ' s being reversed .
These figures are from before the Internet revolution took off .
At some time or another , there will be a revolt , and it will be fully justified .
Above all , however , we should give the countries concerned the opportunity to trade with us .
This is not new .
One of the major conclusions of this report concerned the European policy ' s internal conflict .
We seem unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries .
I advocate transparent , joint and efficient development policy .
So there is a whole raft of contradictions .
We have to be aware of this .
That is a fact of life .
Take the trade agreements .
Today beef stocks stand at 300 000 tonnes .
Who will be next , quite literally , for the chop ?
Action simply has not been taken .
I ask Mr Nielson , in his summing-up , to directly address those points in the resolution .
The results are certainly not what we expected .
What could be the cause of this ?
No farmer , anywhere in the world , will produce something if prices are too low .
Special attention is also required for the costs of the means of production .
Finally , I wonder whether the funds could not be put to better use .
Since Amsterdam , three terms have taken centre stage : complementarity , coordination and cohesion .
I believe that very little has been achieved in these three fields .
One thing shocked me in the speech of the President-in-Office of the Council .
He stated : " Contradictions in policy can lead to balance . "
This is supposed to be our priority , would you believe .
The first is concerned with conflict resolution .
The UN has a peace plan .
We ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial episode in Africa to an end .
I also want to take up the subject of migration .
We now know that at least one person in the world dies of hunger every four seconds .
Three quarters of those who die are children under five years of age .
Food safety and the guarantee of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interests .
The latter include trade , agricultural and fisheries policies .
In this economy , the connection between different policy areas is that much more marked .
I cannot help but wonder why the Commission has not done more .
Let us hope that the debate in which we are now engaged will prove to have been a watershed .
There are a lot of people who will be watching further developments with great interest .
It did not work ; poverty became worse than ever .
Is that not the lesson of the European Union itself and of the single market in particular ?
Yet preaching the benefits of free trade to the developing countries is not enough .
The Member States have spent similar amounts .
This has been talked about for years .
For these are prerequisite to any development .
If these criteria are not adhered to , then development does not stand a chance
The same goes for Cuba , Mr Modrow .
After all , we are all familiar with the reports from Amnesty International .
Nonetheless , these are important criteria for the European Union .
There is a second issue I would like to raise .
We are discussing coherence here .
Many speakers have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are not coherent .
In our view , cooperation is , and should remain , an intergovernmental exercise .
Why should we add to them ?
And let me say in passing , it is even more astonishing that the Council allowed it to .
Finally , a word on the general thinking behind the Corrie report .
. I sense some degree of frustration in many of the contributions to this debate .
We will furnish more detailed material relating directly to all the issues concerning coherence .
This discussion is not new .
This exists , but it is only a small part of what we are discussing .
From that perspective , what I am saying here is of deep relevance .
We should not be too masochistic .
There is a limit to how useful that is .
All these cases are characterised by the fact that they have been taken care of .
These are real problems , but they have all been dealt with .
What was mentioned concerning sugar in the Caribbean is more complicated .
Finally , I thank you again for this debate .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Nielson .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.
Next session of UN Human Rights Commission
This draft resolution was defeated by a Chinese no-action motion .
The European Union voted against that motion .
It is not surprising that the debate is long and difficult .
We know what happened recently at the UN General Assembly .
The New York stage is different from Geneva .
It certainly influenced the debate on the moratorium on the death penalty .
The debate in Geneva , however , is more focused on human rights issues .
We may therefore stand a better chance of making progress there .
Secondly , Cuba .
We are also worried by the recent increase in the number of political detentions .
We have regularly put our criticisms to the Cuban authorities , and this Parliament has done the same .
But I do not believe that the right approach is to try to isolate Cuba .
Quite simply , I want us to be engaged with China .
So what should we do ?
So what should be our attitude towards a Geneva resolution this year ?
That is a point that deserves serious consideration .
Chinese leaders are in no doubt about our position on all these issues and on developments in Tibet .
We have made our views very clear to them .
The next dialogue in Lisbon on 25 February will be an important test .
It will show whether the dialogue is producing results or not .
What , finally , do we want to see as the first steps ?
I wish we were closer to that .
Where does all that leave us this year ?
I repeat that Member States will have to make up their minds .
That , in my judgement , is the challenge for the next few weeks .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Patten .
( Loud applause )
The Commission can also accept Amendment No 4 in principle .
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 3 , 5 , 6 , 12 , 14 , 18 and 16 .
( The President declared the common position approved as amended )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Before the final vote :
That is the appropriate way of dealing with this .
( Parliament decided to refer the report back to committee )
Before the vote :
( Applause from the left . Heckling from the right )
As a political force , we serve to guarantee that Austria will continue to embrace European values .
I refuse to allow myself to be ostracised for internal and party political reasons !
This does not reflect the truth of the situation but is pure propaganda .
I utterly reject this !
( Loud , sustained applause from the centre and from the right , protests from the left )
I hope the delegation has an excellent visit to Strasbourg .
( Loud applause )
VOTE ( continuation )
Thank you for your attention .
( The President declared the common position approved as amended )
( Parliament adopted the resolution ) President .
That concludes the vote
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Lienemann report ( A5-0014 / 2000 )
. ( FR ) I welcome the quality and the ambition of this report on LIFE .
In my opinion , the most important amendments concern the following :
I support Mrs Lienemann ' s firm stance .
Böge report ( A5-0023 / 2000 )
These rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie .
The European Parliament has relayed their concerns and they have been heard .
Cederschiöld report ( A5-0008 / 2000 )
We are therefore voting in favour of the recommendation .
Moreover , the concept of ' author ' is not defined in the Treaties .
Graefe zu Baringdorf ( A5-0015 / 2000 )
The precautionary principle must therefore apply in the absence of scientific certainty .
The profit motive is very much behind the present food safety crises .
Stenzel report ( A5-0034 / 2000 )
This is why we are abstaining .
These were our reasons for abstaining from the vote on this report .
We want EQUAL to go ahead .
The time has come for concrete measures and for putting theory into practice .
The lessons we have learned under these actions must be built on .
EQUAL stands for " equality " .
It must be seen to deliver .
There must be flexibility .
I deeply regret that only limited funds are available for this initiative .
The figure is now 5.35 % .
I also stressed the need for prevention .
The involvement of the social partners also needs to be highlighted .
There must be flexibility and the administrative burden must be reduced as a priority .
There must be flexibility also for countries with small budgets .
This is a great deal to build on such fragile foundations .
The Commission did not do that .
We hope that it will at least revisit the aspects that we have mentioned .
( End of fiction ) .
Once more we must remember that we are undergoing a continental project for political union .
A simple gesture such as turning on a tap seems to bring water straight from the source .
But the source is threatening to run dry .
But tomorrow will be too late .
We have to lay down the rules of play today , before we all lose .
We have thrown water a life-belt .
Specific directives will then be adopted within this framework .
The procedure involved in drafting this text was lengthy .
There is much to be praised in the approach to the problem suggested by the rapporteur .
These are the main reasons for my vote .
I support the objectives of this community action in the field of water policy .
Water , in this context , is a commercial commodity .
From this point of view , the common position is weak .
On the contrary , I object to this systematically applied strategy .
It damages Parliament .
Our messages to our citizens and to the Council are muddled and lack credibility .
Is that the message we want to send out ?
In fact , water becomes simply one more product subject to the laws of the market .
This means that the neoliberal model now reigns in the field of water .
We believe therefore that conciliation will set a more realistic date .
The foregoing is the reason for our vote .
( FR ) Water is a renewable but limited natural resource and needs to be properly managed .
The framework directive on water policy will become the cornerstone of Community policy in this area .
It has clear , ambitious objectives .
We share them .
It sets environmental parameters close to zero .
We need a timetable , by all means , but a more gradual timetable .
Andersson report ( A5-0033 / 2000 )
No-one would benefit from this type of harmonisation " .
I hope that Parliament will soon have the authority to legislate on pensions .
No-one would benefit from this situation .
The policies of the European Union also have much to answer for in this situation .
Of course we need to modernise these systems .
We also need to reform archaic management methods which create injustices , chaos and waste .
Social protection should be based on the principle of national and Community preferences .
We are basically well disposed towards the European Union .
All other questions ought to be dealt with at local , regional or national levels .
The same applies to labour market policy .
We therefore view it with interest and hope and commend its intentions .
There are three main aspects that need to be highlighted .
The second concerns the management of welfare systems and those who operate them .
The third aspect concerns the principle of subsidiarity that underpins the European Union .
We are therefore voting against paragraph 7 of the report .
The report emphasises the social dimension of European cooperation , which is something to be welcomed .
Clarification of this kind is missing from the report , which is unfortunate .
That concludes the explanations of vote .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.55 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Next session of UN Human Rights Commission ( continuation )
In particular , we should be updating the areas where human rights need to be safeguarded .
Globalisation could easily come to be regarded as a harmful process .
We have already had three resolutions on the death penalty approved in Geneva .
China likes doublespeak .
Until we have a firm position , we will achieve nothing with the Chinese authorities .
I think we need to seize the opportunity .
We need to associate ourselves with the American initiative .
We need to table a strong text and that text needs to be adopted .
We need to work .
Mr President , I would like to try to put a different perspective to this .
Beyond the Milky Way there are 300 billion other galaxies with countless stars and planets .
What do they see ?
They see forests being cut down and deserts spreading .
How do they see the currently dominant species - that is us ?
Well , they see the planet 's resources being unevenly spread .
What do they see about the relationships between human beings ?
They see us killing each other .
They see us restricting each other 's liberties .
We all know the picture .
We should salute it - and I think we do .
Only in Europe are human rights enforceable in law .
I say : shame on them !
Human rights should be enforceable in law in every country of the world .
That is the goal which we have to work towards .
Much , as Commissioner Patten said , remains to be done .
Mr President , human rights are universal , indivisible , interrelated and interwoven .
That is positive .
Does it reflect this vision of coherence ?
In fact , does the European Union have a human rights policy ?
Such policy should comprise various components .
The Commission and the Council will each have to decide for themselves what these might be .
Mr President , this Parliament is fragmented and divided .
I do not know if he is still present and can hear me .
Especially in situations of war , civilians are given less consideration all the time .
It seems contradictory .
Never before in history has humanitarian right been so well developed .
Never before have so many international treaties been ratified by so many countries .
Women are systematically raped .
Children are conscripted by force and deployed in battle .
Excesses are no longer the exception , they have unfortunately become the rule .
This applies today to no fewer than thirty conflicts worldwide .
First of all , the policy comes too late .
Fifty years later , we are still unable to prevent genocide .
The human rights policy is also too selective .
But above all , the human rights policy is too fragmented .
Take Sudan .
The international community is sending conflicting messages to this country .
Britain has re-opened its embassy in Khartoum .
Canada has invited the Sudanese for peace talks .
The defamation of minorities in newspapers and other media fuels discrimination .
Quite frankly a hierarchy of oppression has been created .
We must not waiver in that commitment .
But we must also hold up the mirror to ourselves and recognise our own inadequacies .
Yes , conventions have been signed , but action is needed .
What happens in another part of the world affects us .
Pinochet in Chile is as relevant as Haider in Austria .
Human rights and civil liberties are inextricably linked .
Mr President , " Europe stands for ideals , values and principles .
We must emphasise Europe ' s spiritual history .
Together , we must re-establish the values which unite Europe .
Spiritual values have been disseminated from Europe throughout the globe .
We must live with our consciences . "
We should be grateful that there are Heads of State like Vaclav Havel in our Europe .
I wish to discuss two matters .
First of all , civil society .
It is happening with Buddhism in Tibet .
We must never forget to defend civil society .
I also want to mention the death penalty .
Try telling that to the governments of the United States , Russia and China .
It is a dictatorship and hence not a democracy .
The first country is Indonesia .
We are also pleased that the situation in Timor is slowly moving in the right direction .
This has claimed thousands of lives over the past two years .
Tens of thousands of people are on the run .
The situation is badly managed .
Surely we cannot just keep silent about Burma .
I have the feeling that that country is gradually being relegated to oblivion .
For ten years now , the elected President of that country has been under house arrest .
And for ten years now , its parliament has been out of action .
Numerous MPs have been killed or have fled the country and only a few are left in Burma .
My request is , in fact , to put this country back on the top of the agenda .
Justice needs to be done in Indonesia .
Justice needs to be done in East Timor .
President Wahid needs our support to cope with the difficult situation he is faced with .
This is an intolerable situation which must cease as a matter of urgency .
. Mr President , this has been a very useful debate .
How do we implement what the Treaties say in all those words about development assistance programmes ?
I think after her speech she will receive a cascade of letters from the Chinese authorities .
It has been a useful debate .
I hope we can have further debates like this .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday .
Cyprus and Malta
The next item is the joint debate on :
the Council statement on the position of the European Union on developments concerning Cyprus ;
Mr Seixas da Costa has the floor on behalf of the Council .
This is key as regards the future of this issue .
We believe that this has created the framework for a positive outcome .
In particular , we will make known the flexibility that both parties have demonstrated on this issue .
For example , I would not refer to the government of Nicosia .
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could explicitly confirm that .
In other words , accession should not be held hostage to a political solution .
The two processes are separate processes .
This unequivocal position on the part of the European Parliament gave rise to a certain degree of controversy .
The presence of these representatives will not prejudge the final political solution in any way whatsoever .
However , I also think that we in the EU should be making a constructive contribution .
There is , of course , the question of pre-accession aid , and this belongs in category seven .
This is the crux of the matter .
The international community has thus indicated that it rejects any act accomplished by force .
The big question , however , is from what budget heading should this aid be financed ?
The Council and Commission have suggested deleting the protocols under category 4 .
This is in line with the budget order issued by Parliament in December last .
The rapporteur is now making reference to this and proposes classing Cyprus and Malta under category 7 .
This is an extremely risky strategy .
In fact , the financial protocols cannot go ahead without a vote in Parliament .
I hope that the decisions taken at Helsinki lead to progress on the Cyprus issue .
I hope this signals a new era of hope for Cyprus .
I hope that Turkey begins to play a constructive role in the Cyprus issue .
I welcome the renewed warmth in relations between the Greek Government and the Turkish Government .
I hope that has an encouraging effect on the Cyprus talks .
Rather , the way in which these aid measures have been cobbled together smacks of amateurism to me .
This applies both in terms of the substance and the financial aspect .
As far as the citizens are concerned , it is what a regulation can do for them that matters .
We will not exactly win any awards with this regulation as far as that is concerned .
It is makeshift and contains heteronomous paragraphs , which is no way to set a shining example .
Both the Commission and the Council have been making very optimistic speeches here today as well .
I am delighted that we are all heading in the same direction in this respect .
I just want to ensure that there is no ambiguity .
Obviously , he said " the federal solution would be best " .
It is a most important point and needs to be clarified , Mr President .
Thank you very much for the clarification Mr Wurtz .
Mr President , Malta and Cyprus are very different from the countries of mainland Europe .
The Maltese in particular have been very good at surviving in hostile geographical and geopolitical environments .
Their success has relied in great part on their enterprise , their dynamism and their flexibility .
The EU should leave Cyprus and Malta alone .
This means that we are all aware of the political dimension of the Cyprus problem .
Helsinki was an historic event , an historic turning-point and an historic new reference point .
Conditions are ripe .
In any event , the outcome is in your hands .
Decisions have been taken by the Council with a great sense of responsibility .
We believe that Helsinki was very clear in this respect .
There is no point in second-guessing or trying to second-guess our intentions .
However , I would be more than pleased to elucidate a few points as requested .
Malta , Cyprus and Turkey were not provided for at this stage .
Mrs Schroedter described this as a lack of coherence .
I have had a little to do with this too .
Hitherto this has been out of the question of course .
The Commission and the Council have long endeavoured to encourage the two communities in Cyprus to undertake joint projects .
These will take place at a later date .
There would then be no question of Cyprus acceding to the Union .
Indeed that was the idea behind it .
Finally , of course , the Cyprus question has a role in the discussions with Turkey .
That is what we intend to do : the necessary measures and programmes are in place .
I feel that the criticism made of the previous presidency is not appropriate .
Thank you very much Commissioner Verheugen .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday .
Question Time ( Council )
Question No 1 by ( H-0022 / 00 ) :
There is a directive dating from 1995 on this subject .
There are also plans for a requirement to strengthen the actual structure of oil tankers visiting Community ports .
I am pleased that the Council is considering this question .
Of course , the story of the Erika seems comical .
This kind of situation should not be allowed .
However , we have to work within the existing legislative framework .
Question No 2 by ( H-0024 / 00 ) :
Even babies born when due tend to be underdeveloped .
I do not think that any of us has the least doubt about that .
We have to remember that we share responsibility in that region with the international community .
This is the basic issue underlying the present situation as a whole .
I would like to widen the debate and include the situation in Mitrovica .
This means that medical aid is still denied to the Albanian Kosovars .
But where will you place the emphasis ?
Mr Staes , the situation in Mitrovica is well known .
I perfectly understand Mr Staes ' s concerns .
Question No 3 by ( H-0027 / 00 ) :
Mr President , Mr Alavanos ' question naturally gives us food for thought on a wide range of issues .
Everyone is free to hold such views .
In my own country , the various parliamentary groups had differing views on this matter .
That was how it was .
This compulsory examination was to be carried out in line with accusations submitted .
Mr President , I believe Mr Alavanos is getting NATO and Mr Milosevic mixed up .
But I have a quite different question for the Council .
You mentioned before that we are on the brink of catastrophe there and nothing is being done .
Rapid action is called for !
As you know , the first steps were taken some months ago .
So we do not see eye to eye on how we view certain targets .
Question No 4 by ( H-0028 / 00 ) :
Has the time come for the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia ?
Mr President , I would like to thank the Representative of the Council Presidency for his answer .
Question No 6 by ( H-0122 / 00 ) :
We are therefore all to blame .
I would like to ask him a supplementary question in a wider context .
Mr President , I am no friend of Milosevic or his government .
It should not be defended even by those of us who deeply deplore the Milosevic regime .
That , however , is not my question .
My question is about political prisoners held in Serbia now .
There are , I believe , around 5 000 Kosovar political prisoners held in Serbia at the moment .
My question to the President-in-Office is twofold .
Firstly , is the Council fully aware of and concerned about the fate of these prisoners ?
Secondly , what does it propose to do about them ?
Mr MacCormick , first of all , I would like to answer your comments .
I did not defend attacks on civilians .
As I said , we are not making value judgements about specific actions .
Question No 7 by ( H-0035 / 00 ) :
Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda ?
What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes ?
What are the Council 's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union ?
This matter should form part of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
I do not know whether these proposals will meet with a favourable reception or not .
I therefore ask that both questions and answers be very brief .
Mr Rübig has the floor .
Both parties were once part of the government .
So far there have been no infringements of the law .
Are preventive sanctions reconcilable with the Charter of Human Rights ?
Is the call for violent demonstrations reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights ?
- ( PT ) The answer is neither yes nor no .
I do not know , Mr Martin . It will depend on the decision taken by the Council .
Question No 8 by ( H-0042 / 00 ) :
These can be used to distort competition and support questionable projects .
Will the EU take the lead in advancing this process ?
What is the Council 's view of the involvement of European governments and companies in this project ?
I ask this because of the issue of coherence , the subject of this morning ' s discussion .
- ( PT ) Mrs Lucas , I was not present at the debate you are referring to .
Question No 9 by ( H-0044 / 00 ) :
This is indeed also stipulated in Article 248 .
The Court of Auditors , therefore , already has all the instruments necessary to carry out its role .
It is extremely important .
Their reports are extremely detailed and very important .
This is the way to ensure that such conflicts are avoided in the future .
The Commission will have to provide specific answers to these questions .
Question No 10 by ( H-0053 / 00 ) :
Will the Portuguese Presidency clarify its position on this matter ?
We are therefore in perfect and total agreement in our concern to achieve a positive outcome on this matter .
This has , from the outset , been the position of the Portuguese Presidency .
That is my first question .
We are in the midst of rather sensitive negotiations .
This has an impact of course , because it is read by other members of the Council .
I am therefore perfectly aware of this problem .
How do you think a system like that would affect people ' s confidence in ourselves as politicians ?
However , if you wish to enter into the realms of philosophy , go ahead !
. Mr President , I have no desire to enter into the realms of philosophy .
I would ask you to allow me to refrain from commenting on this matter .
That concludes Questions to the Council .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
Address by Mr Vaclav Havel , President of the Czech Republic
I should also like to welcome Mrs Havel , who is sitting in the gallery .
You are most welcome .
( Applause )
This is not your first visit to our Parliament , Mr President .
The end of this artificial separation of Europe marked the start of a new era .
We now face an historical challenge with multiple prospects for all the citizens of Europe .
Mr President , you are a symbol of these changes .
But you never lost hope and history proved you right .
Ten years ago , the " velvet revolution " proclaimed Havel na HRAD .
You are a first class European .
Today , the Czech Republic is preparing to join our Union .
It has already taken a big step forward with Agenda 2000 .
Mr President , it gives me great pleasure to give you the floor .
( Applause )
I have taken note of your words ; this is something which we all feel very deeply .
We of course look forward most keenly to continuing this task with you .
Thank you , Mr President .
( The formal sitting was closed at 12.40 p.m. )
ACP-EU Joint Assembly
In many ways this was the end of an old era and the start of a new one .
The ACP-EU Joint Assembly is a unique organisation in world politics .
Where else do 86 nations come together to discuss matters of mutual concern ?
The Strasbourg Assembly was the last chaired by Lord Plumb .
I pay special tribute to him for his success .
The main thrust of our work in both Assemblies was poverty eradication .
We had , as usual , many debates on countries where there are war situations .
I visited Ethiopia and Eritrea to gain first-hand knowledge .
The OAU is doing its best to broker a peace deal there .
In Nassau , we had two interesting debates on East Timor and Cuba .
I await with interest developments in Cuba .
We must give them all our support to reach that goal .
This I think is the new Convention .
These assemblies would report back to the Joint Assembly .
We are going to have one in Abuja in West Africa too .
I want to see civil society given a louder voice .
I am delighted to see the result in Zimbabwe .
European taxpayers will no longer accept their taxes being fraudulently used .
A new wind of change must blow through Africa and new standards must be set and lived up to .
I beg to move acceptance of this report .
Congratulations on your maiden speech : It went really well .
So I do not want to look back only to the year 1999 .
The rapporteur , Mr Corrie , has already done so most expertly .
The after-shocks can still be felt .
ACP cooperation is a dynamic process .
That also means strengthening the democratic institutions .
The history of the Joint Assembly provides impressive evidence of a positive trend in that direction .
One special aspect of multilateral cooperation with the ACP states is regional cooperation and integration .
Mr President , I congratulate Mr Corrie on his report .
That reflects the growth of inequality between EU and ACP countries .
After all , who protects these deeply corrupt regimes , if not the governments of the rich countries ?
That is important , for at least three reasons .
Of course , Cuba must meet all the standard conditions , just like any other member .
The Cubans know that and I am sure they accept it .
We must put a stop to this trend .
We must begin by writing off debts . We must follow up words with action .
I should like us to take a leading role in this work .
I think that is a very good idea indeed , and I fully subscribe to it .
However , we must also ask ourselves about our own democratic arrangements .
How do these operate within the European Parliament ' s delegation to the ACP-EU ' s Joint Assembly ?
The challenge was immense .
These regional assemblies would monitor action in their respective areas .
Consistency and action are needed .
The participation of local bodies is absolutely essential .
We need to make progress with concrete and consistent action .
People in the poor countries are beginning to despair .
Mrs Lucas mentioned that the Stabex and Sysmin system ought to be continued with .
I do not agree .
It is the applicants themselves who are to decide whether they want to knock on the door .
Once they have done so , we shall adopt a position on the matter .
This would in fact demand a change to the recently adopted Amsterdam Treaty .
Finally , I would refer to the South Africa agreement , which the rapporteur also touched upon .
So the " Grappa War " is over .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Stabilisation and association agreement with FYROM
The Commission is proposing that we should conclude an agreement jointly with the Council .
Firstly , there is the regional approach .
I believe that if it is understood properly , the regional approach is both important and necessary .
There has to be a willingness to cooperate .
I think Commissioner Patten understands that too .
So I very strongly urge him to make it clear in the appropriate talks .
I was unaccustomed to hearing this type of comment about the Roma in Europe .
With regard to the problems afflicting Macedonia , higher education for the Albanian-speaking citizens deserves our special attention .
I might never have studied otherwise .
It would be beneficial if we could reorganise this , especially vis-à-vis the neighbouring states .
It is only fair that we should regulate aid to Macedonia properly now .
I would quote the PHARE programme as an example .
It will not do to keep us under constant pressure .
And there are several reasons why our opinion can only be positive .
With this in mind , we have presented some amendments which I hope Parliament will accept .
Mr President , Commissioner , the war in Kosovo has knocked everything off balance .
This is certainly true for the relations between the European Union and the western Balkans .
Since then , expectations have been high .
This applies to them and us .
Is there any prospect of membership ?
This is very much on their minds .
But here too , within the European Union , expectations are high .
Can we , based on the experiences in Macedonia and in four other countries , improve on this ?
This is not the Union ' s only contribution .
We are now dealing with the stabilisation and association agreements , that is to say a medium-term issue .
I am convinced that the four other countries are wondering what is going to happen .
What does the European Union intend to do with Macedonia ?
Will it do the same to us ?
This first step is so important because of this model function .
Macedonia also serves as a model for another reason .
The rapporteur has already hinted at this in no uncertain terms , namely , the issue of interethnic relations .
There is no need to paint too much of an idealistic picture .
This model function also applies to regional cooperation .
If we mess it up , then we will have lost a great deal more .
I am referring to the sanctions against Yugoslavia .
This agreement can and must become an example to the other countries in the region .
That is why it is so important .
I think this report is a small masterpiece of hypocrisy .
Paragraph 5 holds up this agreement as an example .
This question needs to be resolved urgently .
Why has the Council not informed us of this ?
Why has the Commission not informed us of this formal request from Macedonia ?
The decidedly positive developments in the Republic of Macedonia over the past critical years speak for themselves .
The gruesome escalation of ethnic violence in neighbouring Kosovo did not reach its territory .
What we are doing here is not hypocritical .
We have reached a propitious moment and I think the Macedonians are glad about it .
Please stop being so unpleasant and pouring cold water on everything .
I think we should take a more positive approach here .
Macedonia did not go through a war .
It suffered enormously from the influx of refugees during the Kosovo war .
I think Mr Swoboda has drafted an excellent report , and it has my wholehearted support .
Mr President , I too would like to compliment Mr Swoboda on his report .
This marks the beginning of the treaty-based stabilising process for the countries of the former Yugoslavia .
These countries do not yet qualify for a pre-accession agreement .
Macedonia remains a potential minefield and has a history to match .
It does , however , have the ambition to break free from this image .
This requires internal stability .
We , the social democrats , would urge the opposition to back these ideas .
They need to help support the much-praised Macedonian model .
But the country also - and especially - needs external stability .
What is the point of having internal stability if the surrounding environment is unstable ?
This stability is required in the relations with Yugoslavia , Kosovo , Albania and Bulgaria .
The region should recognise that Macedonia exists and that it will continue to exist .
External stability also means open borders and regional cooperation .
Minorities and majorities need to be given room for human and cultural exchange .
Macedonia ' s stability is very much linked with the developments in the neighbouring countries .
The Kosovo problem is well-known and the international community is present there on a massive scale .
It seems that the Albania factor is being underestimated .
But what then instead ?
What does the Commission intend to do regarding this issue ?
We need to wait and see what happens there .
The mood in Belgrade is becoming less predictable by the day .
We , however , second the Council ' s decision to give the sanctions a different focus .
What else can we do to support this opposition ?
We should do exactly the same for the other countries in the Balkans .
This is an urgent duty for the EU .
I am talking about Milosevic .
All this , in exchange for the promise of future accession to the European Union .
For about 10 years , the situation in the area has been fluid .
Under those conditions , then , there has been a real failure .
I say this just so that we know where we stand .
. This has been a very interesting general debate about the Balkans as a whole .
I am delighted to be able to be able to set out the Commission 's position on the report .
It is very helpful .
It is an excellent contribution by Mr Swoboda and his colleagues .
I am very pleased that at our overall relations with FYROM are in such a good state .
That has been helped by our excellent European Union representative in the country .
He has been a great friend to Parliament and a great servant of the Commission .
So to is the cooperation of FYROM in the rebuilding of Kosovo .
Let me make clear the main elements of those draft directives .
They cover the inclusion in the agreement of arrangements establishing a political dialogue with FYROM .
I am due to visit FYROM in the second week in March .
I should like to comment very briefly on a number of other points in the draft resolution .
That has never been the intention .
I note with considerable concern what Members say on this score .
I hope that the other countries of the region will redouble their efforts to make similar progress .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Patten .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.
Agreement on comitology
Therefore , the agreement contains explicit provisions on urgent procedure , including possible action by the committee responsible .
It makes them think of secret societies and conspiracies , which is the way things used to be .
The procedures for exercising these implementing powers take the form of a limited number of committee procedures .
On the contrary , for a long time even the European Parliament was not informed .
Agreement was reached in 1988 in the form of an exchange of letters between Lord Plumb and Mr Delors .
It also gave it the possibility of scrutiny .
A key problem is the time factor .
I just have one more request .
The German version is not very clear here .
I would ask for that to be checked again .
For the rest , I warmly thank our rapporteur .
Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur on her report .
Let us remember what is at stake here .
Firstly , the whole system is obscure .
Here is a real step forward , in the new system that has been agreed .
We are to know who is on each committee .
We are to know when they meet .
We are to get the agendas .
We are to get the documents that are sent to them .
The whole system will be more open and transparent - if still rather complex .
So that is at least a step forward .
Our second criticism is that the system was very restrictive of the Commission .
We adopt legislation in the European Union .
We expect the Commission to implement it .
Here too there is at least some progress .
That is a more reasonable system .
That , too , is a step forward .
But on our other two criticisms , we are less satisfied .
The legislative authority , Council and Parliament , should be equal .
Parliament has no equivalent power .
True , we are now given the beginning of such a power in this new system .
We will have the chance to scrutinise , to debate , to question .
And in a democracy , Parliament should be able to challenge the content .
Not that we do so every week .
That is not correct .
Overall we have a system which has made some progress .
We have been willing to relinquish the provisions in that .
We must be very vigilant .
So it is a step forward .
My group reluctantly accepts it as a step forward .
We are not as enthusiastic about compromising as Mrs Frassoni .
Mr President , first I want to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Frassoni , for her work .
It is never easy working on comitology .
Mrs Schleicher referred to a kind of committee magic , something we have long talked about .
From our point of view , it satisfies the fundamental interests of Parliament .
Mr Corbett set out Parliament ' s concerns .
He says some of them have been satisfied and others have not .
I would say the ones the Commission was able to satisfy have been satisfied .
So how far have we come ?
This will facilitate two activities Parliament is especially interested in .
I think this is a good agreement .
It is a good agreement which undoubtedly improves the transparency of the process .
From here on things are going to be easier .
We have made a start , and we hope the work will produce some excellent results .
We think there are other positive advances too .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Solbes Mira .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.
Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure
These changes may of course alter the government deficits in terms of the Member States ' national accounting .
We have already heard about the various aspects involved .
What I think is crucial is that henceforth the statistical data will be more reliable and comparable .
It is important to adjust the procedure for two reasons .
Firstly , for the single market .
Secondly , for economic and monetary union .
It is good that the procedure exists .
We need it because it lends our criteria the necessary seriousness and credibility .
The citizens ask what happens if the criteria are not met .
It also inspires a few political comments .
The Stability Pact is a given in Europe .
The stronger the position of the participating countries , the stronger the euro will be .
This is the theory behind it , anyway .
We have always been of the opinion that these criteria should be stringently met .
Various Member States have taken one-off measures to be able to meet the criteria .
A drop in standards should not be allowed .
Indeed , we still have not managed to stop passing on the burden to future generations .
I just mention that to complete the view of the process .
Secondly , I would like to thank Mr Knörr for his speediness .
He has done really good work in a very short time .
This is an important subject for certain references which we have heard subsequently .
That being so , I believe the final result will be better .
This regulation is purely instrumental .
It does deal with the substance of the problem some of you have raised .
But we do need to think about how we deal with the substance of the problem .
But we see no reason to lower our guard .
We must press on in that direction because we know it is vital .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Solbes Mira .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.
Increasing penal sanctions against counterfeiting of the euro
We cannot permit our common currency to become weaker through its being counterfeited .
This is something which Parliament has said it wants to see added .
A country which acted in that way would bring a lot of ill will upon itself .
On 1 January 2002 the euro will be in circulation .
Quite simply , we are to have a minimum level for the maximum penalty .
The denominations of the euro are well known .
The new applicant States are also encouraged to adapt to these regulations .
It has taken two years for the Council and the Commission to produce this proposal .
It is essential that the decision should now be taken in March .
To delay , or perhaps even risk damage to the euro , would be indefensible .
The Council must now convene in March and make the relevant decision .
Thank you for listening .
It is easy to counterfeit the euro .
It is a highly complex problem .
Let me say in passing that this may seem an attractive prospect for a number of people .
So what is the European Union doing about it ?
This framework decision does without any doubt represent some progress .
Thank you for your attention during our night sitting together .
Mr President , the launch of the euro could well be a heaven-sent opportunity for counterfeiters .
That is what I would have preferred , personally .
However , I find these passports inadequate .
Counterfeiting is not on the list .
So we come back to the previous problem .
In other words , the Council has not succeeded in giving this text a credible legal basis .
I would also like to make a more general point .
But there has been nothing for a year .
Just a few little technical reports like this one on counterfeiting .
However , there are many underlying problems yet to be resolved .
Mr President , for those unfortunate investors even real euros are false money .
These are gigantic problems but they seem to be taboo here .
I should like to take over the baton from the previous speaker .
In my view , this exceeds the parameters of the legal basis .
We have all noted that the conversion phase will bring uncertainty and risks with it .
We are also concerned with the question of cooperation .
Aside from the report , which we welcome , many questions have arisen that still need to be resolved .
I hope the debate we are holding here will bring some clarification .
That is , after all , a question the people often ask .
They will need time to get used to that too .
And that is what we are discussing at this late hour .
But that cannot be helped .
Of course , the European Central Bank has been looking into the matter for a very long time .
After all , it is responsible for technical measures to protect against counterfeiting .
That is what this framework decision is about .
I certainly appreciate that .
The framework decision will , however , have to be supplemented by other legal acts in future .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Schreyer .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.
( The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m. )
Resumption of the sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
( The Minutes were approved )
The issue of UCITS may appear difficult , technical and a political minefield .
I believe that some people do not even know what UCITS stands for .
Collective investment undertakings became an alternative to saving with a bank .
In my own country , more than 60 per cent of Swedes save with a variety of funds .
The capital and securities market has continued to be developed .
The current Directive on UCITS has become antiquated and outdated .
The Commission ' s proposal with which we are dealing today is in two parts .
The first concerns the product , that is to say the funds .
The other concerns the collective investment undertakings .
The committee wishes to make the requirements in relation to the Commission ' s proposal more stringent .
In addition , quantitative criteria ( risk exposure ) should be introduced .
They are very important in this case .
They must be introduced to guarantee the protection of investors .
A crucial point is that rules are proposed for so-called simplified prospectuses .
In this regard , too , the committee is prepared to go further than the Commission .
There are different views on this .
The current situation is not good .
Both savers and the industry need modernised regulations for the whole of Europe .
There is little disagreement amongst Members with regard to the first proposal .
However , it is in relation to the second proposal that there is most concern .
I have a number of ideas which should be put across .
It seems unusual that we failed to grasp that opportunity .
We will have to revisit this issue again in the near future .
We have achieved a compromise solution .
We have achieved an acceptable compromise solution on this , or so we believe , which I welcome .
But the world of international finance is a dangerous one .
The capital markets are still at the mercy of their excesses .
There is at present a surfeit of cash looking for a home .
And as international financial activity speeds up , the risks increase .
By definition , investment funds use other people ' s money .
The legislator should protect the general interest and introduce safeguard clauses .
There is no freedom without rules .
We have done away with so-called master-feeder structures .
The European market is still fragmented and such structures would doubtless cause problems .
Mr President , there is much talk at present of the principle of good governance .
Is this speculative ?
Not at all .
In exchange , you might also have given up some of the upside of the markets .
That is a desirable development in a soundly managed fund .
History demonstrates that investors benefit from a liberal and light-handed approach to regulation .
These are of course the returns after deducting all losses .
This is what we should be concerned about here today .
We do not , in principle , oppose this industry .
But we make no bones about the fact that we shall vote against the text as a whole .
They even reject the strict minimum , i.e. the Monti package proposed by the Commission in Brussels .
We must put an end to this .
This brings us to the two proposals for directives .
The second proposal , on which the report is excellent , does not require any particular comment .
It aims to strengthen consumer protection and security .
The same cannot be said of the first proposal .
There is , of course , no reciprocity in favour of European UCITS .
We shall also vote against the abolition of the facility for the Member States to increase to 35 % ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , this is a vital issue for Europe .
I welcome many of the developments which Mr Schmidt ' s report brings us .
UCITS are a success story within the European Union .
They are a safe product , traded cross-border .
But it is time for the legislation to be updated .
Mr Schmidt has done an excellent job here .
I appeal to everyone here to evaluate the products which will be used by UCITS .
We must not be afraid to go forward , to react to changes in the market .
Yes , we need to continue to ensure that UCITS provide a balanced and protected product for consumers .
The report gives very adequate protection for consumers .
I salute Mr Schmidt .
Thank you very much Mr Kuckelkorn .
The Commission proposals being debated here will give it the face-lift it needs .
In addition , investors often have better protection with an actively-managed fund .
My Amendment No 47 is therefore a warning for amateurs .
I shall therefore vote against this proposed amendment .
And the more consumers invest , the brighter the prospects will be in the European business money markets .
However , I would like to express my position with regard to a few detailed proposals .
Mr President , I see two problems with this morning ' s debate .
Firstly , I welcome proposal No 1 .
It simplifies things and brings things up to date .
We believe that a more liberal market is the best way forward .
Secondly , we consider proposal No 2 to be very confused .
We ask the Commission to look again at these proposals .
Mr President , money does not smell , as the Romans would say .
The important thing is for money to generate more money .
The two proposals form a coherent whole .
I can also accept the idea in the second proposed paragraph of Amendment No 47 .
All the amendments I have listed so far pertain to the first proposal .
The Commission has suggested adopting the content of these , with certain changes in the wording .
However , I cannot accept the wording of the consideration as it stands .
This is why the Commission regrets that it is unable to accept the following amendments to the first proposal :
We cannot , therefore , adopt the proposed Amendment for this reason .
Amendment No 35 cannot be accepted because legally , it cannot command any authority .
So what Mr Huhne wants is already possible .
A question has been put by Mrs Villiers who referred to enhancing portfolio management .
That is the reason why the Commission has put forward these two separate proposals .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
Mutual assistance in criminal matters between the Member States
Some of these differences have already been ironed out , but others persist .
I should like to draw attention to the fact that the Council is not present today .
I condemn this , as well as the Council ' s absence .
These are serious matters on which this House must act .
A political community is reflected in the justice which it hands out .
This is why this report is so important .
The regulation of phone tapping in the Council document was incomplete and therefore inadequate .
Mr Schulz should be aware of this .
The European Parliament is certainly not to blame for this .
It is the governments of the Member States who have restricted the amount of leeway to this degree .
As a result , the European Parliament is faced with an almost impossible task .
If not , we will be fighting a running battle .
In my opinion , this is the only way to fight crime effectively across all Member States .
Hence , it is extremely important that this condition of accrual be adopted .
In the words of rapporteur Mr Di Pietro , the proposal even contains colossal shortcomings .
There are certainly no restrictions in its scope .
As such , the agreement applies not only to fighting serious crimes and organised crime .
In fact , it is not written anywhere that it is restricted to criminal law .
In my Group , there are undoubtedly different views of Mr Di Pietro ' s report .
There are two reasons why we are saying no .
The overall result is remarkable and I hope that the Council will fully take it into account .
This is a highly controversial issue as it constitutes a potential source of abuse .
This is a distant goal , but is one that can be attained in stages .
It points out some of the serious flaws in this proposal .
The lack of clarity of language is inevitably going to lead to legal uncertainty .
Legal certainty is something that is essential in such crucial matters .
Not only should this be deleted , the whole interception title should be scrapped .
Furthermore , in this proposal there is no threshold for serious offences .
This leaves it wide open to abuse .
That is not guaranteed .
This issue is extremely serious .
In that sense , the issues of judicial cooperation in matters of criminal law are important .
What did I understand on reading the related texts ?
That it is dangerous to rely on the provisions made by the Council .
How can there be any cooperation on criminal matters on that basis ?
Today , thanks to the complex networks of sexual deviants , he is in Portugal .
Mr President , this agreement deals with a sensitive issue : cooperation in the field of criminal law .
It is therefore understandable that the Council finds it difficult to agree .
Successful application of this agreement by the Member States requires unanimity within the Council .
Only a broadly based agreement makes any sense in practice .
This , however , does not mean that the Council can work on this anonymously .
Quite the reverse , in fact .
The procedural aspect of the legal system must be respected by defending the rights ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Is one secure when freedoms are no longer guaranteed ?
Is one free when security is no longer assured ?
And this dialogue is open-ended ; it adapts to the demands of the day .
But the Council ' s draft leaves a lot to be desired and attracts criticism on several counts .
It is not just a question of style .
We are taking about criminal law here and criminal law has to be interpreted by the letter .
I should like to stress this point because it is paramount .
It is nothing less than legal torture .
Other European countries , on the other hand , do not accept confession as sufficient proof of guilt .
I thus believe that Mr Schulz could have spared himself the effort of making certain remarks .
We need hard and fast rules .
Most say it is about time .
This Convention will not create a new or different system of Mutual Assistance .
Furthermore , requests can be made directly between the competent authorities without any need to go via central authorities .
We must recognise that Article 18 concerns what is clearly a controversial decision .
However , we must be realistic .
Goebbels ( PSE ) .
The words ' issued by ' also need to be added after the words ' transferable securities ' .
It is not the establishments but the instruments which should have a high rating .
My apologies once again for my mistake .
Are there any objections to this oral amendment ?
( Parliament adopted the oral amendment )
( Parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions in two separate votes )
I was told that this was a personal response .
Note will be taken of it in the Minutes .
I see that Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso is asking to take the floor on the same subject .
We are not going to enter into a debate now .
I shall give you the floor for any points of order after the vote .
Relating to Amendments Nos 22 and 24

Before the vote
Madam President , I want to condemn the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council .
It rather seems like a contradiction in terms .
However , in the Spanish version the ' abogado ' has disappeared completely .
We shall address this problem and check all the translations .

Very well , I shall do so .

Relating to Amendment No 6
I hope the person who tabled the amendment will agree to this .
This clarification would certainly meet with our approval .
Are there any objections to the inclusion of this oral amendment ?
( Parliament agreed to the oral amendment ) - Relating to Amendment No 9
Absolutely , I do not think that will pose a problem .

Report by Olle Schmidt ( A5-0025 / 2000 )
Brok report ( A5-0029 / 2000 )
We have before us Malta and Cyprus , which are two States keen to become members .
Both countries also qualify for financial aid under the MEDA programme ( B7-4012 ) .
This proposal for a regulation is supposed to be one of these legal bases !

The Union should use every means at its disposal to guard against counterfeiting .
This is a basic element of the decision .

Di Pietro report ( A5-0019 / 2000 )
This Convention will lead to gross abuses of people ' s rights to privacy .
It is a major threat to civil liberties in EU .
Resolution on the Commission ' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005
In Zambia 25 % of teachers have died of AIDS .
Our policies in Africa lack coherence .
There is huge duplication of effort .
Furthermore , the cloud of debt remains an obstacle to real development .
It is patently clear that Africa has become the forgotten continent .
What should this global actor ' s objective be ?
And yet this phrase is nowhere to be seen .
The omission of this principal objective is highly revealing .
How strange that the Commission should lose its instinct for self-preservation just as Europe is integrating .
. ( FR ) I share the overriding sense of deep and keen dissatisfaction expressed during the debate .
And yet our President is a fine economist .
For this very reason , we cannot agree to cut pensions further .
What is more , the relevant cost dynamic is completely under control .
( FR ) The European Union is flaunting its unbridled expansionist ambitions .
The nature of the EU has not changed .
We abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution for the following reasons .
Corrie report ( A5-0032 / 2000 )
The cooperation agreement with South Africa is a prime example .
The new agreement provides for a development budget of EUR 13.5 billion over the next seven years .
Strenuous efforts must be made to root out corruption and waste .
Civil society must be involved in the planning and implementation of these projects .
80 % of the 13.9 million AIDS related deaths in the world have taken place in this region .
It is clear that the spread of AIDS in the sub-Saharan African Continent is linked to poverty .
Prevention education should begin early in the primary school curriculum in these countries .
Already weak economies are being further weakened in Africa by the AIDS virus .
Already stretched resources are being further stretched .
It is the humane face of Europe ...
Especially as the vulnerable architecture of this ambitious structure has been threatened .
It should seal their revival .
The partnership is here to stay and the way is clear for it to be modernised .
Or on Shell ?
The Labour Government ' s record in Britain is also a proud one .
There is still much to be done , however .
Developing countries want trade not aid , a help up not a hand-out .
Swoboda report ( A5-0031 / 2000 )

Frassoni Report ( A5-0021 / 2000 )
( The sitting was suspended at 1.23 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Company restructuring in Europe
The next item is the Commission statement - Company restructuring in Europe .
Sometimes this calls for mergers of activities .
In other cases these operations were launched and implemented with less care and concern for those affected .
Firstly , decisions on corporate restructuring remain the prerogative as well as the responsibility of management .
This requires anticipation , timely preparation and careful management of these processes .
These basic ideas meet with a wide consensus in Europe .
This is what intelligent restructuring is about .
The Commission will contact the relevant national authorities to check this .
Action is not limited to legislation .
We are also developing another suggestion of that expert group , the Managing Change Report .
Let me finish by addressing some of the other concerns expressed in the draft resolution submitted to this House .
Thank you very much Commissioner .
Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso , I understand you have a point of order .
This partisan behaviour of our President should be criticised most firmly .
I will willingly accept Madam President ' s apologies any time .
Thank you for your statement .
We will certainly make sure that the President is informed of your statement .
Therefore the House was probably quite willing to go ahead at that stage .
But thank you for your remarks .
The subject in question is of great political and social importance .
Commissioner Liikanen , we expect an authoritative intervention .
Our task is to draft legislation and to monitor to ensure that it is observed .
The company went under despite this .
This goes to show that jobs cannot be bought .
The market is a law unto itself .
A company is pilloried one day and not the next .
Why should this be the case ?
Michelin caused a great stir .
This is why the Liberal Group will vote against paragraph 8 and the second section of paragraph 9 .
If these paragraphs are nonetheless adopted , my Group will abstain from the final vote .
I do hope that this will not be necessary .
This is just an underhand way of making workers redundant .
Mr President , sadly , once again , Parliament is having to discuss the restructuring of companies in Europe .
Yet again , workers are likely to lose their jobs .
This time , I am referring to the workers of the company Goodyear in Cisterna di Latina .
I , like all Members present , am saddened by this loss of jobs .
We need multinational companies to base their businesses within our continent .
We need to gain an insight into what companies are like now .
What is more , the Portuguese Presidency sees the fight against unemployment as top priority .
Yet , all too often these political priorities are invisible in everyday policies .
This global restructuring plan could lead to the loss of up to 12 000 jobs .
I do not think it is simply a matter of a Community charter .
EU legislation on this issue could not be clearer .
We need more joined-up policy making on these issues .
This is the only way of respecting Article 127 of the Treaty .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will be taken later this evening .
The sitting was suspended at 3.50 p.m. and resumed at 4.05 p.m.
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
Racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido ( Spain )
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
We should be tackling the issue of immigration in a comprehensive and rigorous manner .
Today ' s problems cannot be solved in five years .
They will take a long time , as we are finding out .
Legal immigrants must be integrated socially without any excuses or delays .
We all regret the deaths which have occurred and the violent and disproportionate reactions against the immigrant workers .
Yet it is not enough to regret the situation .
We do not want Africa to become our cross , in fact quite the contrary .
We must therefore act .
Firstly we are creating a network of reception centres for minors .
Secondly we are conducting a programme of social integration .
Thirdly we are carrying out education programmes on tolerance and respect .
Finally we are producing a census of immigrants .
We are all immigrants .
For you , the south is Andalusia but for us Andalusians it is Africa .
These events have also acted as a wake-up call to our consciences .
Employers would be lost without immigrants .
Working conditions are so hard and so deplorable that no Spaniard will accept them .
For four days , the immigrants were collectively hounded .
Women and children were beaten .
We all have a duty to put our own house in order .
Everywhere this violence is exacerbated by the spread of extremist movements .
That is my conclusion today .
Because this witch hunt which broke out in the province of Almería should have been foreseen .
This precarious wage-earning position weakens these immigrants and their families and makes them vulnerable .
It just remains for me to urge you all to attend the demonstration on Saturday .
We express our support for the families and friends of the victims .
President Prodi and Commissioner Diamantopoulou have both issued separate statements .
Naturally I completely endorse what they have said .
This proposal is under examination by the Council and the European Parliament .
The Commission hopes very much that this stage will soon be complete .
The European Council also considered it important to step up the prevention of illegal immigration .
Those who organise illegal immigration should be prosecuted with the utmost vigour .
Those rights are , by definition , universal .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 6 p.m.
Indeed , it is not the first time that we will be debating Kosovo here .
I very much appreciate it that the Commission always attends .
I certainly appreciate the fact that Commissioner Patten is present , given his powers .
We need to cooperate with the Council too .
I think we should give this some thought .
I would request you to pass this complaint on to the Bureau of Parliament .
The other reason is that this text does not , unfortunately , go very far .
You condemn the first direct attack on the KFOR troops .
Mr President , what is happening in Mitrovica in Kosovo is appalling and reprehensible .
Violence begets violence , and revenge begets revenge .
The police forces which have been sent out do not have the manpower to stop what is going on .
He has fewer than 2 000 officers , and it was agreed that there should be nearly 5 000 .
I was in Kosovo on 27 October 1998 when the Serbs withdrew .
After a month , however , there was still only a handful of observers .
Atrocities were not even being recorded .
Then the war came , and the observers were withdrawn .
I might also ask : when do you anticipate that they will be in place ?
And when is more responsibility to be transferred to local democratic authorities ?
In this sense , I am in agreement with Mr Sakellariou ' s proposals .
Flora defended herself , and asked Serbs and Albanians to shake hands .
Flora Brovina ' s husband is the guest of Serbian women in Belgrade .
It is not true that Flora Brovina has been abandoned .
I believe that the European Union must do likewise .
What she has said here is completely justified .
There is not one truth in Kosovo , there are several .
I completely concur with the draft resolution which is before us .
Needless to say , the situation in Mitrovica is very dangerous and we all know why .
We have already talked about the fate of the political prisoners .
There is a great deal of pain , a lot of suffering in Kosovo .
The people are holding demonstrations , they are sending us e-mails .
They ask us where their children are , their sons .
We need to be able to go back with a proper answer .
The case of Flora Brovina is just one of many .
I would ask the Commission and the absent Council at long last to do something for these political prisoners .
The fact that they are locked up in Serbia also fuels the unrest and violence in Kosovo .
The UN , however , have pledged to dispatch a police force of 4 800 .
To date , however , Mr Kouchner only has about 2 000 police troops at his disposal .
Moreover , half of this group is from the United States and Germany .
Press freedom in Angola
It would be the first in a long time .
So I welcome it as such .
Mr President , how much longer can we continue our cooperation with Angola ?
The legal proceedings against the journalists fly in the face of every legal principle .
Additionally , European observers will need to be admitted to the trials against the journalists .
If the Angolan Government continues to refuse to cooperate , measures will need to be taken .
Without national reconciliation , reconciliation with Europe is not possible .
This being the case , Angola will unfortunately remain a very rough diamond .
Yet this is not the situation .
Angola does not enjoy rule of law . It is a repressive dictatorship .
It is at war , and a bloody war at that , which is dragging on and on .
These cases keep occurring .
Yet the worst part is that there is no way out of the situation in Angola .
This war must be stopped .
It is clear that such a scenario will never allow peace to be established in Angola .
The people of Angola deserve better .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it seems as if the world is turned upside down .
This is Angola ' s reality .
We are now expressing our horror concerning this war .
We would , at the same time , like to insist on other things .
But what do these sanctions mean ?
It is the western world itself which is partly to blame .
It is we , our own people , who keep the war going over there .
The so-called civilised world should hang its head in shame .
Mr President , we are partly to blame for this war .
Mr President , the facts are well-known .
The journalist had brought to light a corruption scandal in the President ' s cabinet .
The trial took place behind closed doors and the defendant was only allowed one witness .
There is indeed a great deal of hypocrisy regarding Angola .
In my opinion , Angola is a test case .
We should , at any rate , judge the Portuguese Presidency on its actions and not on its words .
Native Americans in the US - Dineh
We have to admit that our European sense of responsibility is no more developed in this respect .
Once again , an indigenous people ' s right of existence is being threatened .
But if we are to believe the environmental movements , even this is vain hope .
The credibility of the industrialised north is at stake .
This is about the repression of a minority which unfortunately goes back a long time .
So we need to do this .
It is important to point this out .
We have just approved the water directive here in Parliament .
The forced relocation scheme must be stopped unconditionally .
People should no longer be forced to move .
If people need to move at all , they need to be given a viable alternative .
This is not the case here .
The account of the Dineh Indians is telling .
It is now the intention to send the last 4 000 Dineh Indians to this land .
This too is characteristic of American society , which hears little about it .
There are few of them left and they are up against a very powerful , economic adversary .
The Dineh people belong to the North-American Navajo Indians .
They are facing expulsion and have been fighting a battle of survival for dozens of years .
They have been living in harrowing living conditions for years .
The Relocation Act was pushed through in Congress by a group representing the coal mining industry .
The population was not allowed any input .
This resembles a kind of trade in human beings .
The relocation scheme was implemented and the Dineh people were moved to an area contaminated by uranium .
It is high time we respected the rights of the Indians .
So let us contact the United States now !
Citizens are believed to have been burnt alive in air-raid shelters .
We insist that these violations of human rights are investigated .
Mr President , a journalist is on a fact-finding mission and this calls for freedom .
Yet he is taken hostage and treated as a prisoner of war .
The war in Chechnya , like any war , is a trail of horrors .
And just what is Mr CFSP doing ?
What are we doing about it ?
I beg you to intervene .
The entire Federation is allowing itself to be taken in by the war propaganda .
I can only reiterate my appeal to the Council and the Commission to stick to the rules .
This distressing ambiguity on the part of the Kremlin is not really surprising .
The facts are clear .
Andrey Babitsky was an unwanted busybody in Mr Putin ' s ' anti-terrorist ' operation in Chechnya .
Hence his disappearance of over one month .
Nor is it a mere luxury .
These papers actively support the opposition politician , Mr Sam Rengie .
This is notably the only party in Cambodia which has no military arm .
The pattern of intimidation is clear .
All this is happening on a daily basis .
It is true , the civil war in Cambodia is over and political tension has eased .
At the same time , the struggle against impunity is under threat .
In particular we support the development of a free , democratic and multi-ethnic society .
It was a point raised by several speakers in the debate .
We continue to be very concerned about the many civilians who are presently held in Serb prisons .
The plight of Kosovar Albanians who have been missing since the end of the war is particularly distressing .
It is a vital precondition for strengthening democratic institutions and civil society .
This is a subject which is not given sufficient attention .
There are alarming reports of human rights violations .
Of course , there has been disproportionate use of force in the present conflict .
We await a proper response from the Russians .
I totally agree with the arguments that were put forward by Mr Morillon .
At the same time , we welcome the continued dialogue between the two parties .
It has been useful to debate human rights twice in a couple of days .
Thank you very much Commissioner Patten .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 6.00 p.m.
Danube environmental disaster
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0164 / 2000 by Mr Leinen on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists ,
B5-0179 / 2000 by Mrs Schroedter and others on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance
This disaster has raised a number of important issues which concern us as a European Union .
The polluter ought to pay .
I would be in favour of its doing so .
The delta of the Danube is in danger .
I hope that our future partners will demonstrate greater responsibility .
The environment must be a priority area within the reunification of the European continent .
It must form the basis for our partners ' political will .
The efforts already being made need to be stepped up .
If we do not , we will be permanently endangering the ecological wealth of our continent .
It is incomprehensible that an accident of this kind could have happened at all today .
The answer , of course , is an emphatic no .
There must be no more manufacture or use of cyanide .
It has already been banned in most EU countries for a long time now .
That an accident like this can happen at all is therefore an extremely shameful state of affairs .
We must demand that there should be no exceptions which could jeopardise people ' s health and the ecosystems .
We know full well that pollution and restoration costs run into billions .
Who is going to pay ?
An objective assessment of the facts is not easy at this stage .
It has destroyed an entire ecosystem in a matter of days .
No living organisms , from microbes to otters , have been spared .
Several Members have set out what seems to have happened .
We have all seen some of the consequences on our television screens .
It has affected the peoples of three countries - Romania , Hungary and Yugoslavia .
As with all such disasters it is the long-term consequences that are the most pernicious .
Some estimates suggest that it could take up to five years to restock the river .
There is a continuing threat to other wildlife from eating toxic fish .
We stand ready to do so .
It is to that end that our efforts are now engaged .
This is an important point , as several speakers have suggested .
The polluter-pays principle is a cornerstone of European Union environmental policy .
The European Union could not substitute itself for the mining company for any compensation payments due .
But for now the priority is to cope with this crisis .
As I have said , my colleague , Commissioner Wallström , is on the spot today .
The debate is closed .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
Tourism and employment
, rapporteur .
Those figures are incomparably higher for some countries .
Another factor is that the world market is growing explosively .
The forecast is for ten billion tourists in 2010 , but unfortunately for Europe there is a reverse trend .
First and foremost , we need to compete in terms of quality .
Mr President , there are three points I wish to address .
The first is the inclusion of a legal base in the Treaty .
This is something I favour , but currently as part of a minority in my own Group .
At the same time the Commission is currently concerned about confining itself to core tasks .
Third , there are several references in the resolution to permanent employment .
But there will always be people who are looking for seasonal employment .
Students are an obvious example .
But it is also a very vulnerable sector , as we recently saw with the oil slick .
This could be developed and provide a large number of new jobs .
But these regions need to take real account of positive and negative experiences in other tourist sectors .
We must not kill the goose that lays the golden egg of tourism .
I can think of many mountain regions which are continually spoilt in order to develop a tourist sector .
Having heard many Members who share the view expressed in the opinion , this was a real relief .
Unfortunately , his text has not survived the vote .
This brings me to the content of the report .
An important aspect of the tourism industry is employment and potential employment .
Especially in the southern Member States , the tourist industry is a major source of income .
The discrepancies between the different regions can often be traced back to cultural or historical factors .
Within these regions , a huge range of problems have their part to play .
For this reason , I cannot therefore endorse the transfer of powers to European level .
In addition , employment policy in general is also a factor .
It is preferable for Member States to take measures to stimulate employment themselves .
Their expertise , is , of course , superior to that of the Commission .
This is why I am very hesitant when it comes to formulating Community measures to promote employment .
Even in the tourism industry .
Mr President , you will understand that we cannot assent to the present resolution as it stands .
It is a very extensive report .
I hope that the Commission will not forget that .
We need a more dynamic vision based on tourism ' s contribution to job creation .
I know the Commissioner is very keen on information technology .
He has convinced me of that .
But his portfolio of information technology and tourism actually go very well together .
Let us look at some of these reasons .
The importance to the economy of tourism and its growth potential is obviously one .
We are losing market share .
I believe we have to do something to make ourselves more competitive .
I hope you will help us .
The lack of any legal base makes it impossible to adopt measures relating to the sector .
But we must support our tourism !
Clearly it is impossible to adopt measures at the national level .
Since then , however , there has been no progress .
I would take this opportunity to ask him a couple of questions directly .
Tourism is an activity that falls decidedly and fundamentally within the competence of the European Union .
It regards tourism for senior citizens .
Employment issues are at present the core concern regarding tourism .
This will determine the success of our work .
Certainly the Commission will seek good coordination with national employment policies .
Regarding sustainability indicators , the European Environment Agency is already working with the Commission on the issue .
These possibilities should be fully exploited .
Mr Provan said that I often talk a lot about tourism and information technology .
This will dramatically change the way it operates .
Commission decisions have advanced the methodological approach .
In the autumn the Commission will report back on the progress made in this respect .
Mr Medina Ortega asked me some very concrete questions .
At the moment , the question of congestion of air and roads is the fundamental problem .
We need to have this streamlined approach on tourism which covers all the policies .
Why is it so important in that sector ?
That is where the potential is .
There is one problem that I hesitate to mention today as I am new in the sector .
Then we could have a solid dialogue in our everyday work .
That is the real difficulty which we must overcome .
We will see what happens but at the moment that seems to be the case .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
( The sitting was closed at 7.40 p.m. )
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Thank you , Mr Nogueira , for your explanation .
I would remind you that questions on the Minutes should refer to the Minutes .
The Spanish Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament were represented .
Strasbourg , 17 February " .
I therefore believe that the issue is totally cleared up .
We take note and this will appear in the Minutes .
We should consider on principle whether there is any point at all in holding these kinds of meetings .
We can just as easily find out what happened from the newspapers .
So I think we should consider simply abolishing these meetings once and for all .
Surely we should be more selective .
In any event , the Bureau will consider your suggestion .
( The Minutes were approved )
We think its inclusion there would be both more appropriate and more effective .
One such area is tourism which , by its very nature , is very much a national concern .
Even in that respect , any cooperation should , however , be carried out according to the subsidiarity principle .
However , such a strategy should come within the framework of environmental policy .
I am therefore voting against the proposal .
European postal services
They can also be consulted on the Commission 's Internet website .
I am sure Commissioner Bolkestein will listen carefully to all Parliament 's comments .
Furthermore , the submission of a proposal is a legal obligation .
One of the EU ' s most important tenets is the need for a common internal market .
We are currently working hard to enlarge this to include ever more Member States .
That requires greater efficiency which , in turn , is dependent on competition .
It can hardly be because customers are satisfied .
A number of countries have been in the forefront of introducing more competitive postal services .
The Netherlands , Finland and Sweden have travelled furthest along this road .
During the 1990s , they were able to show the benefits that could be achieved .
Moreover , Sweden has introduced the changes gradually in a climate of political consensus .
The process should be allowed to continue and be given the necessary encouragement .
That shows that competition really is working .
It is against just such a background that more and more people are calling for ...
( The speaker is interrupted by Mr Markov ) I thought I had the floor .
Perhaps we can discuss this later on .
That is usually the case .
Mr Markov , in five or six minutes time , you will be allowed a few minutes to speak .
I would be grateful if you would not interrupt other Members .
Mr President , there is a mystery .
What happened to the Postal Services Directive that was passed on 15 December 1997 ?
There has been a deafening silence from the Commission during the period between then and now .
I am sorry it is Commissioner Monti who is here today .
I am very fond of him .
He is one of the more diligent and hard working commissioners .
It is a pity I cannot say the same for some of his other colleagues .
There has , over this period , been no real progress on the Postal Services Directive .
That has only happened recently .
For over a year the old Commission could have done some work on this .
We really have not progressed very far .
These issues were fundamental in that report and they should be fundamental in any forthcoming directive .
The postal service is not just for Christmas .
It is for life .
In the area in Scotland I come from it is much more than just a postal service .
It is about keeping communities together .
The postal service is also the bus service .
The postal service is also the social service .
The postal service is also the doctor .
We will cut them off .
The postal services are important .
That message must be taken back from here today .
The Commission must listen to it .
Mr President , we are in favour of liberalising the Union ' s postal services .
This should first of all stand for better service .
This is the intention and it must be the ultimate goal .
As far as I know , that has still not happened .
I would welcome more concrete information on this .
Apparently , the postal service is a very strong lobby and rightly so .
There are hundreds of thousands of people who earn their living at the Post Office .
The postal service is also extremely important to companies .
What exactly do you intend to liberalise ?
We need to protect this type of arrangement and denounce other things .
This concerns us deeply and that is why we requested this debate today .
That is not the sort of postal service that we want .
I have nothing against liberalisation and privatisation , but the premises must be right .
Examples in Germany and Sweden show that this certainly is a risk .
Well , for the time being , the revision has not got off the starting block .
My first question is this : surely the scheduled time limits were too short in any case ?
Apparently , they were .
Should we complain about this delay ?
We do not think so .
What are the scenarios for development and the potential risks ?
But other countries , in other situations , may have alternative analyses .
In our opinion , each one must be free to make its own organisational choices .
But who defines these tasks ?
Who established the limit beyond which this public service mission is compromised ?
To wish to proceed in any other way would be to distort the spirit of our institutions .
What has become of it ?
Do we have the results of this impact study ?
This is already an intolerable withdrawal of the public service .
Once again , Europe is distancing itself from its poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants .
Everyone is free to choose their lifestyle .
They should be able to do so without compromising their equal opportunities and equal treatment .
In sport the saying goes , " Do not change a winning team . "
Why should we wish to change a system which is satisfactory ?
We are told we should change the limit from 350 grammes to 150 grammes , or even 50 grammes .
But this directive has never been transposed into national law .
A small segment of our market has been taken over by private operators .
I come from a rural area .
We allowed it and the result is that our young people can travel and broaden their education .
I want the Commission to recognise that this is a necessary social service .
It should go hand in hand with our postal services in rural areas .
We must implement what the directive insists on , that the postal service is available to everybody .
How are we to deal with the transfer of the national post office ' s business abroad ?
We have just heard Mr McCartin on the subject .
But what will those limits be ?
But then again , the central theme of the liberalisation of the postal services is employment .
Liberalisation is not the only potential threat to post office services .
Such recognisable and useful core tasks give the electorate a reason to vote .
They are much less interested in a government which takes no interest in these affairs .
The end result will be that existing companies will also be forced into bad practices .
They will get their workforce to do more work at lower wages .
It is time we stopped this trend .
A fault confessed is half redressed .
I also see this as offering special potential for the existing postal service .
The collection , sorting , transportation and delivery of mail will take on an entirely new dimension .
I believe that in future we must seize this opportunity .
As politicians we must devote special attention to defending consumer interests .
We want our consumers to obtain as much as possible for the wages they are paid .
They also play a major role in maintaining links between people .
I do not believe that it is anybody ' s intention to do so .
But they might accidentally do great damage .
The critical thing is to balance universality and affordability .
On the contrary , it should proceed cautiously .
I imagine anything less than 150 grammes would be extremely unwise in these circumstances .
Stand by universality and affordability !
This service must therefore be kept public .
I think ours is a different approach !
I think the consumer can decide for himself and define in advance what he needs .
I believe we should give the postal service a chance to adapt to new trends .
I believe a liberalised market will speed up this process more than a less liberalised market .
It also offers some prospect of conveying a positive picture of European policy .
We should seize that opportunity , for the citizen keeps asking , why do we have Europe ?
These are areas where the citizen can see and understand the benefit of Europe .
So I would ask you to give an impetus in that direction , together with Parliament .
I emphasise the word ' could ' , and that is if it is done well and with care .
Wrongly done , the threatening images that have been described here will certainly become a reality .
Postal services may then keep whatever does not whet the appetite of the private operators .
Whether total or partial , privatisation will only make an already dismal situation worse .
One example of this slow progress is the way the Commission is proceeding .
This brings me to my second point , namely the snail as symbol of our postal services .
Letters to Strasbourg arrive there a bit sooner , but it still takes far too long .
But what we have often seen in recent years was the very opposite !
They have referred to rural and sparsely populated areas .
I come from Munich , a very densely populated urban conglomeration , but we have the same problem there .
One urban district post office after another is being closed down .
This has consequences for free competition between the different postal administrations .
We do not know what will happen in each of the countries where liberalisation is going to take place .
In the world of networking , the mail service is the most democratic of all networks .
It creates and maintains interpersonal relationships .
The common market in postal services will be created on the terms of the marketeers .
For us in the north it will mean that the EU will be destroying the social infrastructure .
The post office is democracy .
It is better suited to handling such matters than telecommunications companies .
Democratic investments have to be made to preserve a democratic post office .
I would suggest that there is a solution .
It is already employed widely in the transport sector .
Let us call this a negative tender franchise .
The lowest subsidy would win the franchise for a certain period of time .
Otherwise the postal services can be left to all the demands and constraints of the marketplace .
That is a measure of the importance to us of our postal services .
Scotland as a country is larger than some Member States .
It is on the last two that the elderly , in particular , depend .
Often they are located together , each service being made more viable by the existence of the other .
And it is about four times the postage cost actually charged .
The more remote the community , the greater the difference becomes .
That is the measure of the problem .
Some Members , like Mr Stenmarck , complain that there have been delays with the new proposal .
This is , for example , the position expressed by Mr Berthu .
But we feel that there is a legal obligation for a proposal to be made .
The scheduled date of 1 January 2003 for implementation of the next steps remains feasible .
A number of problems exist as regards the structure of the regulator and its independence .
The implementation deadline for the Member States is January 2003 .
Further liberalisation will occur afterwards .
The quality of services has , generally speaking , improved , in particular in regard to cross-border activity .
So this is not a selling-out of the service and of its quality .
The studies have been the object of some criticism , especially on the part of the public postal services .
I am aware that all the studies launched experienced difficulty in collecting adequate data .
Does that not say a lot about management ability ?
This applies both to the post and other sectors .
We have just received the reply of the German Government to the observations made .
In a sense this is where its work begins .
Most companies hate competition .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
( Parliament adopted the resolution ) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Postal services must continue to be public services .
Such jobs are unquestionably useful , and creating an adequate number of them would reduce unemployment in Europe .
Postal services do not provide simply a postal delivery service but also a social service .
Occasionally for some people the postman is the only person they see all day .
Profitability at all costs means going against fraternity and against social cohesion .
Mr President , I voted for the resolution and should like to explain my motives .
I wholeheartedly agree .
That should amply compensate them for forgoing their contact with the postman .
I know that this service is unprofitable .
( FR ) Here indeed is a sector which has highlighted the limitations and serious deficiencies of liberalisation .
I am a European and even a federalist .
Parliament has completed the agenda .
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
( The sitting was closed at 11.10 a.m. )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday , 18 February 2000 .
Statement by the President
These men paid with their lives for their commitment to democracy .
I utterly condemn this act of barbarism that is unworthy of any civilised society .
Terrorism , whatever form it takes , is unacceptable .
( The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence )
The following is a translated extract from his autobiography . ' We are in Europe .
In my grandparents ' time , it took several days to travel from Vitoria to Seville .
This process may take a long time but it is unstoppable and , what is more , desirable .
What difference does it make if the national level is no longer going to function ? "
What difference does it make to be Basque ? Surely it is all the same thing .
May he rest in peace .
( Loud applause )
( Loud applause )
This , Madam President , is the only way forward which we therefore fully support .
Why does Parliament not meet in all the countries of the European Union and show that it rejects terrorism ?
Let us make ourselves heard !
We are not just confined to Brussels or Strasbourg .
We , Euskal Herritarrok , have regretted many times the loss of human lives .
We share with all the Basque citizens the sufferings of our people .
May I ask : Quousque tandem - Noiz arte ?
Thank you , Mrs Dührkop Dührkop , I should like to assure you of my empathy and sincere respect .
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
You promised Parliament you would raise this subject with the Quaestors that very evening .
But we shall have a decision very soon .
( The Minutes were adopted )
Reforming the Commission
The next item is the Commission statement on Reforming the European Commission .
I shall give the floor straight away to the President , Mr Romano Prodi .
Briefly , these are the main points of the reform .
The second point is human resources .
All this has to change , and this is one of the main reasons for our reform .
These are the areas in which changes will be made .
We are going to create a management and control system in every Directorate-General .
We want to be a model of a completely computerised administration .
This is not just a technical revolution , but a complete organisational revolution as well .
The very political essence of the reform is mirrored in the objectives of this five-year plan .
This is why we are redefining all our work priorities .
Parliament and the Council are also called upon to take up all the challenges presented by these reforms .
The White Paper puts reform in its proper political context .
Reform and renewal are essential for that purpose too .
But the Commission does exist to serve the Union and its peoples with high standards of performance .
The House will be aware , of course , that the Commission cannot fulfil these objectives alone .
Inevitably , that will mean identifying activities that could and should be reduced or ended .
Attempts to micro-manage the Commission ' s operations are clearly in no one ' s interest .
Again , that will be a very demanding challenge .
Thank you , Commissioner Kinnock .
We shall now move on to Question Time .
Madam President , the Commission proposals include the waiver of immunity of officials .
There is effective legal precaution .
Now there were two points I wanted to pick up with Mr Kinnock , if I may .
The first one concerns the timescale of these important reforms .
Big expectations are built up for these reforms both within the Commission and outside .
I suggest that is too long , and we really must move forward much more quickly than that .
The second point that I want to make concerns information technology .
I would like to make one last point in answer to Mr Harbour .
I do not use those as an excuse .
I would like everything to happen much more quickly .
It is better to do it absolutely properly .
Mr Prodi has pointed out that he would like to give up a few of his responsibilities .
We will therefore need to focus on policy priorities first .
Enlargement - that is enlargement of the Union - is one of the key challenges in this context .
Two questions if I may .
We anticipate , if I understand correctly , a report in September on core activities .
Let the managers manage .
So far as the September communication is concerned , it is unprecedented .
We are also interested in value for the people who work for us .
The changes in financial management and control will greatly enhance the possibility of doing all of that .
There is a degree of independence obviously allocated to the current Financial Controller by the financial regulation .
There are absolute assurances of that and provisions made for it in the White Paper .
Irresponsibility because the feeling exists in some quarters that there will not be sufficient control and discipline .
Indeed the Court of Auditors has called it fiction .
That is the level of sophistication and provision I would like to see .
Can I start by wishing the Commissioner a very happy St David ' s Day .
Thank you for the presentation .
That really has to be the sharp focus the whole time .
That is a clear complaint that we get .
That needs to be addressed .
The other question I would like to ask is on the audit progress committee .
Will you be adding that into your audit progress committee ' s work ?
As far as excessive paper is concerned , the dilemma is spelt out by Mrs Morgan .
I know I can rely on everyone here .
That concludes Question Time .
I should like to thank President Prodi and Commissioner Kinnock .
Statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy
The next item is the statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy .
Please give a very warm welcome to Mr Javier Solana to whom I shall hand over without further delay .
Sometimes we may feel that too much has happened .
These were essentially of three types which I will describe .
I will restrict myself to these three points in order to bring you up to date with events .
You can be satisfied with the progress made .
This Military Committee , as you can imagine , will have various duties .
In less than two months we have established the mechanics for cooperation with the Commission .
I will set this out in five points .
How can we do this ?
I have two further points to make on this process .
We are working in this direction with the Commission and Commissioner Patten .
In this respect we are also working closely and positively with the Commission .
I am not going to say much more on these issues .
The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is poor and deteriorating .
These are the only positive aspects which I can tell you about at the moment .
Madam President , this brings me to the end of my speech .
I would just like to repeat what I said at the beginning .
Thank you , Mr Poettering .
Commissioner , would you like to speak now or a little later ?
( The Commissioner indicated that he would speak later ) Very well , thank you .
We are delighted about the rapid progress which has been made following the Helsinki Summit .
We know that you have an important role in this .
We cannot , of course , talk about foreign policy without mentioning Chechnya .
My friend Jacques Poos will be talking about this on behalf of my Group .
I want to concentrate on Kosovo .
They have now been replaced by robust Danish , Finnish and Swedish troops .
Through the Stability Pact , we have taken major steps which place us under an obligation .
At the moment , there is a huge shortage of suitable personnel in Kosovo .
Last autumn , we already heard Mr Bernard Kouchner call for a civilian police force .
Therefore , the EU must also have an independent , credible conflict-prevention capacity .
On behalf of the Commission , Commissioner Patten has taken a number of praiseworthy initiatives in this direction .
I am thinking partly of the forthcoming and important humanitarian , peace-keeping and peace-making tasks .
When we are divided , we are weakened , and the suffering of the oppressed is prolonged .
You also share a heavy degree of responsibility for ensuring that we do not end up as paper tigers .
It may have been our weakness and lack of credibility which led to the war .
Diplomatic pressure is only successful when it is backed up by credible economic and military threats .
Everything else is wishful thinking .
The third heavy burden on your shoulders is the responsibility for ensuring parliamentary scrutiny .
This should be exercised first and foremost in the Member States .
No soldier can , of course , be despatched without the approval of the relevant national parliament .
It is therefore wrong for people to talk about a European army .
It will be a force comprised of various national units .
Yesterday , a few of us met the Portuguese Defence Minister .
Bear in mind that there are also non-aligned countries at the negotiating table .
Mr President , Mr Solana , we are all behaving like children .
It is extraordinary what decisions we took in Sintra concerning 2004 , 2005 , 2006 .
But what about Kosovo in the year 2000 ?
He tells the story of a Serbian doctor who has just been murdered in Pristina .
He treated Roma , Albanians and Serbs and that is something unforgivable in Kosovo .
A man with three children and he was murdered .
We need policemen in Kosovo right now !
We need soldiers who do not have a doctrine to put into practice .
Tell me , what civilian forces are being mobilised , Mr Patten ?
Mr Poettering is right - when he is right you have to tell him so .
He is not always right , but in this case he is .
We are accomplices in the massacres in Chechnya if we continue to give money to the butchers .
It is not enough just to say , " You , the murderers , please stop the slaughter ! "
They know full well that they should not commit these acts .
But that is his strategy , he instigated this war .
From the beginning , he wanted this war in order to become president .
So that is the world as it is today .
I believe that European defence should be scrutinised by the European Parliament and by the national parliaments .
But to believe that this muddle can be autonomous is another matter altogether .
Let us just consider for a moment .
What is the basis of armed action ?
In short , what purpose can an armed force have in the absence of any policy ?
A foreign policy presupposes that one has a clear definition of oneself and of one ' s own interests .
It is still the old imperial service .
Do you think I am going over the top ?
Every day the news brings more proof of our subservience .
The experts speak of a cultural problem , I think they might be right !
I can already hear your reply : humanitarian standards .
' Restore hope ' , do you remember ?
Finally , you spoke about using the great resources of crisis management .
Not to make war , of course , but to protect peace .
But these are always the words that those who conduct preventative wars use to justify their actions .
Mr Solana , these questions convey our concern .
You say that you are against war , but you would not be the first warmonger to swear that .
May God spare us the disastrous consequences of the bombastic principles that you have just put forward .
Given Poland ' s rather critical stance , this question is all the more pressing .
If anything , the European defence identity should serve to strengthen NATO " .
We all very much share this opinion .
These opinions add substance to my question addressed to Mr Solana .
Poles only need five words for this : nothing about us without us !
For my part , I do not wish to give up hope .
What are the main priorities that you hope to achieve at the next summit meetings ?
And finally , what do you most need at these next summits ?
My second question is different , although it is not unconnected with the previous one .
It concerns the next IGC .
Can you tell us your position on this subject ?
Mr President , Bosnia and Kosovo have shaken Europe .
The decision to set up our own peace force is excellent .
Mr Solana can play an important role in this .
He is not stupid . Certainly not !
He is a driven man , a competent man .
But the question remains as to whether this accumulation of responsibilities exceeds even his level of competence .
One wonders whether he gets any time to sleep , Mr President .
This too is unacceptable in my view .
Mr Solana must keep Europe awake without nodding off himself .
Some of them are our ACP partners .
The war is an extension of degenerated underdevelopment .
In Kosovo , we stepped in with military means , having been unable to prevent the war in ex-Yugoslavia .
We are now unable to guide the peace .
This is why Europe is not credible as a Union .
I do not believe , Mr Solana , that we can restore this credibility by military means .
At the moment , Europe does not have a foreign policy to speak of .
I can hardly believe that we will ever achieve this at intergovernmental level .
Because our borders do not stop at the Mediterranean Sea .
Mr President , allow me to start with the conquest of Kosovo .
We have taken fifteen years to achieve Economic and Monetary Union .
We know the strength that they have acquired over these forty years of building the Community .
But I do wonder what his own view is on this .
According to the documents , cooperation with the High Representative was fruitful .
We would then have a voice in NATO through this European pillar .
Actually , I hear less and less about this .
It seems evident that they would do this in joint cooperation , which would work very well .
But is there not more to it than that ?
Is this actually how we want things done ?
Will it be omitted ?
At the same time , an appeal has also been made in broad terms to increase the defence budgets .
I wonder how this will develop .
I would like to ask both gentlemen how they view the long-term future .
I am pleased that this has opened a few matters up in relation to defence policy .
The fabric of Turkey ' s government contains a few Haider-type personalities .
That would seem odd to me .
Secondly , the Baltic States are also knocking on our door .
Will they also take part in our defence policy ?
It is a very interesting position to be in , to say the least .
A word of warning to the latter : this policy needs substantial democratic legitimisation .
Mr Solana , I am sitting quite close to you , close enough to see your face .
I think that you have aged , your face is quite lined .
You are Spanish ; you are from a large country , Mr Solana .
Spain and Franco were not one and the same .
You know the French proverb , ' Nothing for nothing ' .
I will give you an example .
Mr Solana , it has been said many times in this House that prevention is better than cure .
In any case , it is prevention that I would like to discuss today .
War is threatening to break out again in the Gulf .
Today , we have the chance to prevent it ; tomorrow it may be too late .
This has not just happened .
The level of practical assistance from the Community and from the Member States has been pathetic .
These are of long standing , but are being addressed already within NATO .
NATO is largely European .
What about the infrastructures ?
Is there some sort of provision which will allow the system as a whole to have this administrative autonomy ?
Will current programmes continue to be implemented ?
Has any thought been given to the matter ?
Has it been discussed ?
I hope this is not an omen for this Sintra Agreement .
We have all heard some of the tales emanating from the Council of Ministers building in Brussels .
And indeed , some Member States are not geared for mobility .
They are very static in their military forces , and unsuitable for this sort of warfare .
We cannot leave it simply to governments .
I strongly support the decisions taken at Sintra .
I am anxious to know how effective the EU ' s policy planning and early warning unit has been .
What we need are 60 000 civilian policemen and women in order to try and deal with these situations .
We have large gaps in what we are arguing for , in principle , in relation to human rights .
What are we going to do seriously to bring that appalling situation to an end ?
Meetings are all very well , but it is the result that counts .
I would just like to say a word or two myself on that particular subject .
So again , rhetoric and reality .
But perhaps I could just say one or two things this afternoon .
All those things come together .
We will be producing a communication on anti-personnel landmines , actually the use of sensor equipment .
The work that has been done in dealing with landmines has been a success story in Mozambique .
We are again going to have to go through the same sort of exercise .
So the point I want to make is that all these things are intimately related .
I have heard promises that we will establish a stability pact in the southern Caucuses .
Where is the beef ?
And that is not a contribution to any recent political controversy .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Patten .
Women in the decision-making process
Two centuries later , we have achieved a great deal in Europe .
The last century was marked by three periods .
This was followed by a second period , in which the worth of female models was recognised .
There were women everywhere .
For the first time in Finland , the women candidates outnumbered the men .
And a woman was elected .
A great deal has been said and numerous policies have been implemented in the Member States .
But the figures tell the true story .
And the figures still give Europe cause for concern .
The number of women on committees who wield power and frame policies is very small .
What we need , therefore , is to promote specific policies .
We need organisation and statistical monitoring .
And , of course , these policies need a budget , they need to be given financial teeth .
Nor must we underestimate the representation of women in economic decision-making centres .
I should like to be absolutely categorical .
( Applause )
Women make up half the population , half the strength of the planet .
I am optimistic that we shall succeed .
The bet before us is a bet with time .
Future generations of women must not be sidelined .
If need be , we must use all possible means to force the situation .
( Applause )
Some Members have even come out against this .
This is a feeling which men will never have and it is an important difference .
It could hardly have been made more abundantly clear , what we are concerned with here .
I am convinced that it will be hard work , when all is said and done .
That is absolutely crucial .
Just for the record , I would say that she might well also have mentioned Denmark .
And I say that , of course , because I come from Denmark .
I should like to broach some of the points the Commissioner mentioned , notably the question of financial resources .
The issue is therefore one of appropriate structures .
The first is the issue of the media ' s influence .
I think it is very important that we should investigate what kind of stereotypes the media establish .
Do we have a special problem in this regard ?
I have to say that I do not know the precise answer to that question .
I have a suspicion that this is the case , but I am not certain .
The second point is the enlargement of the Union .
It is systematic monitoring which will reveal this .
Mainstreaming is a long-term commitment and process .
In 1910 , a woman ' s right to vote was on the agenda .
Women are no homogenous collective .
Women belong to different social classes .
Women have different individual needs and interests .
When the talk turns to quota allocation by gender , the word " qualifications " also crops up .
What is interesting is that the qualifications demanded are rarely defined .
Being a man therefore seems , in itself , to be synonymous with maximum competence .
We do not have any such officers , but black grandmothers are in fact to be found .
Undoubtedly there are too few women involved in politics .
It is not absolutely certain that the predominance of men in the party machinery alone is responsible .
In France , 95 % of elected representatives are town councillors .
The vast majority of them are not members of any party .
In order to be elected as a local councillor , you just have to want to be elected .
But access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local mandates .
Our Group wants to encourage the fair representation of men and women in the institutions of the European Union .
With such a philosophy it would no longer be necessary to organise elections or administrative competitions .
It would be sufficient to determine the composition of the ministries and assemblies by means of a statistical calculation .
On the other hand , such a policy shows a deep contempt for women .
Women deserve more than a quota .
Therefore , Commissioner , you can go ahead .
You do not need to wait for a new amendment to the Treaty .
Here again , Commissioner , the ball is in your court .
Do not take too long to send it back .
The presence of women in decision-making bodies , in particular , is a question of democracy .
Women work an average of 60 hours a week , which is 20 hours longer than men .
Mr President , before I came here for today ' s sitting , I was watching Finnish television .
It is quite logical , it is consistent !
So , there should be no positive discrimination to include women .
Woman are capable of getting themselves included because they are pragmatic and full of common sense .
That simply amounts to acknowledging their inferiority .
But when it comes to important decisions and priorities , there is a lack of women ' s voices .
That is unacceptable in a democracy .
I am therefore delighted that the Commissioner is well disposed towards a system of this kind .
We have high hopes for what you will achieve .
The Lisbon Summit to be held at the end of this month is very much geared towards women .
I think this is a very sad state of affairs .
This is why we need to be sensible about applying quotas .
But we should draw the necessary conclusions from this .
Mr President , why do women need their rightful share in political decision making ?
And how should we achieve this ?
We all agree on the fact that it needs to be done and why it is necessary .
But if we look into how to achieve this , the opinions are greatly divided .
Like Mrs Van Lancker , I am a product of such a measure .
We would , in this way , violate democracy .
The problem which we have to deal with is how to change the composition of the decision-making centres .
The debate is a deeply political one .
There are two approaches .
The first is a policy of persuasion .
Gradually everyone will be persuaded that women can become involved .
How do we respond therefore to the fact that women are excluded ?
We are able but the rest of the female population is not ?
Here lies the danger of female arrogance in politics . Because women have to deal with different realities .
Because they have fewer opportunities .
Because they have a different level of education .
The second comment is that we need to persuade the political leaders .
They have all been persuaded !
There is not one male politician who does not agree to the involvement of women .
On paper !
Thirdly , we must expect things to change gradually .
The women ' s conference in Beijing brought an important point to light .
The second approach is a compulsory legislative commitment on the representation of women .
Quotas alone are not enough .
If only a legislative decree were all it took to change centuries of history .
On this we are clear .
Quotas are one of the ways , one of the policies needed to bring about change .
Thank you , Mrs Diamantopoulou .
I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow morning .
Floods in Mozambique
The next item is the Commission statement on flooding in Mozambique .
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
Several people have lost their lives , many have disappeared , many have been injured .
The government of Mozambique has appealed for humanitarian aid from third countries .
Mr Nielson will be happy to report back to Parliament on the findings of his mission .
If ever a country deserved help from aid donors it was Mozambique .
Let me turn to the assistance provided so far .
A third decision will be considered in the light of the mission of Commissioner Nielson .
There have already been hundreds of deaths .
We must be aware of the aftermath of the floods .
They urgently need aid such as food , water and shelter in order to survive .
Helicopters are therefore needed .
Apparently there are only five at the moment to rescue about 80 000 people from trees .
The machinery mobilising the aid is too slow .
I must remind you in particular of the efforts of Mr Rocard during the previous term .
However , Africa is surprisingly not included in the DIPECHO plans .
The DIPECHO agenda includes south-east Asia , Central America and the Caribbean .
The PSE Group has always supported the Commission ' s humanitarian aid policy .
The time has also come to demand greater efficiency .
Mr President , the situation in Mozambique is of the greatest urgency .
Each day , each hour of delay costs many lives .
Starvation and epidemics seem inevitable .
It is as if the whole world is looking on , helplessly .
The question is whether the Commission has reacted with sufficient alertness .
I must admit that I have my doubts about this .
Unlike a number of Member States , the European Union has promised only very limited aid so far .
What options does the Commission have , to offer effective help fast ?
What could emergency and reconstruction aid consist of ?
Can Commissioner Patten update us on the international coordination so far ?
This would be a real tragedy and one which would weigh heavily on the conscience of us all .
This morning there were seven helicopters and of course those helicopters are only working in the Gaza region .
The Save river has huge flooding problems as well but no one has even been there yet .
Most of us here would not wish to boast about EUR 3 million .
Clearly also we need to see a massive airlift .
Are we ready to pay for those resources ?
Thank you , Mrs Kinnock .
The debate is closed .
Union Economy ( 1999 )
This is the challenge .
It has been my proposal that Parliament must recommend an activist economic policy consisting of two main parts .
This was the first pillar of my recommendation .
The report which has come to you from the Economic Committee sins in all these respects .
Moreover , several countries were mentioned whose problem is what to do with the public surplus .
We therefore still have too much bureaucracy and intervention .
What are the minimum conditions under which we would vote for this report ?
It will be voting against it .
This unification is considered to be positive by the Commission ' s report .
Even if he advocates sustainable growth , sustainability does not come into it .
The use of energy and scarce raw materials should be drastically reduced
Other priorities are the repayment of high public debt and restructuring pension schemes .
An appeal in favour of a more pro-active government policy comes across as very odd .
Promoting employment , however , is a long-winded affair and comes under structural policy .
Member States , in particular , should adopt an effective policy .
In order to achieve this , they must be given the necessary leeway .
What did Mr Katiforis actually propose and what has been taken out of the report ?
And Europe has indeed achieved progress by means of quantified targets .
We therefore need to augment our rate of employment with jobs that are competitive .
We also need investment to grow at a faster rate .
Investment levels are too low , unemployment is still too high and there is insufficient growth .
My conclusions about this differ completely , however , from those of the previous speaker .
Instead , you have to mobilise working people and the people out there in the Member States .
This is the key ideological struggle for Europe facing us .
This debate , I think , has summed it up .
This report is a wake-up call to Europe .
This report recommends radical measures , which in essence will make it easier to employ people .
It is as simple as that .
It cannot create jobs just by government spending .
The real world simply does not work like that .
Mr President , Mr Katiforis ' s report is exciting .
The debate and vote here in plenary ought to correct this .
We have that opportunity right now . Let us grasp it .
The Portuguese presidency has submitted a wide agenda of this kind for the extra summit in Lisbon .
The Commission has done this in its five-year plan by listing one of the four priorities .
However , I believe that there are also some elements of consensus .
Employment is growing at a good rate .
When we submitted our report , we referred to the risks posed by growth .
Anyway , we currently have some excellent opportunities to do more .
We need public and private investment .
What policy should we use to achieve these objectives ?
The policy mix to be applied should specifically allow this capacity to be fully absorbed .
We must define a macro-economic policy which aids growth .
This is not an expansionist policy in the sense of growth for growth ' s sake .
This policy mix will undoubtedly be good for investment and will lead to growth .
Firstly , private investment must be assisted .
Our main support in the future must be for research and development and human capital .
These are two of the principal challenges for the Lisbon Summit .
This is the policy which the Commission has defended and will continue to defend in Lisbon .
Common fisheries policy
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
I understand that they have been some five years in their gestation .
Both biological and economic information are included .
The proposal also makes provision for Member States to produce such data in aggregated form .
The implementing regulation will establish a minimum Community programme and an extended Community programme .
It also allows the Commission itself to finance studies and pilot projects .
The first relates to the degree of involvement of the Commission .
The original proposal simply allowed for the information being gathered to be transmitted to international organisations .
The Commission would only receive a copy of any such transmissions if it requested one .
This change is taken in conjunction with Amendments Nos 1 , 4 and 7 .
Amendment No 4 makes it clear that the object of the exercise is the evaluation of fisheries resources generally .
The other area of concern related to the range of data to be collected under the regulation .
First , in respect to economic data , Amendment No 2 makes two changes .
It merely permits the Commission to do so should it so wish .
As already stated the proposal for the Council decision falls into two parts .
The first is concerned with financing the Member States in implementing the Community programmes .
The second is to allow the Commission itself to finance pilot studies and projects .
Amendments Nos 4 and 5 aim to ensure that financial information is forwarded continuously to the budgetary authority .
This provides a safeguard to ensure that the necessary resources will continue to be available .
My Group has included two reasonable requests .
I wish at the outset to congratulate Mrs Attwooll on the preparation and presentation of her report .
I agree with the proposals that information provided to international organisations should also be made available to the Commission .
Sound , factual information is in the best interests of the industry .
We are trying to manage a policy of catches and in so doing we are creating injustice .
That is scandalous , their case ought to be heard .
It should be put on record , and I want to put it on record today .
It should be pointed out that not all the Member States have the same amount of data .
These deadlines for submission must therefore be staggered accordingly .
We must therefore act very carefully in this area and guarantee the confidentiality of this data .
In the past somebody said to me I have been defending the decisions the Commission makes .
We are also of the opinion that Community funds should be set aside to fund these activities .
A case in point is the Mediterranean , including my country ' s fishing industry .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Fischler .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Combating certain fish diseases
It sustains some 6 500 jobs and generates around EUR 800 million annually .
I therefore support the Commission ' s proposed changes and I am calling for their urgent adoption and implementation .
Most of their content is either unnecessary or already referred to in my text .
In Scotland we have endured a draconian regime which has failed to achieve its objective .
So I thoroughly recommend and hope that the Parliament will support this excellent report .
I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Hudghton , also for this report .
The example of Norway demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach .
This is not though to deny the importance of environmental considerations in relation to fish farming .
I think it is a very serious matter that we act in this way .
What about women ?
Nobody has undertaken any studies on human tissue in that regard .
And people have spoken in the past about BSE .
For many years the Greens were calling for the BSE issue to be addressed .
So it also has to do with environmental protection .
The protection of the farmers themselves and the protection of public health .
However , this cannot be allowed to compromise our objective of reducing and possibility eliminating ISA .
Nor can it be done , if the proposal involves a threat to public health .
The environmental implications must also be taken very seriously .
I am advised that ISA is considered non-pathogenic for humans and mammals .
The virus harms cold-blooded animals .
In no way , however , can diseased fish be used for human consumption .
As an extra precaution , I am validating this advice to our scientific committee .
I deeply regret the losses suffered by the Scottish salmon industry .
I must emphasise , however , that there are serious constraints .
Budgetary resources are very limited and priorities with other diseases have to be set .
So further thought is necessary .
This is in particular the case for Amendments Nos 3 and 5 .
I am not able to comment on the availability of commercial insurance .
The Commission included in its proposal a possibility for vaccination of salmon .
The intention of this proposal is to introduce a tool for combating the disease in emergency situations .
Those could perpetuate an infection .
I therefore am not able to accept Amendment No 4 .
You also referred to the need for further scientific research on the nature of the disease .
I also propose to provide that the withdrawal of fish displaying clinical signs of disease should be immediate .
I do not feel in a position to accept Amendments Nos 12 and 13 .
It is my feeling that these amendments aim to achieve a zero risk .
I can partly accept Amendment No 11 .
I believe that measures that are proportionate to that objective is the way forward .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Byrne .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Protection of juvenile marine organisms
The proposal before us as outlined in the introduction is a very important one .
The body then makes recommendations with a view to maintaining stocks .
The European Union is a contracting party and is obliged to embody such recommendations in Community law .
ICCAT also made recommendations in 1974 , 1994 and 1996 .
It is important to protect the tuna fishery for future generations .
80 percent of it was landed by purse seine .
All laudable stuff .
There can also be no doubt that bluefin tuna is of enormous environmental and financial significance .
I do not know what the metric equivalent is .
So I support the findings of ICCAT and I support the principle of intergovernmental cooperation on environmental issues .
My concern though with this debate is that we are fiddling whilst Rome burns .
The common fisheries policy is not working .
In mixed fisheries , you cannot discriminate .
From a UK perspective there is also a deep-seated political objection to the CFP .
Let me illustrate this with a topical example .
The scientists and the fishermen both agree that something has to be done .
Our rapporteur ' s criticisms on this point have also therefore been heeded .
I cannot and do not want to go any further as we are pushed for time .
However , I must again congratulate our rapporteur , Mr Gallagher .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Fischler .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Fishing and the environment ( Bergen 13-14 March 1997 ) : 2nd report
This is the basis of my request to the European Commission and the services of this House .
I am referring to this now because I will not have time to speak later on .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Fischler .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment
This is an unwise policy .
They should also be pursued in the context of the bilateral and multilateral agreements which the Community negotiates .
One can quote from the communication .
That appeared in the communication published last July .
What can be done to alleviate the damage done to fishing communities ?
Such pressures are greatest in Europe .
I recommend the report to the House .
One aspect that was missing from the communication though is the aspect of surveillance and control .
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report .
The relationship between fisheries and marine ecosystems is obvious .
To blame fishermen alone for environmental damage is both unfair and wrong .
As Mr Katiforis says , discards are a waste of resources which we cannot accept .
Twenty million tonnes of unwanted catches are being thrown back .
The fleet must therefore use increasingly selective fishing gear .
So we must practise selective fishing .
Aquaculture should also be monitored .
Let us therefore take great care with work in a closed environment .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would ask you to come and take part in this discussion .
I would like to touch briefly on these amendments .
And just as well , in my view .
Lastly , we would vote for the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left .
There is therefore a need for an in-depth analysis of the relationship between fishing and the environment .
This particularly applies , however , to our own coastal waters .
Given this context , I would like to tell you about something that happened a few days ago .
Can I first of all congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report .
Conservation is something that I hear on many occasions and a lot of people pay lip service to it .
A lot of people are all in favour of it until it arrives on their own doorstep .
It is all very well to talk about conservation and I agree with it totally .
It has been imposed upon them that they cannot fish for about an 11 to 12 week period .
That chasm exists and we in Brussels have not been able to cross that divide .
And we have got to take on board the views of the fishermen .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Fischler .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
If I may , however , just make a few comments on the method .
That is not the route that has been taken .
Today , in many Member States , that is not possible .
I consider that we are experiencing an historic moment in this regard .
I congratulate the rapporteur for having so quickly progressed further with his report .
The Commission considers that this regulation makes no substantive amendment to the text of the Convention .
On the other hand , it does not accept Amendment No 4 .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Vitorino .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
( The sitting was suspended at 12.05 a.m. )
Shipwreck of the Erika
Our President told us yesterday that the Commissioner would be unable to attend today due to prior commitments .
Enough regrets and thoughts have been expressed about this event .
We must now get down to adopting measures , Commissioner .
How can consumer confidence in products from this area be regained ?
How can those affected be compensated ?
We hope to hear specific proposals from the Commission , with plenty of action and no more regrets .
Prevention is better than cure or so the saying goes .
Mr Fischler says that he always comes to the House when asked .
Please let this be the last disaster of its type and let us learn all possible lessons from this .
The polluter pays principle is both necessary and appropriate .
I wish to put two questions to the Commissioner .
A great many proposals have been made which warrant investigation .
Solutions cannot be found at the last minute , when the disaster is already in progress .
Consequently , the bulk of the action must be taken beforehand .
The French State has released funds for compensating damage .
Cakes of tar are still washing in along 500 km of the Atlantic coastline on a daily basis .
Curiously , the exact composition of the cargo has still not been clarified .
The ecological disaster is a major one , possibly unprecedented in scale .
All workers in the fishing , fish farming and aquaculture sectors have already been hit hard .
The chief victims today are the shellfish farmers who were once the most successful producers in Europe .
The frontline victims are the producers or freight forwarders banned in the Vendée and Loire-Atlantique regions .
After shellfish , the slump is now affecting crustacean sales .
It emphasises a number of points deemed crucial at grass roots level .
The first point is that the polluter must accept his liability in full .
The second principle is the ' polluter pays ' principle .
If the FIPOL ceiling is insufficient , and it has clearly been underestimated , then it must be raised .
Our resolution calls for this .
If the increase is not enough then the polluter should pay the balance .
We must act as a catalyst in this crucial issue of maritime pollution .
This time , we must not let inertia win the day .
What is the Commission ' s view of these proposals ?
What decisions has the Commission already taken and what decisions does it plan to take ?
How did the Commission follow up the resolution which the European Parliament adopted on 20 January 2000 ?
We have not , thus far , seen any practical action whatsoever .
There are two aspects , the first being the environmental angle .
These spills , in addition to causing irreparable ecological damage , have devastated local industries .
Effective compensation is essential .
The companies responsible , the ship and the cargo owners must pay up for their negligence .
Parliament adopts a resolution after every maritime disaster .
Generally it puts forward positive technical measures , some of which are adopted in directives .
And , by way of an indication , 10 % is caused by natural pollution .
I would like to advocate this .
This is the right way to go .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
EC-Israel trade agreement
Hence , the relevance of your second question on the effectiveness of the verification system .
He said that this issue was not on the agenda as this only concerned political issues .
The settlement process must proceed by the only possible avenue , i.e. that of dialogue .
Hopefully the Israelis and Palestinians will demonstrate the same optimistic faith in goodwill .
Mr President , Commissioner , the peace process in the Middle East is an extremely delicate matter .
Mr President , in general terms this House shares the concern expressed in Mrs Morgantini ' s question .
This , in my opinion , is the lesson to be learned from such a long-drawn-out affair .
It is also very difficult to establish the origin of the products in question .
I can therefore only concur that it is desirable for some light to be shed on the matter soon .
There are , nonetheless , a number of other important factors which we need to take into consideration .
Israel and the Palestinians are currently involved in intense negotiations concerning their future borders .
I am pleased that the Commissioner shares this view .
Here in the Parliament trade in the Middle East has always been a political flashpoint .
But it is not just an issue of closed borders .
Goods do flow freely from these territories , goods produced in Israeli settlements in the occupied territories .
We have an international agreement and it is being transgressed .
I have a couple of questions , Commissioner .
And is the Commission aware whether they apply that territorial clause correctly or not ?
It is , in fact , an international agreement and a trade agreement .
Mr President , it is universally recognised that rules must be observed .
It is also universally recognised that our partners must also be made to observe the same rules .
Nor would I like our oral question to be perceived as an indictment .
The Oslo protocol envisages an integrated customs authority to encompass both Israel and the Palestinian Authority .
There is I think one final reason why the Commission should be supported .
We are at a delicate stage in relation to the peace agreement .
The choice ought to be simple .
The Commission must guarantee that these things will be done .
Commissioner Vitorino ' s contribution offered some hope that they would be .
The peace process in the Middle East must be given a chance .
It can only be founded upon international law .
It is the EU ' s responsibility to contribute to this .
Thank you very much , Mrs Banotti .
The debate is closed .
( The sitting was suspended at 10.40 a.m. for the vote and resumed at 11 a.m. )
Hence we withdraw our signature to Amendment No 4 .
Thank you very much .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Paragraph 3 :
We are assured that all language versions correspond to the original version .

That concludes the vote .
- Attwooll report ( A5-0038 / 2000 )
We know that the Commission is going to reform the common fisheries policy shortly .
The text of the proposal for a Regulation has been amended quite extensively in the Committee on Fisheries .
Amendment No 1 serves to clarify the text considerably .
Specifically , the data collected must not be intended for purely scientific use .
Amendment No 2 amends the initial Commission proposal .
Amendment No 3 makes it possible to add an important aspect : the collection of environmental data .
Amendment No 5 serves to mitigate the Commission proposal .
Hudghton report ( A5-0036 / 2000 )
The disease was detected in Norway in 1984 and also in Canada ( 1996 ) .
The disease chiefly affects the Scottish salmon industry .
It was detected in this region in May 1998 .
Today , 240 salmon farms are affected by ISA .
We can only declare ourselves in favour of the proposed plan for the gradual elimination of affected fish .
The usefulness of this proposal is limited , to say the least , certainly in the short term .
Resolution on women in decision making ( B5-0180 / 2000 )
But even greater is our regret that we still need such resolutions .
Nor have the electorate felt themselves manipulated by such quotas .
We look forward to that .
Under-representation of women in politics , for example , continues to be the norm .
The importance of enabling greater numbers of women to become involved in politics is , however , recognised .
It is thus up to the European political parties to make themselves more accessible to women .
It gives political parties an important role in building a democratic Europe .
In the 1999 European elections some parties did put forward lists with men and women equally represented .
This is an example of good practice which should be applied more widely .
Moreover , this Parliament has had a woman president since the 1999 elections .
Finland too has just elected a female President .
What is more , women bear the main responsibility for family matters .
Women must be entitled to full time employment on an equal footing with men .
Mandatory legislation must be adopted in order to encourage equality in the workplace .
States must develop a public service offering childcare for working mothers .
We need real equality between men and women in political , economic and social life .
Katiforis report ( A5-0041 / 2000 )
And so we now have no resources left to pay pensions .
We need a completely different system .
Some measures , particularly on tax , must be adopted to encourage private and public investment .
I must condemn this !
An amendment referring to taxation on speculative capital transfers also suffered the same fate .
- ( FR ) Our position is determined by the nature of our project for Europe .
The resolution turns its back on such an approach .
Joint resolution on the shipwreck of the ( RC B5-0181 / 2000 )
We do , however , deplore the indecisive nature of the resolution .
We do already know , however , that it will be extensive .
Every day , further pollution increases the toll .
The degradation does not affect just business turnover but also valuable parts of our heritage .
This is just scandalous .
Quite obviously all victims should receive 100 % compensation .
Everyone must play their own part .
Let me remind you that the Erika was registered in Valletta .
Katiforis report ( A5-0017 / 2000 )
Hence the importance of our amendments , which sought to achieve this .
Effectiveness and excessive regulation are not compatible .
Food safety with regard to seafood is also of prime importance .
That concludes the vote .
Adjournment of the session
The session is adjourned .
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 2 March 2000 .
There was a grave danger of this House 's reputation being damaged .
Thank you , Mrs Gröner .
I fully agree with your remarks and have even been proactive in responding to your wishes .
They now have two television channels .
We have two German channels as well , so happy viewing everybody .
I hope you enjoy it .
Madam President , I would simply like to add to what Mrs Gröner has said .
It is not only in Strasbourg that this happens .
Thank you , Mrs Roure , for this additional information .
We will assess the situation when in Brussels too , and then see what should be done .
Madam President , I would like to talk about a quite different matter , which concerns Iran .
Thank you , Mr Jonckheer .
I will happily comply with your request .
It would have been better if she had obtained channels in all languages .
I hope we shall be getting a Danish channel next time .
Thank you , Mr Blak .
As you can see , Mrs Banotti , you still have your work cut out for you .
Thank you , Mr Seppänen .
Special European Council ( 23-24 March 2000 in Lisbon )
Together , we can make the Lisbon Summit a success .
Now is the time to do this because there is currently a good chance of succeeding .
Our summit will therefore be on sustainable development and employment .
These are operational points which cannot be dismissed .
We must disseminate best practice in all fields and endeavour to advance it at European level .
I would like to raise a few issues from our perspective .
The tools are surely known to all .
We might mention the skills deficit as one example .
Madam President , today 's debate is welcome , necessary and timely .
Too many of our European markets are still too fragmented .
Not enough European small and medium-sized enterprises grow into world-beaters .
There are too few entrepreneurs in Europe . There is too little enterprise in Europe .
Where we do , too little of it is converted into market product and services .
This truly would be an enabling exercise .
Mr Barón Crespo has described it as a Social Democrat project .
I am moved to describe it myself rather as an enlightened Liberal project .
It is a trap .
We can do that by enabling Europe and its peoples to achieve our full potential .
We would like to believe this , but we cannot .
We know all of this .
In short , we have heard nothing to suggest that the citizen will be anything more than a customer .
We have heard nothing to suggest that opting for sustainable development would be a guiding factor in long-awaited growth .
Unfortunately , nothing is changing and nothing is going to change .
Your globalisation of the economy is neither necessary nor inevitable .
You are thus acting as accomplices in this process .
Mr President , the Lisbon Summit will produce a further string of fine words to dazzle us with .
It is public consumption and the price of money which definitely must not rise .
In Denmark , we have had combined growth of 20 % , compared with 10 % in the EU .
That is my first question .
My second question is about the Employment Summit .
Mr President-in-Office , you concluded on a vaguely ideological note , which is fair enough .
This is what we must counter if we are to guarantee the knowledge-based economy of the future .
Furthermore , the way in which this European Council is being prepared is a good illustration of this .
Firstly , there is the seriousness and depth of the document presented in January .
I congratulate you , Mr President-in-Office .
There are , after all , huge differences within the Member States .
This is a very serious risk .
In Europe , everyone should be able to keep up .
This policy will not allow you to keep your promise of full employment .
This has cost jobs and the trend is continuing .
The result is sobering .
We must not build a Europe of the haves and the have-nots .
Despite satisfactory economic growth , the drop in unemployment is stagnating .
Specific instruments , such as interest rates and the exchange rate , are no longer at our disposal .
Is the Council acting upon this ?
And if so , what measures does the Council Presidency have in mind ?
But is this reflected in the policy ?
Has a decision been made in favour of selective growth in such policy ?
It is important to take the work where unemployment is at its highest .
This may result in the further depopulation of certain disadvantaged areas .
My main question relating to this is , what is actually new ?
What is new , of course , is social protection .
I do wonder why public health cannot be mentioned in this respect .
We have experienced this .
This should not happen .
It is their defensive nature .
So it is possible for Europeans to match this .
There are other countries which appeared far less capable of doing this .
Mr President , Prime Minister Guterres has been most convincing .
The proposals made by the presidency mark a clean break from the usual Community jargon .
The citizens of Europe do not want a theological debate , they want to see tangible action .
The most minor of accidents is depicted as an irreparable ecological disaster .
People are asked to be flexible , and to embark on the breakneck quest for productivity .
Europe has indeed become highly productive , and would not otherwise be the world ' s leading exporter .
Nevertheless , the predominant rhetoric always centres on wage restraint .
I am not making the case against stability policies nor against necessary structural reforms .
New technologies will change the shape of a good many professions .
Electronic commerce will cut out many middlemen .
The Union has always succeeded when it has set itself hard and fast objectives .
( The President cut the speaker off ) I still have many points I would like to make .
Mr President , we place our trust in you .
Mr President , I should like to thank Prime Minister Guterres for his very committed speech .
The main message is that the individual should be at the centre of the EU ' s policies .
These proposals are not new but they are becoming more topical .
Or have industrialisation , nuclear power and biotechnology led to greater justice in the past ?
I wonder what has happened to it !
Or has the evidence recently supplied of the ' Echelon ' global bugging system already been forgotten ?
My own experience of these industries , however , is that they are managing really rather well .
In many cases , they have far too much capital , and in many cases they are spoiled .
I have seen IT companies which are unbelievably spoiled .
Above all , integration mechanisms should be created .
Reading the preparatory documents gives rise to certain fears in this regard .
But how can we guarantee greater convergence of all these vastly different processes ?
The conclusion of the document issued by the presidency on 12 January holds the key .
If we consider our gross national product , that ought actually to be possible .
We now need to ask ourselves why this is the case .
Here I need only mention mobile telephones .
We have banned them here in the Chamber , rightly , because they are instruments of torment .
And in Europe we are world leaders in this field .
Where then do Europe 's shortcomings actually lie ?
We in Europe are deficient where training is concerned .
Europe lacks , as has already been stated , entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial spirit .
There are too few young people who are willing to take the risk of being self-employed .
In Europe we are also still a long way from a common domestic market .
We have 15 domestic markets and a common European internal market .
For electronic commerce we need common , clear , European rules .
We need a European patent at a reasonable price ; we do not have that yet either .
This European patent is so expensive that it is not competitive with other patents .
There are many challenges involved with creating that full employment .
This is the great challenge , the great importance of Lisbon .
There are other areas that we must look at .
Who could challenge such an ambition ?
I hope that we will achieve them , but I sound a warning note .
We live in the time of IDEA - the Internet digital electronic age .
That sums up what we are trying to achieve on the e-side , the electronic side , of life .
That must be right .
We cannot just focus on the new economy . We must pay attention to the old .
We were forced to experience this several times in the nineties .
This scenario has moved into the foreseeable future .
That is why full employment actually needs to be right at the top of the agenda .
We need to set a growth target of at least 3 % .
The aim of full employment cannot be achieved by economic policy alone .
The Europe of innovation and the information society also need to be commandeered to reach this target .
We are a long way from it today .
In adopting the Luxembourg Process the Heads of State and Government achieved tangible successes .
Since 1997 , however , the really significant results have failed to materialise .
So far , the Cologne Employment Pact has not been able to be invested with sufficient content .
This is the most effective way of reducing unemployment .
In this context the Ciampi Group also mentions the European company statute .
We do not want the basic unrefined European company model .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , do you know how Archimedes expounded his theory of the lever ?
He would say , ' Give me a fulcrum and I will lift the world . '
That simply leaves the fulcrum .
The fulcrum is provided by resources .
It is thus up to you to create them .
The straitjacket of Agenda 2000 will not provide you with the requisite means .
There is no need to add to this what I will call the digital divide .
Indeed , to whom will you offer this information and knowledge society ?
This is not your objective .
The public services have played a key role throughout the entire existence of our European social model .
But we cannot stop there .
This is a major task , but we are relying on you to see it through .
They are a tool for political decision making .
And yet they incorporate institutional measures whose influence we will be able to assess in the medium term .
They will bolster the role of the European Council in the decision-making process .
What we are doing here has certain implications .
It is up to each and every one of us to work on this .
Lastly , a final word on social cohesion .
But we do not feel that social exclusion can be eradicated in a piecemeal fashion .
We know that this requires a proactive approach and that we can count on your determination .
However , I would conclude by asking : which is going to come first ?
Can we really achieve that full employment without unleashing that entrepreneurial talent ?
Here , too , we need standards of excellence and a Luxembourg process .
I wish the President-in-Office all the best in the pursuit of his ambitions .
That would give you another ally for your policy .
Europe needs to achieve full employment .
All of this has to be done thinking of the European citizen .
I hope that it does just that !
The prime concern of the European citizens , after health , is probably employment .
Within this concern , employment is linked to competitiveness .
All of this is absolutely essential . We need technological change and institutional reform .
I would like to draw your attention to three specific points .
The first point concerns corporate governance .
So I would ask that this point be given due attention too .
We therefore hope that this Lisbon Summit will help to change the present model of female employment .
The fact that Parliament has a crucial role to play in this is also important .
Obviously , in order to achieve this , there are two issues which are crucial in all areas .
To give an example , in Europe we have a textile industry .
, Commission .
Firstly , we are not starting from scratch .
Europe has the advantages of the single currency and the single market to build on .
Now then , we have to increase productivity in these areas sufficiently to sustain economic growth without inflation .
However , we must be careful .
Therefore , our responsibility is both economic and social .
In Lisbon , we will have to take some practical decisions .
These were huge investments , and they were in modern infrastructures .
There is therefore a very clear strategy for Lisbon .
The problem is simple .
It is clear that , at this point , the three processes have to be combined .
You see , all the different pieces are coming together to give direction to Lisbon .
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon .
The debate is closed .
( The sitting was suspended at 8.15 p.m. and resumed at 9. p.m. )
There are three reasons for this .
So please , keep to the speaking times and we will make good progress !
Environmental dimension in the development process
The challenge for us all consists in integrating social and environmental considerations .
It could be given higher priority , but it is in fact under way .
Matters are organised rather less well in the majority of developing countries .
In this context , aid can play an important role .
So far , there remains , however , a lot to be done in terms of developing methods .
I was responsible for the preparations for this second reading .
This is something we ought to support , a fact which also emerges from Amendment No 11 .
This question will then , at all events , return to Parliament .
I hope that the vote will ensure that this will also become Parliament ' s proposal .
Might I just ask for one more thing ?
The fact is , we shall need further consultations .
I would therefore propose without further ado that the vote could take place on Wednesday .
It is now our task to counteract this .
The greenhouse effect and deforestation also have a considerable impact .
From this perspective we cannot fail to be satisfied .
The EU ' s framework programmes do not extend to developing countries .
But why not ?
It has been made easier for Eastern Europe to participate .
To do this , sufficient financial support is of course necessary .
So for many of us this is an interesting learning experience .
The previous regulation expired at the end of 1999 .
This places the Commission and Europe in an increasingly difficult situation .
Hence our desire to conclude the process of adoption in the near future .
I would like to comment briefly on each of these issues .
Hence the problem has , to a large extent , been resolved .
For these reasons the Commission does not support the proposed Amendment No 10 on bank guarantees .
With regard to these two types of amendments , the position of the Commission is as follows .
Furthermore we are concerned that its adoption would lead to a conciliation process .
Therefore the Commission does not support it .
Such a unit is , in fact , already operational although we intend to strengthen it further .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Our services say that it is possible to do so then .
Conservation and sustainable forest management
( Mr Bouwman interrupted the President . )
( DE ) Mr President , I think you are mistaken !
There is another report first .
I would be happy to speak now , but there is another report first .
Please forgive me . My files have got in rather a muddle .
That does happen from time to time in the hectic activity of the night sitting .
Forget what I have said so far .
We will start again .
Thank you for that .
Thank you very much for this generous gift to my colleagues .
The biodiversity of our planet is at stake .
He has identified some valid points , certain aspects of which I would like to examine more closely .
It would seem to me absolutely essential to reflect on the scope of the regulation .
Firstly , programmes must be more closely targeted at the rehabilitation of tropical forests .
This implies respect for the indigenous peoples who depend on forest ecosystems .
Thank you , Commissioner Nielson .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Ship-generated waste and cargo residues
Now , Mr Jarzembowski , is the great moment !
Mr President , Commissioner , we are debating a directive which is extremely - I repeat extremely - rigorous .
We have been discussing the Erika disaster here for the past couple of weeks .
Normal shipping operations account for double this amount .
Not only that .
In other words , this affects our own habitat .
I do not need to say any more concerning the motives underlying this directive .
These will re-emerge in some shape or form .
I would mainly like to home in on one very important point .
I would once again refer to the Erika , but there are also other examples .
We are also agreed that the polluter-pays principle must apply .
There is no financial incentive .
Let me illustrate this quite clearly .
Northern countries apply a system in which this financial element is handled in a different way .
Everyone pays , whether they dump their waste in the sea or dispose of it elsewhere .
Experience and scientific research has shown that this seems to work .
This is , in fact , what we are opting for .
If the percentage is 90 % , so be it .
I fear that this will be opted for in practice .
This will also be the key point of discussion for the foreseeable future .
I do believe that somehow we will make it .
We are after all at one with the Council on three points .
They must therefore be provided .
Secondly , all ships , regardless of the flag they fly , have to dispose of their waste .
Thirdly , the costs must be borne by the ship .
We agree on these points .
That means that we want to have an effective system .
The really decisive difference is the issue of how the disposal costs are charged to the ship .
Mr Bouwman has , of course , already explained this .
There are two precedents .
Surely if people have already paid the disposal costs then they will actually dispose of the waste in port .
This second system has proved to be ineffective , otherwise why would the Mediterranean Sea be so dirty ?
Why would the North Sea be so dirty ?
Because for lack of adequate controls the polluter-pays principle does not work !
That is the decisive issue .
We are prepared to reach an agreement with the Council .
But so far the Council has rejected any serious agreement with us .
For these reasons support our ' no-special-fee ' system .
Perhaps then we will reach a reasonable compromise with the Council in the conciliation procedure .
There are a few points at stake tomorrow .
This is what this is about , and a majority of us have said as much in debates here .
This scandal is not acceptable in the eyes of the Council either .
The conflict now is ultimately over the issue of how payments will be made .
Nothing would change .
There would be no financial pressure on ships to obey the rules .
I think that this is also about the credibility of the Union and , in particular , Parliament .
This consistent directive is an important step towards doing this .
Mr President , Commissioner , rapporteur , congratulations on your report .
You have said so yourself just now : we desperately need this directive .
It is a sound directive .
Ports must be equipped with reception facilities .
Inspection is on its way , at long last .
Member States must also impose sanctions when these rules are broken .
This is very important .
This is good for the environment .
As such , this directive is already coming into effect in a sense .
How do we charge the fees ?
We are all agreed on the polluter pays principle .
Where is the best financial incentive , to use your words ?
I have sounded out a number of people on this subject .
The opinions are divided .
Habits , apparently , are also divided .
In fact , ports in one and the same region apply different standards and percentages .
There are also ports which change percentages at the last minute , if I may say so .
0.01 is clearly not a substantial part .
Fellow MEPs , we must rescue this directive and keep it come what may .
It is now evident , particularly from this debate , that there is a bone of contention here .
I would like to say that we have made some progress here .
Mr President , every day five million items of solid waste are thrown overboard from ships .
This is an extraordinarily important report .
The aim of both is to prevent discharges into the sea .
The Baltic is affected every year by a great many oil spills of greatly varying sizes .
In Swedish waters alone , there are hundreds of these each year .
We can never in a million years solve Europe ' s environmental problems alone .
There will come a time when we shall be able to meet imperatives of this kind .
First , every port must be equipped with the necessary facilities for the treatment of waste .
Secondly , polluters must pay , naturally .
I believe that the work we are discussing today is a great step forward .
As you know , the Commission is extremely concerned about marine pollution .
And this is where the problem lies .
Perhaps we could incorporate the word " significant " into the text instead of setting a fixed percentage .
I could go on , but the two reasons have already been stated .
We are all working towards the same goal .
The only difference of opinion is over how best to achieve this goal .
Many thanks , Mr President .
I would like to reiterate my appreciation to the rapporteur and the rest of the Committee .
Thank you , Madam Vice-President .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Technical roadside inspection of commercial vehicles
A good Commissioner should listen !
Can that be deducted from the time ?
I do not believe that this is necessary here .
I wanted actually to relate this comment to the report before us .
The President has read out a very laborious title .
I think that we simply cannot do enough for road traffic safety .
There is a consensus on that .
This directive on lorry inspections should quite simply make a contribution to this .
We are seeing a slight fall in the number of those killed and injured on the roads .
The causes are often precisely technical defects .
We must not sit back and accept this .
After all , a lorry does around 150 000 kilometres a year .
This is an inconceivably high number compared with a private car .
Now Europeans are obviously not so well behaved that they can manage without checks .
In its common position , the Council makes no mention of any arrangements .
That would not make any sense .
Neither is it very European .
It ought therefore to be put to the vote first tomorrow .
Then we would not have any procedural problems with this .
So , put Amendment No 3 to the vote first .
It would then replace Amendment No 2 .
Mr President , everything has been said .
That is why I think that this Amendment No 3 which Mr Piecyk has drafted as rapporteur is excellent .
He has completely avoided the word ' harmonisation ' .
But he has said what this is all about .
Given the danger to the passengers and also other drivers this would , however , be necessary .
The second argument is that there must be no distortions of competition in the Community .
This lies at the heart of the difference between Parliament 's views and the common position .
That is the equivalent to a medium-sized town being wiped off the face of the earth every year .
Firstly , the safety argument that we have already heard about .
Thirdly , there are also the environmental benefits - the possibility of ensuring quieter and less polluting vehicles .
I welcome this initiative and I hope it can be put into effect as soon as possible .
The rapporteur has adopted a perfectly good position in this issue , in the final analysis .
This should not , however , slow down the prompt implementation of the directive .
The drivers of thirty-three of them received fines , and sixteen received a warning .
Three vehicles were prohibited from continuing their journey .
Only thirteen were in fully acceptable condition .
A considerable number of the vehicles in bad condition were from non-member countries .
Our group supports Amendment No 3 and hopes the new version of the directive will come into force promptly .
It is precisely in those countries that employment permits and work contracts are not checked up on .
Road safety is a serious matter .
We can never assume too much responsibility when it comes to human life .
It is certain that the rapporteur is entirely correct in saying that the title is very long .
We also accept Amendment No 1 , and I would like to refer to what Mr Bouwman said .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Closing of the session
I declare the 1999-2000 session closed .
( The sitting was closed at 10.41 p.m. )
Opening of the session
I declare resumed the 2000-2001 session of the European Parliament .
It was however initially scheduled , I thought , for noon tomorrow .
You know as well as I do that this matter is quite controversial and well reported in the media .
I should prefer for this vote to be held tomorrow .
Mr President , we do not have anything against postponing the vote .
We have nothing against postponement , with this proviso .
The competent services have informed me that tomorrow ' s list of subjects will be rather lengthy .
After all , it came as a complete surprise that the vote was planned for 12.00 p.m.
If we are all in agreement , that is what the arrangement will be .
Annual legislative programme ( continuation )
But this also means that the Commission faces an immense challenge .
This could also be described in terms of carrying out or implementing the subsidiarity principle .
That said , we do not want to bureaucratise Europe and neither do we want to centralise it .
That is not how we envisage Europe to be !
Moving onto another point : the Commission has passed a long list of its intentions to Parliament .
Exchanging lists in this way is not an ideal way to engage in dialogue .
Therefore , in future , we should think of something different .
It is not about preventing globalisation , we would not succeed there in any case .
The only way forward is to form this global outlook on the basis of our own values and diversity .
You are in the process of drafting a communication strategy for the enlargement of the European Union .
Mr President , my Group would like to welcome the annual legislative programme .
However , we have some concerns about the process .
I came to this procedure as a relatively new Member of this House .
I understand that it has been the normal tradition to obediently produce these lists .
All this sits rather uneasily with endless lists .
With this in mind , we produced a one-page resolution highlighting key areas .
This would get away from the shopping-list approach and give more political focus .
It would allow Parliament to participate fully in the process , not just by swapping shopping lists with you .
What we would like to do is catch the imagination of Europe 's citizens .
It contains some positive elements and some less positive elements .
This shows a general decline in working conditions in a number of important sectors .
And after the White Paper we shall probably have to wait a long time before we have the directive .
Let me give one example of this .
Today , a proposal for a directive on electrical and electronic waste has been announced .
This proposal has already been put forward several times , but has never been tabled .
President Prodi , a friendly word of advice .
I believe this is an important right , which should be left in the domain of national Member States .
In my own country , the tax regime is quite innovative in many ways .
This cannot be said of many of the other Member States .
An information technology revolution is certainly upon us .
We cannot be passengers when these changes take place .
It is perhaps difficult to know who is going to provide the salutary shock , and when .
That is often the case with historical new departures .
It is Orwellian to a T. Under the heading of ' decentralisation ' , centralisation is taking place .
Under the heading of ' democracy ' , democracy is being dismantled .
The elected representatives of the people would no longer be the last to be informed .
In the EU , the legislature has been transferred to the executive .
I stand by my words . Here is my signature to the transparency that was promised ' .
Thank you , if there is , in fact , anything to say thank-you for .
I would particularly like to thank Mr Poettering for what he had to say in this connection .
The Commission must not stand idly by in a situation of this kind .
It has a duty to see to it that the solidarity enshrined in the Treaties is upheld .
It seems as if we are talking about two different documents .
We want to project a much stronger , united front as far as this European foreign policy is concerned .
But the instruments involved are also an important factor .
They help in the analysis of non-military crises and help us to act on them quickly .
This is about very concrete issues , such as transport capacity .
Take the enormous cattle losses Mongolia has suffered .
We know that there are funds available in TACIS and ECHO within the European Union .
But why are we not helping out ?
This is because there are too many bureaucratic hurdles .
In short , operational implementation is central .
Relations with Russia are of vital importance .
I hope that the European Commission too , will protest in the strongest terms to the Russian authorities .
I should now like to make a few comments on economic and social matters .
One of the Commission ' s initiatives , which deserves a high priority , is the e-Europe initiative .
Yesterday we discussed the Lisbon Summit for the economic and social revival of Europe .
Full employment does not mean the total absence of any form of unemployment .
In this context , the e-Europe initiative comes at just the right moment .
What we should be doing is educating our own intelligent young people and keeping them in Europe .
Surely this provides the rest of Europe with an example to be followed ?
Such power must at all times be rigorously justified and clearly explained .
A 15-page general summary does not exactly do justice to the 500 initiatives cited in the annex .
The Commission President 's speech this morning raises three concerns in my mind .
The second concern relates to budgets .
Lastly , a word of caution about the question of information .
It looks as if we are running into difficulties with our framework agreement .
A lot of other people have also said that here today .
But what is the situation now ?
I hope that Mr Prodi is listening .
Two : the internal market .
In all probability , we ought to start work in the field of administrative law as well .
Three : the preparatory documents .
Delays in transposition are an endemic problem in the Commission .
The question is in which direction this Commission is heading .
In this respect , I would like to refer to the codification of Community law .
What has the reform of the Commission to do with the internal market ?
The answer is a lot .
This guiding principle is mainly the protection of the Community ' s financial interests .
Let us consider the intended reform of the infringement procedure .
What is the intention there ?
How can these things be selected in a purely arbitrary way .
Thank you , Mr Prodi , for your presentation and your documentation .
Congratulations on using the Internet for the general public - a very good idea .
I will start with trade .
We agree with you that we need a rules-based trading system .
It is essential .
Innovation and knowledge - very appropriate for a new century .
How much innovation has taken place in the Commission , or indeed in the Parliament may I say ?
What is the dissemination for the new ideas , the new products , the new comparisons of socio-economic systems ?
Follow-up again , please .
This is an excellent way in which to begin the century .
It is a disgrace and I hope that you will take it up when you look at legislation .
I hope there will be a follow-up to the Science White Paper .
Mr President , the internal reform of the Commission has begun .
We welcome that !
For the moment we have a series of measures and a White Paper .
Go for it !
However , I would like to point out one fault in the document .
Now that we are establishing new measures , how do we know they will be used ?
Only you know the answer to this secret .
The lack of motivation amongst excellent civil servants is serious .
We must take action and the example should come from above .
Far more resources are lost through an ineffective and unmotivated administration .
Go for it , Mr Prodi .
Your task must be an historic task .
You are not the first to try it . We hope that you succeed .
In fact we have not had a legislative programme for several years now .
We welcome the Luxembourg procedure .
But does that mean that we have done the job in terms of legislation in the social area ?
I think not .
But is it just about updating ?
There are other areas .
She had worked in a range of European countries for high technology companies .
Thirteen months into the job she was dismissed without notice and without reason .
She still has no reason for the dismissal .
These are the gaps we need to plug .
Let us do it in the new medium-term Social Action Programme .
I would make the same call for coherence in another area , the management of the pigmeat crisis .
My final point concerns the preparation of the budget for 2001 .
Can I take this opportunity to welcome the programme in the context of the five-year strategic plan .
Therefore , opening up the invisible cities of decision-making in Europe to the citizenry is absolutely vital .
Can I welcome the annual programme in particular because there was one omission from the five-year plan .
I do not accept that this will simply be a one-off event .
In such circumstances , it would be mad to slash the budget to this extent .
We should be spending more to alleviate this crisis rather than contemplating spending less .
That is a very good example , but what happened to the other five ?
It seems that the Commission has not responded .
One out of six is simply not good enough .
We now have an Intergovernmental Conference looking at the Treaties again .
Mr President , the Commission has submitted a promising work programme for the year 2000 .
We cannot do other than give this programme our full backing .
However , there are also some unfortunate gaps in it .
I do not see the work programme make any mention whatsoever of tourism .
We have long been promised measures for this sector .
It requires improvement as a matter of urgency , but nothing is happening .
But the Commission has other important tasks to perform besides those of a legislative nature .
As a citizen of the country in question , I do not object to this modus operandi .
This debate has clearly revealed the vital importance of our cooperation .
There has to be a break .
Today , concern was expressed over the length of the list of subjects to be put to the vote .
Of course , certain areas are missing from this list .
There is therefore a series of issues on which we must work together this year .
In addition , it is vital for Parliament and the Commission to work well together to make these decisions .
I am fully aware of this .
We talked about the levels of governability which need to be adopted in Europe , not decentralisation ..
It is for this reason that I have continued to push for a White Paper on governability .
We are in the process of creating something completely new .
And in order to do this we must work together .
Each year , we present a report on the actions we have undertaken .
These are the plans for a great European Union , plans with a specific objective .
Do we want to play a leading role in this globalisation ?
Do we want behave responsibly in respect of developing countries and the Third World in this matter ?
I feel that this is an extremely important strategy .
We cannot stifle these countries at such a decisive moment as this .
Unfortunately , I did not receive any answer to this question .
No , not this time either !
Thank you very much , Mrs Thors .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon .
Cocoa and chocolate products
The common position is a balanced compromise and we should seek not to change it too much !
The Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection has , however , adopted two important amendments .
I welcome these even though , in my opinion , they do not go far enough .
Unfortunately , this restriction does not provide any guarantees for the future .
Mr President , chocolate was the topic of a stormy debate at first reading .
This was justified and not without results .
Justified because the original proposal focused exclusively on the internal market .
The discussion was not without results either .
Upon serious analysis of the common position , it has to be said that democracy works .
Should we assent to other legislation ?
We only wanted tropical fats ; the common position provides an exhaustive list of them .
We wanted an impact study .
We are getting one , two and a half years after the directive has entered into force .
We wanted the Commission to draft an amendment proposal , if need be .
We did not want comitology for essential amendments .
We are getting codecision .
Many of us in this House were displeased with the Commission proposal .
Even if none of the amendments survive , the result is still worth seeing .
I would like to finish off with the following thought .
In the debate on chocolate , the word ethics was used more than once .
If a victory is achieved , one should be able to enjoy it too .
Perhaps we ought to learn to do this one day .
I want to pay tribute to Mr Lannoye .
He is a parliamentarian of considerable skill , and he has argued his case throughout with force and conviction .
We believe that this is good for consumers .
They get a wider choice of product and separate and distinctive labelling .
Quality argues for itself .
You can have additional labelling if you want .
After all , chocolate is also considered a stimulant , unfortunately .
This agony will come to an end today .
We politicians need to show some prudence in this respect .
After all , there is no accounting for taste .
The European Parliament cannot and should not prescribe a harmonised euro taste .
After all , chocolate is not exactly a product like cigarettes .
There are , of course , other interests which need to be taken into consideration .
Prudence is called for once again .
After all , there are conflicting interests involved .
The Council ' s common position as it is now before us attempts to accommodate all these interests .
We feel that it is lacking in one or two areas .
Most members of the Liberal Group can tolerate this precarious balance .
The addition of any other fats spoils the flavour .
Harmonisation was essential in the name of the free movement of goods .
Once again we see the concept of profits for the few triumph over quality for all .
This would involve more than USD 300 million for the Ivory Coast alone .
To say that they are extremely worried is an understatement .
We have therefore tabled a motion to reject the Council ' s common position .
The small specialist chocolate-makers came to warn Members of Parliament at January ' s part-session in Strasbourg .
Mr President , consumer protection is our prime concern .
The issue of the directive on the production and sale of chocolate is thus just as important .
Some Member States have enjoyed a derogation from this law since acceding to the Union .
That is fine , let everyone have their own chocolate bar in their own home .
I therefore urge you to support Amendments Nos 29 and 18 .
Tastes are certainly culturally conditioned .
We are defending the concept of authentic chocolate .
Cocoa butter is the very essence of chocolate .
Let us respect the guarantee of flavour that it offers .
It is not enough to publish a White Paper on food safety in order to reassure consumers .
Today ' s vote is a symbolic one .
We want none of your compromise chocolate , we are too familiar already with the Federalist recipe .
What then ?
It is a legal obligation with regard to the Ivory Coast and African farmers .
Finally , it is a question of honesty , of morality .
Humans are continuing to play the sorcerer ' s apprentice , juggling with food safety .
Here , courtesy of industrial lobbying , we have chocolate with added vegetable fats .
This is the crux of the problem .
There is a clear lack of transparency , and yet we distinguish butter from margarine .
We must not mislead the consumer by giving the name ' chocolate ' to just anything .
Europe must not adopt the lowest possible standards .
It must ensure the quality of food products and consumer health .
In the light of these principles , we are unable to endorse the aims of this directive .
Rejecting it would represent a strong message to our citizens and a responsible attitude adopted by Parliament .
But is this actually true ?
I will start with the information for the consumer .
The Commission has freely admitted that there is no foolproof detection method .
The margin of error is 2 % .
At 5 % , this is even 50 % more .
This seems to be unacceptable to me .
Which is it and which will it be ?
Finally , ladies and gentlemen , I really need to get something else off my chest .
It is wonderful , but millions of people in Europe also enjoy the British product .
None of them come to any harm in the process .
Whatever its content they are happy to call this product chocolate .
It is insulting for us to play semantic games about the definition of this word .
The citizens we represent are not fools .
I have no doubt that this compromise will help the overall market increase .
I consider that there is really no need for this directive and that it is unnecessary .
In this area there is no need for harmonisation at EU level .
Instead , the previous system can be retained .
I think that is completely unnecessary .
However , since that is no longer possible , I think that the common position is acceptable .
I am very much in favour of clear labelling .
The same cannot be said for this directive which we had absolutely no need of .
Today ' s consumer has had enough of being deceived .
What is the Council putting forward to solve the problem ?
A tiny piece of difficult-to-read information , hidden on the back of the product wrapper .
This is not what we are asking for .
The consumer will not be able to make an informed choice .
We want the information to be obviously and clearly displayed on the front side of the product wrapper .
This is what we achieved in the European Parliament at first reading .
We know that the cost of the fats capable of replacing cocoa is much less .
That is why big industry is so much in favour of them .
Making things cheaper and cheaper : what image of Europe does that present ?
So what is to be done ?
This is what the consumer wants .
And let us , most especially , support our rapporteur , Mr Lannoye .
Thank you very much , Mrs Grossetête .
Cocoa and chocolate products ( continuation )
We are talking about harmonisation , the harmonisation of tastes , of habits and , almost , of cultures .
It is an ethical matter .
We have made formal commitments to them .
So what is the reason for this time limit ?
The potential impact must be investigated in advance , that is clear .
What is now threatening to happen is at complete odds with this .
Should free trade be granted absolute priority ?
Mr Lannoye says that he has gone back to retable some of the original amendments .
After all , this is not a product which is a threat to people ' s health .
Neither Scandinavian , Belgian nor British chocolate is dangerous .
The whole issue is therefore somewhat ridiculous .
Where is the benefit in that for the Third World ?
Nor can we say that one kind tastes better and another worse .
Let us not , therefore , make the same mistake as Dom Mintoff .
It would be more like the kind of warning you find on cigarette packets .
The chocolate war has been raging within the EU for 25 years .
It has made ourselves as politicians and the EU as an institution look faintly ridiculous .
We ought therefore to adhere precisely to the common position .
Mr President , I am Belgian and I am not opposed to the common position .
So I know what I bought .
I do concur with the rapporteur on one point .
The producers of cocoa beans , namely the small farmers in the poor third-world countries , are vulnerable .
It constitutes a delicate compromise which was difficult to achieve but which is well-balanced .
Only those substances listed in the annex may be used .
They are all of tropical origin and produced in ACP countries .
Parliament ' s recommendation on second reading contains two amendments .
The first amendment reiterates the Commission ' s policy , and this can be approved .
We may agree with something or we may not .
If it has already responded , what was the tenor of its response ?
Ladies and gentlemen , I understand the political , institutional and compassionate motives behind these speeches .
I would like to thank Mr Queiró , Mr Seguro and Mr Pacheco Pereira for their speeches .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
There are basically two reasons .
Because of a misunderstanding that request was not made in time .
To pursue the voting as a block vote today would , to my mind , be unfortunate .
The other reason has to do with comitology .
( The vote was postponed until the following day )
( Parliament approved the common position ( as amended ) )
Amendment No 6 :
Mr President , I just wanted to point out what repercussions a split vote would have .
( Parliament approved the common position ( as amended ) )
( Parliament approved the common position ( as amended ) )
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Recommendation for second reading of the Fernández Martín report ( A5-0048 / 2000 )
These concerns are , however , drowned out in a hotchpotch of irresolute declarations .
These historic links and expert knowledge must be made to serve the conservation of this ecosystem .
The department of French Guyana , in particular , is almost entirely covered by this type of vegetation .
Recommendation for second reading of the Bouwman report ( A5-0043 / 2000 )
In the jungle of maritime transport , such behaviour is , unfortunately , frequently encountered .
We can only applaud the proposed European directive which would make it possible to apply these principles .
But what about vessels from outside the Community ?
Will they also be asked for certificates ?
And how will vessels that pass through our waters without docking into port be inspected ?
We know only too well the pressure of competition in maritime transport .
This is why we need to find an alternative .
Such an alternative is offered to us in an amendment which I supported .
These charges would be used to finance the relevant installations up to 90 % .
This is absolutely scandalous and intolerable .
This system seems a fair one to me , and I therefore voted in favour of it .
- ( FR ) This proposed directive is most welcome within the European Union .
The real problem , however , is the application and observance of these standards !
Moreover , we wish to set the level for mandatory inspection at 25 % of all vessels .
All I can do is urge this House to do as much .
Recommendation for second reading of the Piecyk report ( A5-0040 / 2000 )
( The sitting was suspended at 12.35 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
EU Charter of Fundamental Rights
This resolution mandates the European parliamentary delegation inside the Convention .
We should avoid becoming obsessed with the question of subsidiarity .
The effect of the Charter will be steady and gradual rather than sudden and revolutionary .
I strongly commend the resolution .
What is there to fear in a Charter of Fundamental Rights ?
Fundamental rights will have to be defined in the face of fresh hazards .
This is how we must see the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Madam President , Europe is founded upon fundamental rights .
Fundamental rights can create identity and citizenship .
Quite simply , freedom of movement demands a basis of guaranteed , fundamental rights .
Enlargement of the Union without guaranteed rights could even turn into a fiasco and delay our economic development .
A binding Charter is an indispensable requirement and a necessary part of a much-needed constitution .
These complications ought to be studied more closely .
The Charter should be easy to communicate to citizens and be clear to them .
It should not be divided into two or contain a whole lot of references .
The Charter must be binding and embrace the European institutions .
This project will give rise to more powerful European individuals .
Social fundamental rights form part and parcel of traditional fundamental rights .
These rights should therefore be included in the first part of the charter .
This is not the case at all .
This is , in fact , a reaction to a second common misconception .
I would also like to comment on international treaties with regard to social fundamental rights .
We will need to conduct this general discussion then too .
This is a misconception in my view .
Thinking in terms of a hierarchy of fundamental rights is a trap which we should avoid .
Specific women ' s rights do not exist .
They have successfully stated the importance of this matter for the European Parliament , Europe and its citizens .
The area of competence of the Committee on Petitions justifies its interest in the framing of the charter .
So our opinion stresses two key points which the rapporteurs , moreover , seem to share .
Firstly , the necessary visibility of the charter as a point of reference for the citizens .
This necessitates clear and concise drafting within a single , comprehensible text .
The natural outcome of this determination is the inclusion of the future charter among the Treaties .
Madam President , we are holding this debate at exactly the right time .
Fundamental rights are recognised in our constitutions . The Member States of the European Union respect fundamental rights .
So what is this Charter for ?
Being European has an added positive effect .
This is the background against which we are working .
It is important at a time when the European Union is experiencing upheaval at its very centre .
The charter must contribute to this .
It is intended , rather , to say what Parliament expects of the convention .
To this end , I should like to stress two points .
In the first place , what do we expect to obtain from this exercise ?
We want more than this .
My second point is to do with its content .
Fundamental rights are of secondary importance in treaties these days .
If they are included at all , this is done so in a completely chaotic format .
Ladies and gentlemen , the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be an essential stage in the construction of Europe .
This is a formal request which we are making to the French Government .
There are , however , two points that I would like to mention here .
The rights that we are defining , if they are to be fundamental , must be applicable to everyone .
Well , this cannot truly exist unless it is based on a solid legal standard .
This is a major issue for the guaranteeing of fundamental freedoms in the twenty-first century .
It would weaken the control that they currently have over it .
Next , the charter would provide a new pretext for the frenzied standardisation of citizens ' rights in Europe .
Indeed I am astounded that governments are prepared to allow this to happen .
Have they not learnt the lessons of the past ?
Here we are at the heart of what we have called the process of reducing rights .
I am referring to it as a vessel because it is obviously still only a framework .
We do not , as yet , know what we will put inside it .
We cannot change this by giving citizens a Charter of Fundamental Rights .
It should only include articles which can give a meaningful message to these European institutions .
Finally , fundamental rights are based on human dignity .
I therefore welcome it .
This question was raised in that document too .
Later on , at the Cologne Summit , Parliament ' s wider request was also honoured .
It should not duplicate what is already there .
I will probably submit a text on this matter myself .
The governments , and , on their behalf , the Council of Cologne , left the question open .
There are , so to speak , two parallel operations .
Ladies and gentlemen , human rights are a constitutional issue .
Mr President , I should like to express my substantial agreement with the point just made by Mr Napolitano .
There is however one risk .
If we do not succeed in that , we will fail in everything .
The EU is faced with a number of choices . Are we to secure our own rights ?
That would , of course , weaken the latter and damage the situation regarding human rights throughout Europe .
But does this Charter add to what we already have ?
Does this Charter simply aim to be an expensive distributor of compensation in the dreadful fullness of time ?
Mr President , why do we need such a Charter ?
Many citizens do not know the rights that exist today .
The rights need to be in two categories .
In my view , there has not to date been so much discussion on the subject .
It cannot and must not be without this reference .
For this reason , we are against it .
We are not questioning the content of such a charter .
Firstly , because it would divide us in a cause in which we should be united .
This is not a plus , but a minus .
The appropriate setting in which to enshrine fundamental rights is the constitutional law of each nation state .
This would ensure that they were clearly incorporated into the acquis communautaire .
So reads Item B in the motion for a resolution we have before us .
In our capacity as citizens , we have freedoms and rights , but we also have responsibilities .
However , the report by Duff and Voggenhuber has given us cause for this today .
I would particularly like to take this opportunity to highlight how doggedly they have pursued their goal .
With this in mind , I hope the report in question achieves an overwhelming majority in plenary tomorrow .
The Council of Europe ' s Convention is now 50 years old .
However there is one point which I would like to be amended .
I have tabled an amendment to this effect on behalf of my group .
This was an important goal in the past .
With all due respect for the Human Rights Convention , we need more !
The European Convention on Human Rights does not fulfil this task .
Let us support them in this .
We do it differently and no less effectively .
That is why the theme is tiresome to so many .
Families are firmly connected with the European notion of society .
Like many others , the Christian Democrats want a society where freedom and responsibility meet halfway .
Society may be just , but it cannot ever love .
Its bosom is too cold and its arm too short .
Social development with that end in sight still takes place in the family .
There can thus be no people ' s Europe without a family-oriented Europe .
I can show you the constitutions of post-communist states in which the family and marriage is protected .
I welcome the reference in our Charter to family life .
The Union should only step into a primary role where the family is unable to fulfil its duty .
In our opinion , this is a question of responsibility and also of consistency .
This is not the case , and that is not the purpose of all this .
This is a real problem and one of which we should all be aware .
This is a fundamental question .
The third question , and a crucial one , is the body of rights .
How far do we intend to go ?
How far is the Union prepared to go ?
On this subject , I should like to mention the issue of the Intergovernmental Conference .
Once again , the Commission would like to make four key points quite clear to Parliament .
I would also like to clearly state a second idea .
I would like to make two more observations on the list of rights .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Vitorino .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Additional Commission contribution to the IGC
This was one of them .
This is the point we have discussed today in order to complete our opinion .
These proposals concern the methods for decision making in matters of taxation and social security .
Having said that , I should like to clarify three misunderstandings which sometimes arise .
Firstly , the Commission is not demanding new jurisdiction for taxation and social security .
Ever since the Treaty of Rome , the Treaties have provided for Community action in both these areas .
Switching from unanimity to qualified majority is not a transfer of jurisdiction .
The Commission is keeping strictly to the areas of jurisdiction which are already available to the European Community .
It is only the method of decision making which may change .
This is the first point that I wished to make clear .
Let me say again , unanimity is to remain the general rule .
We confirm this approach .
This is the first principle .
That is the second principle .
Finally , my third principle , we must in future select the best instrument to respect subsidiarity .
But this selection of the best instrument must be limited to that which is strictly necessary .
We also consider it important to introduce it to the field of taxation too .
For the remainder , unanimity shall remain the general rule .
In so doing we are seeking to achieve coherence .
We must avoid penalising them .
The Commission undertook to carry out clear , proactive work .
We eliminated any ideological thinking .
That makes absolute sense .
How will that be defined ?
It sounds fine but how do you define a measure that is essential to make the single market work ?
That is a matter of intense debate .
To quote but one example : the country of origin principle in matters of VAT .
Or another example : double taxation , which causes so many problems .
Thank you very much , Commissioner , for your comments .
I do not understand your assertion that there will be no transfer of powers .
Commissioner , I should like to pick up on a point which you made in your speech .
Mr Rübig , in answering I shall focus on the matter of VAT .
Jointly with the Member States , we are currently identifying what should go into this package .
Mr President , Commissioner Barnier , I am extremely pleased that the Commission has produced this initiative .
Those who deny this call the future of the internal market into question .
Could you comment on this ?
Commissioner , you are proceeding with the utmost caution , and that is an approach which I support .
I have three specific questions that I would like to ask you :
Can you guarantee that the Commission will not use qualified majority voting on any of those issues ?
This is why I would like to direct two specific questions to the Commissioner .
Mr Leinen discussed this , as did Mr Baltas and , just now , Mrs Van Lancker .
Obviously , the Monti package is related to the proper operation of the internal market .
We wish to ensure that the Community has effective means to support this restructuring at Community level .
I am aware that my answers are necessarily incomplete given the time available .
Mr Bolkestein , Mrs Diamantopoulou and myself will have the opportunity to address you again in future .
But , in the final analysis , as we all know , what we need is the political will .
Question Time ( Commission )
The next item is Question Time ( B5-0201 / 2000 ) . We will examine questions to the Commission .
Question No 39 by ( H-0174 / 00 ) :
This definition does not in any way affect the status of Western Sahara and its coastal waters .
However , you have expressed it with extreme clarity ? .
Does the Commission commit itself to formally consulting the Secretary-General of the United Nations ?
Yes or no , Commissioner ?
That also goes , of course , for his special representative .
Question No 113 by ( H-0251 / 00 ) :
What provisions will be taken to ensure that NGOs enjoy effective access to Union funding ?
I hope you will excuse me that in answering the questions together , I take slightly longer .
I will also take this opportunity to respond to Madame Carlotti ' s question .
Anti-personnel mines create appalling casualties in many of the poorest parts of the world .
We have intervened in all corners of the world .
We have supported action by national authorities , international organisations , and not least NGOs .
Therefore they should form part of national or regional reconstruction and rehabilitation plans .
That will require determination , consistency and perseverance .
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his reply which I find extremely satisfactory .
It indicates the Commission ' s high level of commitment to this issue .
Thank you very much , Commissioner , for this comprehensive answer .
Might I ask you to clarify one point ?
One thing that we obviously need to do is to advertise very clearly what is available .
We intend establishing a multi-annual work plan .
We will refer to that on our website .
I hope , therefore , that NGOs will feel involved in what we are doing .
We depend a great deal on their active support and understanding .
They have a great deal to contribute to this important work .
Question No 41 by ( H-0212 / 00 ) :
This is completely justified given the actual purpose of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
I am pleased to hear the Commissioner 's comments on the Charter .
I would like to push him to give details about the nature of the campaign .
After all , it is the MEPs who are supposed to represent the citizens .
We are at least as well-placed as the Commission to engage in that dialogue with the citizens .
The simple answer , Mr President , is ' yes ' .
Question No 42 by ( H-0215 / 00 ) :
Mr Fischler will reply on behalf of Mrs Wallström .
I should like to thank the Commissioner for his answer .
The key issues to be addressed by this international task force have already been established .
Commissioner , thank you for your answer .
And not just these reactors , but also the reactors in Slovakia and Lithuania .
Mr Trakatellis , opinion is extremely divided as to how unsafe the reactors 3 and 4 actually are .
Now it is up to me who I believe .
So that is quite some way off the shutdown date we had mind .
Questions to Mr Lamy
Question No 44 by ( H-0206 / 00 ) :
What timetable does he propose for the implementation of this measure ?
I am also thinking , possibly , of a number of emerging countries , already industrialised .
That is the state of play at the present time .
This is the response I wished to give to this question which looks to the future .
I am grateful to Commissioner Lamy for his answer , as far as it went .
That is the sort of message we want to hear .
We do not want to wait for five years ; let others follow our example " .
There are two parts to my answer to this question .
These are matters to which we shall no doubt return .
But that is something that only we need concern ourselves with .
Question No 45 by ( H-0208 / 00 ) :
This is the legal and institutional answer to your question , Mr Clegg .
Thank you very much for that reply .
I would urge you to do so .
That is perfectly normal , I feel , and I look forward to it .
My question , however , concerns concrete matters and the substance of this agreement .
This is a good question .
I remember using this expression , contrasting 80 % and 20 % .
That still leaves 20 % , however , and for a very simple reason .
That is the first reason .
There is another , more technical reason , involving some subtle points .
Although the designations are fairly similar , there may be very different tariff items .
It is not quite over yet .
Thank you very much , Mr Lamy .
Questions to Mr Fischler
Question No 48 by ( H-0173 / 00 ) :
The Commissioner has not been explicit .
Therefore the comparison you have just drawn is inappropriate to my mind .
Secondly , these are two completely different questions .
In your question , which I answered , you asked what enlargement will cost .
Question No 49 by ( H-0187 / 00 ) :
Question No 50 by ( H-0190 / 00 ) :
What decisions have been taken to balance the financial cost of agreements with the North and South ?
What is the Commission 's assessment of the above-mentioned imbalances between these two types of agreement ?
I actually referred to this at the beginning of my answer .
You mentioned the Council .
That is why we must overcome this problem .
That is no way to solve the problem .
We must draw a distinction .
There is little point in doing that in our view .
Question No 51 by ( H-0195 / 00 ) :
Is the export aid which has been made available by the French Government compatible with Article 92 ?
If so , could such aid be extended to cover timber exports to third countries ?
Understandably , therefore , the Commission has asked the French Government for additional information .
I should like to ask the Commissioner to clarify his answer .
Obviously such aid is already officially provided for in the countries of the Community .
My question clearly concerned exports outside the common market , outside the Union .
We can only apply existing Community law in such cases .
This would be a clear distortion of the market .
In fact this proposal met with the approval of a majority of the management committee .
That being the case , it will be possible to fulfil all the contracts concluded in the Member States .
That is what the contracts concluded in Germany amounted to in total .
Question No 61 by ( H-0156 / 00 ) :
What immediate action does the Commission intend to take in order to expedite such an agreement ?
In any event , the final decision in this respect is the responsibility of the Member States .
With regard to the Trans-European Networks we cannot include anything which is not supported by the Member States .
Today , the works on the road route are already under way .
We are right , therefore , to ask questions about the future .
There is no doubt that crossing the great mountain ranges of the European Union is a problem .
However , the concrete solutions must clearly be accepted by the Member States .
It is clearly the countries of the Iberian peninsular which have the greatest interest here .
Question No 62 by ( H-0163 / 00 ) :
The EU is at present adopting legislation to promote mobility and road safety .
I should also like to put a following question to the Commissioner .
Most countries apply a level of 0.5 mg .
We consider that legislation should be reserved for cases where it is absolutely necessary to legislate .
This is an important issue that is often left out when we are talking about driving .
Will this ever be put into the recommendation ?
The problem is obviously that drugs produce states which clearly limit drivers ' response capacities .
Question No 63 by ( H-0164 / 00 ) :
It appears that the Commission favours the Brenner base tunnel project .
Has the Commission studied the potential environmental impact of the various projects for a Verona-Munich rail link ?
Can the Commission finance a further study of the question of the transport of goods via the Brenner ?
In principle , it largely follows the route of the current conventional line .
All we need is a ban on transiting heavy goods traffic .
The truth is that there is currently no such alternative .
Therefore , the first thing we have to do is suitably develop the corresponding routes .
Of course , all of this is linked to our society and its development .
This is all about people living in a sensitive area who must be protected .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
That concludes Questions to the Commission .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.25 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
The European eco-label is , it has to be said , a product of the internal market .
And this is of major importance when it comes to the daily shopping trip .
However , it is often a long road from the conception of a good idea to its practical implementation .
I think that a key problem lies in the cost structure of the label .
In this regard , I should cite , for example , EMAS and ISO 14001 .
In addition to a reduction in costs for certain enterprises , the report also envisages a maximum fee .
In my opinion , we should take on the responsibility for this financing .
In some States national labels are well established and enjoy public recognition .
Our approach should be different .
Both groups , however , have one thing in common : they want the eco-label to succeed .
If we can achieve this , then we will have globalised an important environmental principle .
It would have afforded the opportunity to disseminate the European label even more quickly and effectively .
An important issue is the involvement of non-governmental organisations and associations .
The aim of our amendments is to increase the participation of associations .
If you would allow me to make a point of order ...
It is therefore especially important that the idea of prohibiting national eco-labels has been abandoned .
I also believe it is important to realise that there is nothing to prevent the existence of parallel eco-labels .
Our experience shows that the labels would , in that way , be given greater credibility .
Moreover , this system functions excellently where it has been introduced .
I also think it is good that the idea of a graded eco-label has been done away with .
It is easier just to have the picture of a flower .
We are also pleased that the proposal is to cover the service sector , too .
The eco-label should not be associated with mediocrity .
Services such as tourism and clean taxes could register .
In addition , groups of similar small business could possibly cooperate and register together .
The proposal also reinforces the interested parties ' role and participation .
We are therefore able to accept these amendments .
We are therefore able to approve these amendments , too .
The Commission supports this overarching objective .
The Commission is able to support this amendment , too .
To summarise , the Commission is therefore able to approve all the amendments .
They are only to be found in English .
This applies , for example , to Amendments 7 and 8 .
These are only available in English , which is totally unacceptable .
That was the first point .
The second concerns , for example , the work programme for environmental strategy ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Thank you very much for pointing out the position regarding amendments .
The services are looking at this and I hope that they will be ready in time for tomorrow .
We cannot allow the debate to continue because we are running out of time .
Thank you , Commissioner , for your contribution .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Incineration of waste
I should like to say that I think this is completely unacceptable .
They have had more than 12 hours in which to correct the amendments concerned .
Thank you very much for pointing that out .
We will try and make sure it is corrected by tomorrow .
This is illustrated by the compromise we reached on the scope of the directive .
This process will obviously need to be closely monitored for emissions of dangerous substances .
Compliance requires adequate control which , in turn , requires proper monitoring .
Mr Florenz was among those who were right to point out that clear measuring regulations are vital .
The Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection has asked for ammonia levels to be measured .
It is wrong , however , that the standards for ammonia should not apply to all installations .
As far as the continuous sampling of dioxins is concerned , this appears to be quite feasible .
A cumulative sample is taken for a one-month period .
At first reading , considerable improvements were made to the Commission proposal thanks to a great deal of support .
It was at that stage that expectations were raised amongst the citizens .
I strongly urge MEPs to meet these expectations .
One might well ask what was the point of combining these two matters .
What is the advantage of this for the environment ?
This is what the common position proposes .
As regards dioxins and furanes , the limit values have now been made mandatory for all types of waste .
Until now , they applied only to non-dangerous waste .
If one wishes to go too far , one becomes counter-productive .
What the industry needs is legal certainty and reasonable time periods .
Commissioner , waste management in Europe must undergo complete reform as a matter of urgency .
Mr President , I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Blokland on this report .
Moreover , there are also some good resources which are being put to use .
Mr President , Mr Blokland has carried out an enormous task .
This subject is incredibly involved .
Moreover , the lobbyists have been something else .
I should never have believed that there were so many of them concerned about waste in Europe .
You might have thought it was gold rather than waste they were talking about .
This is a common commitment and a common responsibility .
It clearly ought , too , to be regulated at European Union level .
We must look at the whole hierarchy .
This Parliament must protect the health and quality of life of the people that we represent .
It has a habit of reappearing , often in a more harmful form .
These installations are not being brought up to date .
This issue , however , should form an exception .
We should treat this seriously .
Above all we want to save fossil fuels .
I do believe that Mr Blokland has produced the wrong report at the wrong time for the wrong reasons .
We cannot say that it is all wrong .
Indeed there are many sensible proposals put forward in areas where the technology makes it possible to advance .
We have to expect that it will take time to implement this report .
Mr Blokland has also exceeded in many ways the brief he was given .
Unfortunately , this is going to give environment policy a bad name .
We should not be constantly re-regulating incinerators .
We should be seeking ways to avoid incineration in the first place .
If we do not , we will very soon find ourselves back with this problem again .
Mr President , I certainly agree with Mr Bowe 's final summary .
Will his position remain the same when he is debating the packaging directive ?
It will be interesting to see if he sticks to his principles there .
We also must remember that waste does not disappear .
It is turned into dioxins and also toxic ash - what will you do with that ?
In Ireland , some operators are proposing using it in building materials .
What will be the long-term consequences of that ?
We have one of the highest landfill records in Europe .
For any government to propose that incineration should be introduced instead of landfill is completely misguided .
We have to look at the root causes of why the waste is there in the first place .
Thus , we do not incinerate mixed waste , as they do in certain countries .
The incineration of mixed waste is bad environmental policy .
Sorted waste can be incinerated effectively together with other fuels in a so-called coincineration process .
For that reason , Amendments Nos 14 , 17 , 18 and 27 should not be adopted .
Have they received any representations from United Kingdom ministers ?
I have given the Commissioner notice of these questions .
I am mainly worried about the so-called coincineration of waste .
There are many amendments in the report that are problematic .
The directive makes some headway in that direction .
This should not be happening .
Mrs Paulsen , was right : this is exactly where compliance with the principle of subsidiarity is needed .
Another example is the call for the ongoing monitoring of the ammonia content of gas from chimneys .
Mr President , Mr Blokland , ladies and gentlemen , waste management is a complex task .
This is confirmed yet again by our discussions and the particularly powerful lobbying .
The majority decided in favour of coincineration .
The volume of waste to be incinerated is going to be significantly increased .
The debate has focused on coincineration .
And this is important and necessary .
In my opinion , we should not disregard these efforts ....
( The President cut the speaker off )
The first is the impact of this directive on the existing specialist toxic waste incineration industry .
These incinerators have to adhere to higher standards than the coincineration plants .
We need the specialist toxic waste incinerators .
There are only three at the moment in the United Kingdom .
The second point I would make is to underline the point made by Dr Jackson .
I come from a region in the United Kingdom with the highest density of pigs .
I should like to remind you that there already exists a directive on a waste hierarchy .
43 amendments have been tabled .
The following amendments are aimed at clarifying the Commission ' s proposal .
The Commission is not able to approve the first section of Amendment No 14 .
The second section of this amendment is , in principle , acceptable .
By introducing an explanation of the word " untreated " , the paragraph can be made less ambiguous .
The amendments would involve the provisions in these acts being duplicated or becoming more ambiguous .
This amendment cannot , however , be adopted by the Commission .
The Commission therefore considers that Amendments Nos 20 and 21 are unnecessary .
Amendments Nos 36-39 are designed to tighten up the requirements with regard to measurements .
This is also justified from the point of view of cost-income analysis .
We consequently accept this principle .
Nor does it sound as if one should be burning them at home in one ' s backyard .
I am looking at Article 2 ( 2 ) and I cannot see that exclusion set out there .
It talks about vegetable waste and vegetable waste does not cover dead animals .
However , I will get clarification from the Commissioner personally .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon .
Ozone in ambient air
It is a good target and , if it is at all possible , then it should be retained .
But equally it would be wrong for us to water down the draft directive .
I think we have put forward a reasonable compromise here .
We hope that you will consent to it .
Mr President , I should first of all like to thank Mr Chris Davies for this report .
I think there are two crucial points here .
The first is that the WHO ' s guidelines should be adhered to .
I think that setting dates is very important to our also in actual fact attaining the objectives .
I think they are completely incomprehensible and irresponsible .
I would also like to thank the European Commission for its sound green proposals .
Back in July 1995 , Strasbourg was labouring under ozone smog .
The European Commission ' s proposal has made a lot of headway in this direction .
Ozone smog is still on the increase .
It is now even permeating the southern European skies during the winter months .
Ozone smog is now to be found everywhere in Europe .
Ozone is always an aggressive substance .
My group can also support the twenty exceedances proposed by the Committee .
This is the topic of Mrs Myller ' s report .
In the case of an ozone alert , we also need to be able to take short-term action .
The Dutch Government makes so many concessions to the transport lobby that it fails to realise this .
For my group , the car is no sacred cow .
It is an extremely important report , especially from a health perspective .
This especially applies to the situation in southern Europe .
It is true that climates with long periods of high pressure increase the presence of ozone .
The reasons have to be sought in traffic levels , in industrial processes and in energy production .
It is also these matters which we can influence by means of the Directives concerned .
We know that exceedance of ozone limits directly affects children ' s lung capacity .
Nonetheless , ozone still constitutes one of the most serious environmental problems .
Attaining the World Health Organisation ' s target values is only the first step .
We cannot , however , accept that short-term measures should only be taken at local level .
The Commission is able to approve the principles behind Amendments 10 and 11 .
Amendment No 12 can be approved in principle .
The principle in Amendment No 16 is also acceptable .
The Commission agrees that climate changes ought to be emphasised .
Amendment No 2 advocates coordination between Member States and Applicant States .
We cannot , however , approve Amendment No 1 .
In addition , the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 28 .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will be taken at 12 noon tomorrow .
The legacy of past decades is going to take some time to put right , however .
We are still not even aware of all the technical potential for ridding ourselves of sources of emissions entirely .
For this reason , it is reasonable to proceed in stages , as the Commission has proposed .
In place of ' reached ' it should say ' exceeded ' .
I hope that this will be sorted out before tomorrow ' s vote .
There is a clear difference between this proposal and the Commission ' s .
Why did the Commission come up with these even stricter and substantially more expensive ceilings only one month later ?
These are the amendments passed by the industry committee .
Support the Purvis amendments and the United Nations Gothenburg table of national emission ceilings .
Research into the question has been going on for 30 years .
The impossibility lies , therefore , not in the directive but in the current situation .
Others have not even used the same methodology , the same basis of calculation as others .
So the protocol in many ways is a nonsense .
It can give us no confidence whatsoever .
It is a messy political compromise and nothing more .
We should support this report and give her our backing .
We want to emphasise that an integrated strategy must be adopted to reduce emissions .
This model is sound and the results are well founded .
The Commission itself says that the proposal can be implemented cost effectively .
In my opinion this is not ambitious ; if anything , the opposite .
This cannot happen within the context of collective environmental responsibility .
The vast majority of the amendments I can support .
With what targets are we to start ?
It seems to me that the Commission figures are aspirational .
Mr President , Commissioner , I have , of course , nothing against the principle of the directive .
It is an important instrument for future environmental policy .
The Member States are given a clearer brief .
They know what they should be aiming for .
That is because a large country can use its better regions to offset its bad practices .
A small country is not in a position to do this .
I shall give you an example .
One per cent of the GDP per annum is too much of a strain for my country .
Acidified water also releases heavy metals which constitute a health problem .
We are , for the most part , complying with the emission targets proposed in the now current directive .
We are therefore appealing for your help .
We ought therefore to have a common interest in applauding the present EU draft directive .
Previously , atmospheric pollution used to be associated with roads and traffic .
In short , it means our whole ecosystem , and action must be taken .
Furthermore , it estimates the costs for each Member State of complying with these limits .
I think that this is a good strategy .
All of this seems quite reasonable .
Nevertheless , I must ask a question here .
Would this not be wise ?
Air quality in Europe has improved considerably in recent years .
These two goals are not , in my opinion , mutually exclusive .
The Gothenburg Protocol is a step forward .
However , it is nowhere near enough .
A substantial number of people will die early if we do not adopt the measures proposed by the Commission .
We cannot let this deflect the Community from agreed goals .
They amount to only 0.08 % of Community GDP in the year 2010 .
Let me now turn to the amendments .
The Commission can accept fully Amendments Nos 3 , 8 , 9 , 13 , 19 and 21 .
The Commission can accept in part the principle underlying Amendments Nos 1 and 2 .
It follows that the Commission does not accept Amendment No 27 .
The Commission can also accept in part Amendment No 11 which would make further changes to Article 9 .
We accept in part the principles underlying Amendment No 12 .
The Commission accepts the principles of Amendment No 23 .
The Commission has a great deal of sympathy with the concerns underlying Amendments Nos 16 and 17 .
We do not accept the remainder of Amendment No 20 .
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 15 , 28 , 29 and 32 .
Gothenburg ceilings fall far short of what is needed as has already been said .
We cannot therefore accept Amendment No 31 .
Amendments Nos 5 , 18 and 30 are also unacceptable .
The Commission must reject Amendment No 6 .
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 7 .
The proposed definition is identical in the Gothenburg Protocol .
We must maintain technical consistency .
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 10 .
It would remove an essential obligation for Member States regularly to update emission inventories .
Finally , Mr President , we do not accept Amendment No 22 .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
That is something which the committee as a whole is keen to see .
I want to quote from an article in the United Kingdom Sunday Telegraph this last Sunday .
That is a question which my German colleagues who are moving the other question want to follow up .
The question is : is this a constitutionally viable way of doing that ?
What we are exploring here tonight in this crowded House is the question of linkage .
I would not want to change or spare anything in achieving this .
To date , the Commission has only threatened sanctions in the case of the FFH directive .
Does it also intend to initiate sanction mechanisms in the other areas ?
In my opinion , this is a very problematic course of action .
I would ask that we make this point absolutely clear here .
Our question to you , Commissioner , has another purpose .
We are discussing something here of which most know the history .
Many Member States , including my own , did not do as required .
But what does it matter ? !
As a result , the European Union list is obviously not ready .
And how could it be ?
Many Member States and many regions have not announced their sites .
It must be observed !
You must do it !
If you think the legislation is no good , let us revise it .
I wish her well .
If that is the case then it is good news indeed .
In fact , it is a position in which I too find myself to some extent .
Some simple questions : how long is the Commissioner prepared to perform this balancing act ?
Just how much must Member States do to meet her requirements ?
That is the balance I suppose .
Let me make one thing clear first to avoid misunderstandings .
The Structural Funds Regulation has been approved by the Member States and the Council .
One more word on the habitats directive .
The Commission does not agree that there is a lack of clarity in this directive .
They are seriously late .
They have completely failed to meet the requirements of the European directives .
I am not suggesting that we contravene legislation .
I consider that to be a disproportionate action for what we are trying to achieve .
But let us be clear .
We therefore need to have a balanced relationship between means and ends .
That is your responsibility as a member of the college .
It should not just be an idle threat .
You should carry it out if Member States do not act responsibly .
We are , per capita , the worst country as regards complaints .
If this affects my own country , then so be it .
Member States have to comply with European regulations .
You must stick to that .
If Member States are not willing to comply with the directives , cut off the funding .
I would support you one hundred percent .
Sustainable development is supposed to be about integrating economic development with environmental concerns .
At the heart of this debate is the issue of economic development coming right up against environmental constraints .
We are going to be increasingly faced with hard decisions on this .
It will be a very good test of what our commitment to sustainable development really means .
At a recent plenary session , we talked a lot about coherence in EU policies .
That is why the Greens are supporting very strongly this resolution from the Environment Committee .
That was not at all clear .
Let me say two or three things .
Firstly , I think that Community law must be seen as a whole .
You should do that !
Secondly , Commissioner , the Structural Funds are not given out to damage the countryside .
They are given out to create jobs and to kick-start the regions .
None of us want anything for the environment to be left undone .
Here too we must watch out !
Twelve European countries are before the European Court .
Constitutional challenge is often quoted in Ireland as one of our reasons .
Perhaps you will take those on board in items 2 and 3 of the motion .
The process brought the following problems to light in particular .
Without any doubt , this cannot be in the interests of the Commission .
It would be sensible to re-examine and revise Directive 9243 to provide more certainty and clarity .
Citizens have the right to know the consequences which they can expect .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make a few final comments .
This is not about the implementation of the habitats directive .
Remember that the directive is not an effort directive , it is a result directive .
That is what this is about .
It is the obligation of the Commission to ensure that these sites are protected .
So does this mean that we will not approve the operational programmes to answer your question ?
We are reasonable .
That is a clear timetable .
That is the decision we have taken today .
This will be a very important tool .
That is what we have to hope for and maybe pray for too .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon .
( The sitting was closed at 12.09 a.m. )
Mrs Maes has the floor for a point of order .
Maes ( Verts / ALE ) .
We would like to know how the presidency has dealt with this correspondence .
50th anniversary of the Geneva Convention - humanitarian law
Amongst these organisations , we should highlight the International Committee of the Red Cross .
We have failed to spread the lessons and values learned from that conflict .
We have failed to educate against the glorification of combat in our own communities .
We need to be working hard to combat racism and xenophobia .
Mr President , I am in sincere agreement with what was said in the previous speech .
Over the last century , these have totally changed in nature .
Today we are hearing the case of Albin Kurti , of Kosovo .
The Geneva Conventions are a vital part of this minimum level of action .
Personally , I cannot see any reason why the European Parliament should be thanking Russia .
We recently witnessed a huge humanitarian disaster brought about by a supposedly humanitarian intervention .
Nearly 50 % of infants born prematurely die .
The children being born are underdeveloped due to malnutrition .
There has been a dramatic increase in the number of abortions .
Article 1 ( b ) of the relevant Convention forbids the taking of hostages .
Millions of people are suffering worldwide .
But let us think just of a few people in order to bring home the horror and suffering .
Iraq is a formidable enemy .
After nine years she has only provided information sufficient to close three files .
Do not lift economic sanctions while their fate remains uncertain .
This , I deeply regret .
The situation in Serbia is becoming more and more absurd .
This was considered helping the UCK !
Surely this is too absurd for words !
Meanwhile , the population remains very concerned about the fate of those in prison .
There are reports of torture .
They include the right to personal and political freedom and basic social and economic rights .
There is a vicious circle .
Trampling over human rights today paves the way for conflict tomorrow .
Human rights are indivisible .
It must prove itself to be a community of values .
But more responsible human rights policies need to start at home .
However we must also take action to ensure that there are fewer victims in the future .
However welcome some of these developments may be , more needs to be done .
In my view , there are at present two main problems connected with the Geneva Conventions .
This is especially the case if it is a question of internal conflicts .
I believe we have two options which are not mutually exclusive .
This demand has also been put forward here today .
Thank you very much , Mr Nielson .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday .
Human rights , racism , xenophobia and antisemitism
The next item is the joint debate on :
Unfortunately , these hopes have , in many respects , been dashed .
The European Community was formed in order to prevent the atrocities of the Second World War from occurring again .
Both internal work and foreign policy rest on this principle .
This work has become even more important as time has gone by .
No one can fail to appreciate the commitment found , for example , in this House .
The EU is therefore in desperate need of a coordinated , strategic and consistent policy in this area .
We need a consistent policy that is credible and predictable .
There must be no doubt about what the EU stands for .
Certain basic rights are universal .
Violations of these can therefore never be excused on grounds of religion , culture or tradition .
We could also form an advisory group containing representatives from the different EU institutions .
There ought to be experts in the EU 's delegations in third countries .
The web site could also contain links to different organisations .
The Commission declared 1999 to be the year for combating violence against women .
It was a praiseworthy initiative , but the campaign was discreet to say the least .
We need long-term work , not occasional campaigns .
Women 's rights are being systematically violated throughout the world .
This can now be a matter for examination in the International Criminal Court .
Rape is at present the world 's most common crime of violence .
The trade in women and children is increasing at an alarming rate .
In certain countries , the governments are employing a pure apartheid policy against women .
Thousands of young women suffer genital mutilation every day .
Obviously we need to deal with this .
They should be clear and comprehensible and not consist of idle talk .
The EU should not be changing or reinventing things .
The aforesaid legal practice is not static .
Fortunately , it is developing the whole time .
The conventions too are constantly being supplemented .
But so too must the present Member States .
The demands we impose upon others we must also impose upon ourselves .
We must say to all fifteen governments : go home and get the conventions signed and ratified .
Technology is developing and so too , therefore , must our instruments for the protection of human rights .
Some may find the language in my report blunt and it is certainly intended to be clear and unambiguous .
I believe this report will get majority support here in plenary .
Meanwhile , the day-to-day reality is disappointing .
Racism , xenophobia and antisemitism are realities in Eastern and Western Europe alike .
However , this situation should not lead to debilitating mutual recriminations or imputations .
Quite the opposite , in fact : a common social threat requires a common , political effort .
This kind of attention also requires us to look into our own hearts .
Mrs Ludford ' s report bears witness to this .
This is the Roma issue with all its intricacies in a nutshell .
How can they be galvanised into social involvement and into achieving the much-needed change in mentality ?
Indeed , antisemitism does not appear to bear any relevance to the numerical presence of Jews .
In this light , Jews and Hungarians are seen as traitors of the mother country in Romania .
Paragraph 32 of the draft resolution should be read against this dark background .
Mainly to avoid duplication , I will only partly support the newly tabled amendments .
All in all , the present report requires , in my opinion , regular follow-ups or continuous re-assessment .
It would mean a great deal to me if this were to be accomplished .
In Slovakia , the Czech Republic and Hungary there were significant problems with the treatment of the Roma .
I would make two or three other very simple points .
There are many questions we must discuss : How strongly will we push the question of Article 13 ?
Do we really want race discrimination protection throughout the European Union ?
The answer is yes .
We must have it quickly and we must have comprehensive legislation .
It is representation and other similar issues that we must now tackle .
Racism is a complex issue .
We have begun to discuss it adequately but we have so much further to go .
I also back the rapporteur ' s decision to deal extensively with the women ' s rights issue .
Millions of women throughout the world are still being circumcised or married off .
We must condemn all practices which lead to the mutilation or death of women .
Within the European Union , female circumcision must be made a punishable offence .
Domestic violence is still a huge problem within the European Union .
We must take a firm stance against this , which also involves prosecution .
A business which is estimated by the UNDP to be worth USD 7 billion .
Mr President , this report sends a powerful message to the Council and Commission .
In any case , we will judge them on their actions , not their words .
I am also very pleased that Mr Haarder took up the rights of minority groups .
The Commission needs this aid .
We ought also to give aid when it comes to allocating budget funds to work for children 's rights .
Without civil society we are living in a vacuum .
We cannot breathe unless we are motivated from outside , from grassroots level .
The report contains a number of excellent and well-considered proposals .
This is a precision weapon , which must be utilised more .
It must be a dynamic one and one that can penetrate the reality of the situation at all levels .
We cannot go about correcting obvious wrongdoings by merely resorting to rhetorical commitment .
Racism and antisemitism are on the increase in the European Union and beyond .
Our first act must therefore be not only to refuse to accept this situation but to publicly denounce it .
Due to its clear-sightedness , Mrs Ludford ' s report actively contributes to this approach .
It is a crime against human dignity . It is antisocial behaviour which can include physical attacks on individuals .
On each occasion , people were given the ideological arms to carry out the attacks .
There is also another type of racism which involves daily harassment and humiliation .
You can guess which ' applicant ' was invited for interview .
Throughout its history Europe has been capable of the best and the worst .
We must teach our children about all of this .
These people have clearly chosen their side .
All these fine words must now lead to concrete action and practical legislative steps .
Legislation against racism must be harmonised . The words must take on real meaning .
For example , the right to immigration does not exist .
Moreover , the idea of completely uncontrolled immigration is unimaginable , if only for reasons of space and numbers .
And , in addition , there are duties which should sometimes be remembered as well as rights .
For example , we have been talking about the Roma .
Many of them abuse their women and , more importantly , their children .
And where does the right to life come in ?
And what about the protection of the family ?
Racism , xenophobia and antisemitism must be stamped out .
I fully share this view , which is expressed in the Ludford report .
This notion smacks of a naïve kind of intellectualism .
( Applause from the right )
We have several basic principles .
Children are actually invisible in the EU Treaties .
Animals have rights , children do not .
Yet children are affected by the laws that the EU passes and the single market .
We have problems in the candidate countries .
We have a scandal at the moment in Latvia which allegedly goes to the very heart of the government .
And of course , we have familiar tales of child labour .
We have to take tougher action .
We have to bring children up the agenda .
We should ensure that measures developed by the Commission have a specific children 's dimension .
Why can we not do the same ?
Why can we not do the same ?
Can we make sure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights has a section relating to children ?
I know we have communications .
Science , technology and communication have broadened man ' s knowledge and expertise and abilities beyond belief .
We should therefore concentrate all our efforts on these human rights .
But cultural value patterns underlie these violations too .
European foreign policy is too easily thrown off course by purely economic interests .
Yet our greatest failings in human rights involve these very people .
I can give you two examples of this .
The Union has confirmed its attachment to the Geneva and Dublin Conventions by establishing the anti-deportation principle .
Another flagrant attack on human rights concerns foreigners and citizenship .
This really is a case of fundamental rights .
How can we allow some people to be excluded ?
How can they believe in the reality of the Declaration of Human Rights ?
Mr President , this debate is taking place at an important moment for this Parliament .
This year is especially significant .
We have seen the mayor of that city receive 75 % support in the elections there .
To this end , we in the European Union could develop a more constructive attitude .
I want to make three small points .
The second point is an extension of yesterday ' s debate .
The result of an EU Charter would be an endlessly complicated morass of legal and constitutional problems .
Which is the decision-making authority ?
Is the latter , again , better than the national constitutions ?
That is a question which has no meaning .
Finally , my third remark is a compliment to the rapporteur , Mr Haarder .
I want to congratulate Mr Haarder on the new political insight on his part which is evidenced here .
A few weeks ago , taxi drivers in Brussels were refusing to take Austrian passengers .
Austrians were thrown out of hotels and restaurants in Belgium and France .
Perhaps we shall soon see Mozart banned from international opera houses .
Who knows where it will all end .
On the contrary , xenophobia is more likely to be caused by a decline in religious convictions .
Religion per se is a factor which promotes fraternity .
Culture is based on values , not colour .
It seems to me to be a very comprehensive report and to make some very striking points .
At this event , water will be treated as a rare economic commodity .
The second point that I would like to mention today , very briefly , is the situation in Angola .
I refer , Mr President , to point 38 and points 41 and 42 of the Haarder report .
We have to admit , however , that we still have a lot of homework to do .
Self-criticism is not enough .
It does us credit , but alone it does not suffice .
The same applies to the way in which many refugees are treated in many Member States .
In this sense , thank you .
The institutions of the Community and Member States must lead the way in this .
Shame on us for ignoring Mozambique for so long and doing too little , too late .
Shame on us for allowing the children of Iraq to die at the rate of 5 000 a month .
Half a million have died since the introduction of sanctions .
There continues to be a barbarous war in Iraq .
Bombing continues ruthlessly and unreported .
It is a war against children and the innocent citizens of that country .
Shame on us for allowing the sale of arms and weapons to the Great Lakes region .
It is something we have a great responsibility to do something about .
We are not doing anything whatsoever about it .
The citizens of this Union are our judges and juries .
I want to say to my government that we must do the same at home in Ireland .
Man could be seen as being created in the image of God .
I condemn such a conservative ideology .
It is only logical that we should observe these values .
They do not always turn out to be to our advantage .
People have to overcome their fears and short-term interests .
The Belder report contains a few concrete pointers in this respect .
My Group did not have any reason to table any more amendments .
I have no problem at all with providing them with government jobs .
What interest would be served in doing so ?
These ladies and gentlemen are never present in committee .
They never take part in detailed discussions of the problems .
Why then do we always have these proposed amendments in plenary ?
The answer is in their speeches , which we have already had the pleasure of here today .
Technical work , no thank you .
Simplified rabble-rousing , yes please .
That is the political strategy of the extreme right in this House .
This is important , because only those who are critical of themselves have the right to criticise others .
The annual debate on these matters paves the way for the basic political orientation of the European Union .
I just wonder what that has to do with human rights .
( Applause )
Mr President , although we are moving in the right direction , not everything in the garden is rosy .
I have identified three particularly characteristic points .
Finally , it is suggested that we give homosexual couples the same rights as families .
This talk is intellectually invalid because the terms used are not even defined .
What are racism , xenophobia , nationalism and extremism ?
What do these concepts cover ?
What are their philosophical origins ?
What doctrines do they involve ?
Do those accused of these acts deserve this opprobrium ?
This is completely absurd .
Racism is the desire to achieve the domination of one race over another .
Who is racist in Europe nowadays ?
Xenophobia is the rejection of a foreign presence .
Yet the problem with this supposed antiracism is not its search for truth or even its support for migrants ...
The religion of antiracism has its dogmas , its priests , its inquisitors and its witch-hunts .
History will roundly condemn the protagonists of this shameful ideology which we are proud to fight at any time .
The plane was surrounded by police guards and he was told not to step off the plane .
Neither represent any conceivable threat to the Italian State .
There is much talk of a Charter of Fundamental Rights .
The rights under the Treaty are not conditional in my view .
I therefore commend paragraphs 41 and 42 to this House .
That is what it says in the Treaties and that is what we keep reminding each other of .
Fortunately , we can show our disagreement by drumming our fingers on our tables .
As far as the content of the report is concerned , I would like to outline a few topics .
To ask the question is to answer it .
As is evident from the amendments , the battle is not over yet , not by a long shot .
My Group , on the other hand , considers the principle of equality sacrosanct .
After all , human rights are there for everybody .
I should also , however , like to thank Mr Pirker and Mrs Palacio .
I should like to express my gratitude for the broad agreement we have obtained in connection with this report .
There are ten words missing from the Danish version .
If he reads the English version , he will be able to see what the wording should be .
Mr President , in the present report China has been subjected to criticism .
In actual fact , of course , we do need to discuss human rights with China .
Then the Chinese will have to discuss and not just protest .
Its attitude towards the Turkish regime is a blatant example .
He deserves it .
That is certainly what we , on this side of the House , believe .
That is what this report aims to do .
But the EPP it seems , and others opposite , clearly do not want that .
We heard a few moments ago a disgraceful speech from Mr Gollnisch on behalf of his party .
The EPP 's amendments seek to divide families .
They object to family unity .
Their Amendment No 12 seeks to delete reference to the need for family unity in Europe .
That is the aim of Amendment No 13 . It deletes that from the report .
They do not accept that everyone has a part to play in the electoral process .
Is that what we want ?
I do not think it is .
We , on this side of the House , reject that position completely .
We will publicise the EPP position and their amendments whether they are passed or not .
We deplore the line that Mr Hernandez Mollar and his colleague have put forward .
The EPP amendments weaken the report and would make the position of this Parliament worse than at the moment .
It would make it so weak that it would be one that we could not support .
It would be a retrograde step .
I agree with Mr Schulz .
Thirdly , reference has been made to quotas .
Nowhere in this report are quotas mentioned .
As a liberal I am opposed to quotas .
This report is the annual debate on racism in the year 2000 .
It refers to where we are now .
I welcome the remarks of Mr Oostlander , and I welcome his support for the report .
People within their own communities therefore suffer .
A heartfelt thank you to the rapporteurs for their work .
More and more , we need to follow our words with actions .
Even in this Parliament , fascist and xenophobic opinions are expressed .
We must start with ourselves if we want to build a world where everyone helps each other .
Europe is full of Haiders .
And this does not mean that I do not condemn the unlawful behaviour of many Roma and other immigrants .
This is already happening .
The condemned sometimes await their execution for many years in American prisons .
This concerns Amendments Nos 17 , 16 and 19 in particular .
Thank you , Mr Lannoye . This is totally clear .
After the vote :
( The President declared the common position approved ( as amended ) )
( The President declared the common position approved ( as amended ) )
( The President declared the common position approved ( as amended ) )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Madam President , I would like to point out a mistake in translation in Amendments Nos 18 and 30 .
We can therefore point these out at the appropriate moment .
Before the vote on Amendment No 18
Thank you . Everyone is now clear on this .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
I would be most grateful if we do that right now .
I feel that we should not spend any more time on this .
I will therefore put this to the House .
We do not therefore wish to take part in this vote which we regard as partisan .
Ladies and gentlemen , we must think about this carefully .
I said that we would end at 1.15 p.m. and we have respected this timetable .
We should keep to what was decided .
Madam President , I disagree with this decision .
( The President put the proposal to the House which decided to end voting time )
Madam President , I did not want to interrupt the voting when I arrived a little bit late .
Could we request that the bells be rung a little bit earlier ?
Absolutely , Mrs Banotti .
We will make a note of this .
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Recommendation for second reading of the Lannoye report ( A5-0047 / 2000 )
However , these amendments were not adopted , unfortunately .
As a consequence , we remain concerned about the third-world cocoa producers .
From now on , chocolate is no longer a product which consists of nothing but cocoa butter .
( The President cut the speaker off )
We have not granted them this labelling on chocolate .
We have rightly refused to allow GMOs in chocolate , but only by three votes .
The question to be asked is who really benefits from the manipulation and ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Developing countries are also the victors .
This legislation takes account of the needs of the world 's poorest farmers .
Some governments have got their Snickers in a twist trying to protect their chocolate industries .
For them , however , Crunchie time has come and they now have Creme Egg on their faces .
It is high time the European Parliament gave two Cadbury 's Fingers to the chocolate snobs .
- It is now sixteen years since the debate on chocolate started in the European Parliament .
I believe that we should not even have become involved in this directive .
National chauvinism has been all too often evident in the chocolate debate .
I am therefore not happy about this .
Next I will sketch the broad outlines of this issue .
We must demand the following :
very explicit wording intended for consumers so that they can buy chocolate in full knowledge of the facts ;
the reservation of the name ' quality chocolate ' for products which contain cocoa butter ;
a study into the impact of such a measure on the export of cocoa by developing countries .
I support these demands which are contained in the amendments tabled by the rapporteur .
I myself am a consumer who is concerned about the quality and taste of traditional chocolate .
This is all cock-eyed .
Stop playing with our food .
Now that would be real progress .
Who would have believed it ?
Everyone has different tastes .
Consumers require clear and specific information .
They should no longer be deceived .
- ( DA ) The basis for prosperity in the EU is competition .
But this is not a question of health or environmental protection .
Seen from the consumers ' point of view , it is exclusively a question of taste .
It cannot therefore be right for politicians to decide what consumers should be entitled to choose between .
We can hardly do otherwise .
Consumers should find out for themselves what tastes best .
They expect major political ambition from Europe , not punctilious regulations of secondary importance .
Has such a long process at least resulted in a practical text ?
The answer is clearly no .
The new directive does not meet any of the relevant needs .
To take account of the food customs of certain northern countries , derogations were specified .
The situation was therefore satisfactory .
So why change it ?
Might the rest of the acquis communautaire no longer be untouchable ?
Cocoa butter represents 8 to 9 % of the total price of chocolate .
Not at all .
In fact , quite the contrary .
As usual , harmonisation is occurring at the lowest common denominator .
Will the new text at least allow the consumer to easily distinguish between true and imitation chocolate ?
The Commission is therefore setting a percentage which it knows is unverifiable .
This is deceitful .
The text also contains dishonest provisions in terms of labelling .
Chocolate lovers , religiously savour your next Easter eggs !
What will be next after chocolate ?
When labelling comes in the door , sense flies out the window ...
This is a distinctive label used throughout Europe which we want to imbue with renewed vigour .
However , we must not cast aside all the national logos .
You could almost imagine yourself faced with a bar of chocolate !
This House should challenge other Member States to match Britain 's example .
It means protecting the natural environment on the ground too .
Again , Britain 's Labour Government is leading the way .
Our citizens want to see concrete action .
They do not want to see mere hot air from politicians , which just adds to global warming .
By harnessing Euro-Flower power , we can all contribute to a cleaner , greener world .
Recommendation for second reading of the Blokland report ( A5-0056 / 2000 )
Waste management is a very complex issue subject to extensive lobbying .
I therefore raised my concerns and questions at first reading .
Regrettably , in my opinion , a majority has approved co-incineration .
The debate has particularly crystallised around co-incineration plants .
This directive also seeks to control the discharge of waste into our water systems .
This report is now before us at second reading .
I believe that this is a particularly sensible proposal .
There is a growing concern about the environmental consequences of landfill sites in general .
These targets , which are to be achieved over the next fifteen years , include the following : -
· A diversion of 50 % of overall household waste from landfill sites .
· A minimum 65 % reduction in bio-degradable waste presently consigned for landfill sites .
7 . Makes continuous sampling of dioxins a compulsory requirement in incineration and co-incineration processes .
8 . Increases the role of the public in decision making on the siting of installations .
9 . Makes it compulsory to publish an annual environmental report on compliance with limit values .
10 . Considerably limits the present derogations for cement kilns .
The majority of the Member States currently have limit values of 50 mg / m3 .
Plants for unsorted waste require more advanced equipment .
With regard to municipal waste , I have several comments to make .
Incineration is often the most effective and safe method of waste disposal .
The technology for cleaning up fumes from waste incineration plants already exists .
We just need to make sure that it is used .
The sensible measures put forward by the Commission should encourage the utilisation of this technology .
I find the UKIP 's hypocrisy breathtaking .
The losers , sadly , will be our own citizens .
We have just been talking about chocolate .
We are facing an enormous challenge in terms of waste management .
However , I believe that some countries are not prepared for this either practically or theoretically .
The regulations on the limitation of discharges are gradually being reinforced .
My colleagues should also note another point , although this is of less importance .
In my opinion , however , an information campaign is needed following the merger of these directives .
The sorting of waste which they carry out therefore appears to be useless .
We must therefore set up a proper information and explanatory campaign .
Davies report ( A5-0062 / 2000 )
In the long term , this can even cause premature ageing of lungs .
It also introduces a framework of standards to protect human health and the environment .
The directive will therefore provide a benchmark for the levels of ozone in ambient air .
However , the Commission ' s proposals do not set a deadline for this to be achieved .
This is to be regretted .
As a first interim step , target values are set .
The aim is to achieve these , as far as possible , by 2010 .
These currently call for an 8 % reduction in a range of greenhouse gases .
Myller report ( A5-0063 / 2000 )
The ceilings indicated in this text must be complied with by 2010 at the latest .
The programmes are to be updated and revised by 2006 .
These inventories and projections must be reported to the Commission each year .
The rapporteur has proposed amendments to reinforce this proposal .
In principle I can only agree with these proposals .
However , setting the standards too high can be counterproductive .
I feel this is a good compromise .
The rapporteur also proposes setting target dates for achieving these objectives . This is essential .
Motion for a resolution on the Lisbon European Council
Despite current growth , job creation in Europe is notoriously inadequate .
Those jobs which are created tend to be precarious , particularly where they involve women and young people .
We must move away from simple declarations of intent , no matter how positive they may be .
In view of the extremely high social expectations , we must urgently define measurable and verifiable objectives .
The introduction of a process for reducing working time without any loss of wages or flexibility ;
For all these reasons we will vote against the joint motion .
This initiative is to be congratulated .
We must firstly set ambitious objectives .
This means that the workforce has to adapt to the new information technologies .
I therefore broadly support this programme .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.35 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Human rights , racism , xenophobia and antisemitism ( continuation )
Madam President , I should like to expressly thank Mr Belder for his report .
Racism , xenophobia and antisemitism are a depressing problem , including within the European Union .
This House is prepared to exercise diplomatic restraint in many areas , but not on this question .
And rightly so .
A number of proposed amendments by Baroness Ludford attempt to rectify this and I shall support them .
There is almost a total lack of analytical appraisal or special programmes to combat it .
Too often in the past EU Member States have allowed themselves to be blackmailed by China .
Capitulating to China was both immoral and cowardly .
It was cowardly also .
History has consistently shown that the correct approach is to stand up to a bully .
It treats the views of the outside world with contempt .
The aim is to create acceptable living conditions for all .
Everyone must be protected from poverty and exclusion .
Everyone is entitled to education , culture and health .
Everyone is entitled to decent housing and an income which allows them to live honourably .
We must declare that poverty will not be tolerated .
Could the idea of fraternity become the key concept for the 21st century ?
Fraternity must guarantee the rights of the poorest .
Our century will be a century of progress in which the wildest utopian ideals may be realised .
I would like to compliment the President on the wise decision to take these four reports together .
That is our grave criticism of the approach taken in this report .
We are all against racism and we all have a contribution to make .
There should be a broad consensus on this in this House .
I believe it has a place here .
What was happening 15 years ago in Austria was that Mr Haider was actually persecuting the Slovene-speaking minority there .
Very few of us wanted to stand up and say anything at the time .
Allow me to tell you which points we do not accept and why .
Secondly , we are against all the points which fly in the face of the basic principle of solidarity .
I consider this last point to be very important .
The report does not contain what the title promises .
Madam President , thanks are due to Mr Haarder for a basically splendid piece of work .
There is , nonetheless , one point on which I have to say that I disagree with the rapporteur .
I will therefore present Mr Hernández Mollar ' s intervention .
European citizenship is an abstract concept which lacks any legal form .
That was Mr Hernández Mollar ' s intervention .
I will now begin my own , Madam President .
This must be done whilst respecting their specific religious beliefs and cultural characteristics .
However , the administrative status of the resident is not the same as the political status of the citizen .
The report raises many relevant points .
Many Roma in the candidate Member States live in extremely abject conditions .
They are frequently at the receiving end of all kinds of discrimination .
We want the European Union to get more directly involved in order to address the problems of the Roma .
This should , first and foremost , be placed within a broader context .
Regional developments and a sound social policy are indispensable tools in this .
Roma often live in areas where everyone is struggling .
We want to adopt an approach from a local perspective .
At the same time , local cooperation is an effective tool against prejudice and discrimination .
The Roma ' s own contribution is also important .
As far as I am concerned , this too is a key word .
Roma need to be able to stand up for themselves more .
They need to become directly involved and given co-responsibility in order to improve their conditions .
In addition , there is a need for more specific action aimed at changing people ' s mentality .
The tendency to discriminate is often deep-rooted , even at government level .
This needs to be given special attention .
I also advocate sound cooperation between the European Union and the Council of Europe .
We should make better use of the expertise developed within these circles .
This is praiseworthy in itself .
We take them for granted , but it appears that in our ultra-civilised Europe they are not always observed .
However , where there is political responsibility this should not be a problem .
We must overcome this and incite our governments to be European through and through .
Those with ulterior motives might say that Europe is engaging in self-flagellation .
I believe that Europe is reviving its hopes and its prospects .
And when it comes to human rights , we must never ever make concessions .
The death penalty is an example .
All four reports on which we shall be voting are good reports .
In short , Turkey still fails to satisfy the Copenhagen criteria .
We are in favour of Turkey ' s joining the European Union .
However , we must not make concessions on questions of principle for anyone .
But we must help them with training .
The second group which I should like to mention are the Kurds .
I consider this stance to be wrong and one which contradicts the declarations of the Council of Europe .
The Belder report also states this unequivocally .
The Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia will open in Vienna on 7 April .
In some cases there has been agreement with the form but probably not with the content .
I have referred to our external presence and to the internal dimension .
Austria has undeniably been a country that has met its European Union obligations .
Today , in the European Union , citizenship means European citizenship .
An Austrian citizen is a Portuguese citizen .
A Portuguese citizen is an Austrian citizen .
This cannot be viewed as a matter of indifference to the other countries .
That simply is not true .
Let me start with the Malmström report .
I think the first annual report of this new European Parliament is thorough and timely .
I cannot respond to all of the points in the report at this stage .
The European initiative for democracy and human rights reflects this .
Women are explicitly included as a target group for support .
From the horrors of rape to genital mutilation , from the home to the prison cell .
Our programmes DAPHNE and STOP are the mainstay of the Commission 's response .
We produced a communication in 1998 on this subject .
NGOs and civil society partners are integral to their implementation .
The projects are often carried out in sensitive or dangerous conditions in the field .
The former is clearly as impossible as it would be totally undesirable .
We could not work without NGOs .
We will not , alas , see an overnight change .
The size of the budget cannot be divorced from the question of our capacity to manage it .
Broken promises can lead rapidly to bankruptcy .
I believe that such an agency should be operational , not advisory .
I will be exploring this in the communication .
I am responding to this on my own behalf and that of my colleague , Commissioner Verheugen .
I would like to congratulate the authors of the comprehensive report .
I hope this response will set a few pointers for the future .
These discussions have produced concrete results .
This reform helps to bring about the necessary changes in attitudes within institutions .
We will persevere with such measures .
We are also open to opportunities for strengthening them .
The new Access Programme which replaces the LIEN and Partnership Programmes aims to strengthen civil society .
These reports cover extremely important issues .
I am grateful to Parliament for its timely input .
The Commission and Parliament are well placed to work together on human rights .
We are well placed to give a strong lead to others .
Madam President , I too should like to ask in what capacity you made this statement .
It was not by chance at all !
That is quite clear .
I therefore share the rapporteur ' s and Parliament ' s concerns .
All these instruments are currently being examined by the Council .
These measures will aim to go beyond the joint action of February 1997 .
We felt that it was politically possible .
We sincerely hope that the facts will not deny our hope .
The proposed directives are complemented by a proposal for an action programme .
Parliament has a key role to play in this regard .
Madam President , allow me briefly to correct what the President-in-Office of the Council said .
At most , Mr President-in-Office , you can therefore only speak of twelve countries .
Madam President , I seldom make use of these rules but I must do so now for the record .
During the debate , Mr Gollnisch , a member of the French extreme right , attacked me personally .
Mr Schulz , we have noted your statement .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon .
The next item is the joint debate on :
In principle , the system is intended to correctly implement the Dublin Convention .
This Parliament was then consulted again in accordance with the provisions of Amsterdam .
This is not a trivial question .
But when it comes to EURODAC , we have a problem .
And we have given our reasons .
We highlighted all these problems in a resolution by Parliament .
It started back in Dublin in 1990 .
That too was a very positive aspect .
How will the system actually be configured ?
We hope that this will happen shortly , perhaps even during the Portuguese Presidency .
Some members are saying we should not fingerprint fourteen- to eighteen-year-olds .
I personally take a different view on this .
It is incomprehensible .
It comes down to how this system is seen under the rule of law .
The same applies to parliamentary scrutiny .
And believe me , we shall do so .
This is a legally uncertain basis for legislation and that makes me unhappy .
I am not sure that this has really been done .
Are the Council and the Commission so convinced ?
That means that we need instruments to exercise the necessary controls .
That is the task now before the Council .
It is , we feel , putting the cart before the horse .
It is a shame that we are currently being given the impression that we serve no useful purpose .
The Eurodac initiative is a series of absurdities and outrages .
I personally am among those who have serious reservations about the system .
I can also confirm that the Council did not ask the Commission to come forward with a revised proposal .
We considered that 14 years old is an adequate solution .
Nevertheless , I recognise this is a very sensitive question .
First , we should not ask Eurodac to give answers that Eurodac cannot give .
We will come to Parliament and the Council with proposals in the next few months .
We have just achieved , this week , a working document to re-evaluate the Dublin Convention itself .
We do not want to lose time .
Where is the point of difference between the Commission and the Council ?
But there is a point where the Commission does not agree with the Council .
We do not agree that the Council should reserve for itself the powers of implementation of the system .
Maybe I am being stubborn but this is what I sincerely believe .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The joint debate is closed .
Trade in bovine animals and pigs
However , here too we said that we wanted to help out .
We are calling for Article 17a to be deleted .
I hope that the Commission is able to accept this amendment .
This is a codecision process .
We have already had intensive discussions .
I am curious to see what the outcome of your position will be .
I hope this message is getting through to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer .
Mr President , I would like to join previous speakers in congratulating the rapporteur .
He has approached this matter with his usual conviction and great dedication .
These are already , of course , implemented by many other states .
This exemption has important implications for my country .
But instead of giving us more time , the Commission has commenced infringement proceedings .
Why is the Commission giving Spain such an easy time ?
On that basis , I believe that this proposed directive is wrong and I will be voting against it .
Routine post-mortem examinations are carried out by veterinary surgeons employed by the Department on all animals slaughtered .
Animals which react positively to the TB test are slaughtered .
The TB test we use now is herd-specific , not animal-specific .
We need to get to the stage where blood tests for individual animals will stand up .
Plus , animal epidemics are again costing us a great deal of money .
It is my opinion that this measure is suffering from a surfeit of rules .
Since 1964 , a series of laws have been adopted on this subject .
It is very likely that this is caused by difficulties in implementing the directives .
The second amendment seeks to restrict the period of application of transitional measures to two years .
Let me express my surprise and concern about this .
The overall aim is to achieve quick and efficient results in order to translate policy into legislative acts .
The framework for the comitology procedure is clearly established in the abovementioned Council decision .
The amended Directive 64 / 432 is based on Articles 37 and 152 of the Treaty .
That is , and I am advised by the legal service , the appropriate way to deal with this .
That is why each individual provision which envisages such an amendment must identify the procedure quite clearly .
Therefore these measures should not be subject to the right of scrutiny of Parliament .
I will now make some remarks on the implications of the proposed amendment for the institutional balance .
The procedure must be made clear in the basic legislative provision requiring to be amended by comitology .
They are quite different and must be dealt with quite separately .
Consequently I cannot accept the amendment of Mrs Auroi either .
You are , of course , quite correct in relation to that .
That agreement , however , was reached with the Council subsequent to the initial drafting of this document .
That is why it has been drafted in this way .
It pre-dates that agreement .
It will be automatically amended in the manner envisaged in the agreement with the Council .
You also suggested that if the Commission goes along with your suggestion that there will be a shortened procedure .
Mr President , allow me to ask Commissioner Byrne one more question .
We noticed that .
The legal text is therefore confirmed .
Then we can use the simplified procedure .
Generosity is incumbent upon the Commission , not the rapporteur .
It makes no sense to continue with the debate .
I would ask the Commissioner to reply as briefly as possible .
That gives clarity to the situation .
It avoids any exercise of discretion by the Commission or anybody else .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The relevant committee will continue the discussion of this issue .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Question Time ( Council )
Question No 1 by ( H-0141 / 00 ) :
Does the Council concur with that statement ?
A number of conclusions emerged from this work .
To this end , the Council recently adopted a decision authorising the Commission to negotiate on this very protocol .
Question No 2 by ( H-0148 / 00 ) :
If not , does it intend to launch the procedures referred to in Article 7 ?
Mr President , this question has already been broached here more than once .
All the European Union institutions were bypassed and presented with a fait accompli .
Hence my question : what will happen in the future if we disregard the case of Austria now ?
Will the national Prime Ministers of the countries of Europe pass judgement in future ?
Will a majority of eight votes suffice or will a different majority be needed ?
Is this a question of new competition between the European institutions and the national states ?
And , as I said , this would be a purely bilateral matter .
Here in the European Parliament , people speak , not parties .
Must each Member State individually abandon the sanctions before the Council comes to its senses and overturns the decision ?
I never said that the Austrian Government is a racist government , let me make that quite clear .
As for the other question you have raised , the answer is yes .
Any country can disassociate itself from the declaration made by the 14 countries .
First of all , there is no Council decision .
As I have already said , we are talking about 14 countries .
This is not a European Union issue .
Different individuals will have different perceptions of all this .
I personally do not like sitting alongside fascists .
Question No 3 by ( H-0151 / 00 ) :
In some cases , the fuel shortage has claimed human lives .
This programme started with two local authorities where the opposition held power .
We hope that this signal from the European Union will be heard by democratic forces in Serbia .
We are aware that this obviously has an impact on the civilian population .
And whether we like it or not , that is a fact .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I am grateful for your words but not for their content .
Do you not think that this is rather difficult for the European citizens to understand ?
Your comments make perfect sense .
You will also be aware that consular cooperation within the European Union is a recent development .
Question No 5 by ( H-0158 / 00 ) :
However , no non-member country has made use of this facility to date .
Thank you , Minister .
So do you have a feeling about how these discussions may develop in the IGC ?
Nevertheless , we will continue to maintain a dialogue with the European Parliament on this subject .
Question No 6 by ( H-0160 / 00 ) :
How exactly do things stand ?
This loan was signed and sealed and represents an obligation .
It collects every last cent of the loans which it grants .
This comes to some USD 40 billion .
Other countries have been paid .
Greece has not .
Germany has acknowledged its obligation from time to time .
However , it has failed to honour it on various pretexts .
I consider the reply by the President-in-Office to be unacceptable .
Question No 7 by ( H-0162 / 00 ) :
80 to 90 % of the films showing in Sweden are , however , American .
Does the Council agree that State aid is important to promote European culture ?
Does the Council not consider it important to encourage diversed European film production ?
I would like to thank the Council 's representative for his reply .
We are also concerned about this .
Question No 8 by ( H-0166 / 00 ) :
If we went down that path we would certainly be entering very dangerous territory .
This means that it cannot be accepted as a legitimate party in the democratic process .
Other countries have different systems and these have just as many virtues as my own .
Yes , but the problem , of course , is that this is what we are concerned with here .
Up until now , it is only opinions you are punishing and not actions .
It is therefore opinions which you have punished and not actions .
It is therefore quite natural , Mr Bonde , that certain governments should feel somewhat uneasy .
This uneasiness is only being reflected in bilateral relations .
We are not confusing Community matters with bilateral matters .
Question No 9 by ( H-0169 / 00 ) :
The current presidency has been following this practice .
I would like to thank the President-in-Office for a very long , detailed and serious reply .
Would you accept that principle ?
Mr President , during the Finnish presidency , we were able to get through twenty questions in question time .
Last time we covered twelve with Portugal as the country holding the presidency .
. ( PT ) I have two points to make , Mr Seppänen .
But we can also opt for a bureaucratic , officious , quick , artificial and probably unsatisfactory answer .
We would then - in quantitative terms - be more successful in giving answers to this House .
Excuse me , but could you put the question in a different way ?
You were saying that the Council is not alone in being a legislature that makes its decisions in secret .
Mr Seixas da Costa had informed us that he had to leave at 7.00 p.m.
He has also pointed out that he has been working with us since 9.00 a.m.
We will therefore conclude questions to the Council and thank him for being here .
Questions Nos 10 to 38 will be replied to in writing .
That concludes Questions to the Council .
( The sitting was closed at 7.00 p.m. )
Mr Evans has the floor .
Evans , Robert ( PSE ) .
All Members have , this morning , received a booklet containing 113 pages of roll-call votes .
I wonder if you could ask the services to have another look at this please , President .
Thank you , Mr Evans .
Your comments will be passed on , not to the services , of course , but to the Bureau .
EU-Mexico Interim Agreement
We cannot renegotiate the agreement .
All in all , our Group will vote in favour of this trade agreement , which we welcome .
In fact , chocolate - " chocolatl " - is a Mexican word .
We can therefore use past experience to help develop future relations with Mexico .
The advantage to Mexico is obvious .
Mexico stands to gain here by achieving a better trade equilibrium .
As far as trade is concerned , there are advantages all round .
I should like to go briefly into , or at least touch on , two problems .
When free trade increases , there are also losers .
Poverty in Mexico has risen rather than fallen .
The second is scientific and technical cooperation .
They see it as a chance to correct their one-way dependence on NAFTA .
The EU has kept derogations open for itself here .
Mexico has none !
" A free trade agreement at the cost of the Mexicans " .
Some points even contradict the Mexican constitution .
We here in the European Parliament do not oppose an agreement with Mexico .
On the contrary !
However , these criticisms are decisive , and have led us to oppose the motion .
All this is common knowledge and I need say no more .
What is more , this agreement means we are also strengthening the country ' s democratisation process .
But Mexico has also made great progress on human rights .
Our decision has nothing to do with her work , it relates to the situation in Mexico .
We are going to talk to non-governmental organisations .
We are also going to Chiapas to talk to the indigenous people and representatives of local society .
This agreement is based on human rights and democratic principles .
It covers all our relations with Mexico , notably cooperation and political dialogue .
The negotiating results are balanced , ambitious and offer a window of opportunity for both sides .
Thank you very much , Mr Liikanen .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
Information society for All
The adoption of the GSM standard has meant that the European Union has a tremendous advantage .
Other amendments are looking at matters relating to disability rights .
Finally , some comments , Mr President , on what the future holds .
Many thanks for your report and your skill , Mrs Read .
The new society must not exacerbate inequality between men and women .
And we want the European social model to be defended .
What must the European Union do within the framework of the e-Europe initiative ?
First : we must create an open , modern , high-performance multimedia infrastructure .
Secondly : we must quickly create a legal framework for electronic commerce .
Thirdly : we need an e-Europe test bench for European initiatives .
( The President cut the speaker off ) Mr President , I apologise .
Please be so kind as to allow me to finish my sentence .
We must not forget people with disabilities .
We can also see this from the follow-up document prepared by the Commission .
The United States occupies second place .
Finland , Norway and Denmark follow , in that order .
Scandinavia is acquitting itself well with its social infrastructure and also , perhaps , with its pensions systems .
We ought to bear this in mind , something I am convinced the Commission has done .
This must be reflected in the action plan .
It is widely maintained that telephone companies are not making use of the available technology because standards are lacking .
I am glad that this point is made in the report .
The Internet , e-mail and mobile telephones will apparently do away with unemployment .
But the reality of the matter is somewhat different .
The IT boom is confronted by mergers and redundancies .
History teaches us that this approach has failed .
Industrialisation , atomic energy and biotechnology have not brought freedom and prosperity for all .
We should hold our principle of equal opportunity up to the light of truth .
In the case of information technology , however , we start with a totally different set of coordinates .
For example , there are numerous initiatives to promote the Internet and computers in schools .
That brings me to my next controversial point : civil rights .
What we in fact need is a concept for universal data protection .
It is being used to deliberately plan and implement a further massive restriction of fundamental rights at European level .
How can these two things be reconciled ?
In the light of " echelon " , I am calling for a rethink of this matter .
Data protection and encoding are what we need .
For the rest , the citizens must control the state , not the other way around .
These are two different things .
The information society is the chaos society .
Their revolution has been to sell computers and software to everyone .
The rest of us should start a counter-revolution .
We should set our aims higher than the Commission has done .
We have to demand a knowledge society for all rather than the chaotic information society we are getting .
( The President cut the speaker off )
The ' new economy ' is here to stay , in Europe too .
The amount is much too small .
In this connection , it is important to ensure that guarantees are provided for advertising purposes .
Far-reaching harmonisation concerning commercial communication is therefore urgently needed .
That means it is lagging behind the United States which , indeed , no one would deny .
But having said that , we should evaluate the quality of this backwardness : economic , political and social .
How do we measure it ?
The Commission says it wants to launch a political initiative , so let us take it at its word .
Yes , it is backward in terms of the development of e-commerce made possible by the Internet .
But are these two forms of backwardness the same ?
That is the impression the Commission ' s initiative could give .
Will that content be standardised or will it reflect the cultural and linguistic diversity of Europe ?
Will it be a social content or purely market-related ?
We need to evaluate them properly .
The Commission refers to Europe ' s backwardness and the need to make up for it .
Technological progress is an all-too familiar slogan .
In fact , the transformation we are witnessing is reminiscent of what happened with the invention of printing .
We need to reflect very seriously about the challenges and changes it is bringing about .
One such example is , of course , the area of education .
We live at a time when education is becoming ever more important as a factor in production .
Knowledge has a clear tendency to increase or to expand when it is used .
It opens the door to incredibly exciting developments where democracy and justice are concerned .
I would urge Mr Liikanen to have a detailed discussion with Mr Nielson on that issue .
Thank you , Mr Liikanen and Mrs Read , for an interesting report .
However , I should like to raise three points which perhaps merit our attention .
Improvements are therefore needed here .
Secondly : how will our working life and employment relations change ?
Will people be able to influence how they are organised ?
Greater account needs to be taken of this .
Legislators cannot keep up with this technology even if they try to .
Technology and industry are better equipped to respond to consumer concerns in what is an immensely competitive market .
But we all know that we need a base line of government involvement .
We need a basic legislative framework for e-commerce .
( The President cut the speaker off )
That is a task for the Council , Parliament and the Commission .
I wish us all a great deal of success in the interests of our citizens .
It is important , and I thank her for it .
It will not be so if the basic rights of employees are not safeguarded .
This , I think , should be stopped .
First there is the pragmatic deficit .
I would not like to believe the Council ' s conclusions will be restricted to this list .
And finally there is the investment deficit .
How can we become more competitive ?
How can we create new markets ?
How can we create permanent , more highly-qualified jobs ?
Europe has talents .
Europe has skills .
Occasionally we lack competent directors to motivate us .
They need to familiarise themselves with the Internet and data bases from an early age .
Mrs Hieronymi pointed that out .
Schools without computers must become the exception .
We need a qualification offensive with computer-aided learning and active use of networks .
The pace of change is hotting up in the European economy .
Undertakings are subject to constant restructuring , new holdings , strategic alliances and friendly or hostile takeovers .
Independence is increasing , as is pseudo-independence .
Within companies , responsibilities are changing .
Teams have shorter and shorter sell-by dates .
That has repercussions for the internal composition and the representation of the interests of employees .
The significance of e-commerce is difficult to overestimate .
We must allow the market , that is to say purchasers and vendors , to choose for themselves .
That is definitely the best way of making information services available to all citizens .
Avoid being so fearful and negative .
Take Mrs Villiers ' insights on board .
Adopt Mr Wijkman ' s global and positive attitude , and learn from young Mrs Kauppi ' s experiences .
We welcome the contribution of Parliament to this very important policy debate .
The Commission is currently contributing to the preparation of next week 's summit in Lisbon .
Your support to move forward on these key elements of e-Europe is most welcome .
I would like to mention especially the communication " Strategies for Jobs in the Information Society " .
Your report expresses concern about the smart card action .
The aim is not to disadvantage other technologies .
Finally , I would like to close by thanking you once again for your work in this area .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
( Parliament agreed to the request )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Mr President , one other brief point .
It violates the Rules of Procedure and should not happen again .
I have some sympathy with that remark .
Perhaps we should ask the Rules of Procedure Committee to look at the precise procedural methods we use here .
The Commission has not expressed its opinion on that .
We do not know exactly what the situation is at present .
I also think Parliament cannot be both judge and judged .
I am not going to debate it .
The easier thing is to put it to the vote .
( Parliament rejected the proposal )
Mrs Isler Béguin was not in committee on the days we discussed these subjects .
However , I wanted to point this out .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Joint motion for a resolution on support for the Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 and international humanitarian law
( Parliament adopted the joint resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
I would like to know whether this clause has the same meaning in his language .
Mr President , I believe I can shed some light on the matter .
This a serious translation error .
I think this is the root of the problem .
I am able to confirm that it is Mr Imbeni ' s interpretation which is the correct one .
Mr President , if we change the meaning of the paragraph , the debate will start all over again .
It is a common occurrence in this Parliament for texts not to correspond .
This time , according to some versions , we are told to protect child abusers .
That would overcome all the difficulty .
There is no ambiguity , there is no uncertainty .
It is the English version which is correct .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Mr President , I should like to make a point of order .
This is not a legislative report .
So I agree with you one hundred percent .
That hardly constitutes a point of order .
I suppose I cannot win .
Mr President , you mentioned that you wanted to break off now .
I urgently request that you continue the vote .
We are fed up with constant changes to the agenda and postponements at short notice .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I understand what is being asked here .
The members have already left !
Even the rapporteur does not want that .
For the rest , we can still vote at 5.30 this evening .
That is quite in order .
We have already overrun by 45 minutes .
I suggest that we vote this evening .
Mr President , I should like to request that it not be taken this evening .
The vote will be totally distorted .
We know that a lot of people will leave this afternoon .
They do not expect this kind of vote on a Thursday afternoon .
Could we not postpone it until the April plenary session in Strasbourg ?
This is shameful .
We have been here for less than two hours and we have already had enough .
What would sailors , pilots , drivers , petrol station workers and doctors say ?
Mr President , I am sorry but I asked for the floor at the start .
Two specific points .
First , I wanted to vote for , not against proposed amendment 24 .
Perhaps all the members should be reminded of that .
Mr President , perhaps I can be of help here .
The rapporteur has stated that she agrees with your suggestion , i.e. with the President ' s suggestion .
Please let us proceed thus .
Sarah Ludford has stated that she agrees with that .
So , we vote at 5.30 p.m. on postponing the Ludford report to the next plenary session .
That is my motion .
There is absolutely no problem with that .
It is well within the Rules . It can be done immediately before the vote .
It is normal procedure . That is why I cannot take it now .
The Rules say you move postponement before the vote on the matter .
That concludes the votes .
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Graefe zu Baringdorf report ( A5-0044 / 2000 )
Ferrer report ( A5-0066 / 2000 )
For all those reasons , we shall vote against ratifying this agreement .
Duff / Voggenhuber report ( A5-0064 / 2000 )
Who was consulted beforehand ?
No one , and certainly not the national parliaments , who had never heard of it .
Yes , I did say " the Commission " .
That is quite ludicrous !
I would also like to have seen support for Mr Vidal ' s proposal .
We cannot keep setting criteria for candidate countries which we fail to meet ourselves .
A European constitution could provide the initial impetus for a superstate of this kind .
However , I had to consider their view of the world in my deliberations .
This is why I was unable to support their proposals .
That is definitely a fundamental right worth defending in the European Union .
A Charter could make a positive contribution to this .
It is therefore unrealistic to expect the issues to have been resolved by December .
We have made this known in the individual votes en route to the report .
The Charter is an expression of the EU ' s ambition to bring the EU closer to its citizens .
This way of thinking is fundamentally different from our own vision of a European Community .
The Union is , and should remain , a union of States .
Nor do we support the constitutional process of which the adoption of a Charter is an integral part .
We are therefore voting against the whole report .
So we must provide for direct resort to that Court in accordance with certain procedures .
The people of Europe expect us to take a very bold approach here .
Our demands are quite clear .
The Charter must have fully binding legal status by being incorporated in the Treaty .
The European Parliament must approve any secondary legislation that might have a bearing on these fundamental rights .
We need more time and debate on these potential conflicts .
A Charter of this kind should be based on the most progressive acquis and combine social and democratic rights .
The Charter should concentrate on the relationship between citizens and the European institutions .
Its primary objective should be to guarantee that the Union is governed openly .
The Charter should be legally binding through its also being incorporated into the EU ' s Treaty .
However , we are at a very early stage in the process of determining the Charter .
It is therefore too early to say what should be legally binding .
This is a recognisable aim which British Labour Members would support .
In my view , a declaration would be more appropriate .
Jackson resolution ( B5-0227 / 2000 )
These are vital life-line funds for jobs and growth .
That is a laudable and necessary ambition .
Malmström report ( A5-0060 / 2000 )
Under these circumstances , we are abstaining from the vote on this report .
The European Union has many instruments available in this field .
There are also specific and horizontal actions relating to a given policy .
They include , in particular , the fight to abolish the death penalty .
Obviously I agree with that .
I want to express my unconditional support for that demand !
Allegations that such an ' Echelon network ' exists are based on hearsay and circumstantial evidence .
For example , we do not share the enthusiasm for an EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Many of us do not support the abolition of capital punishment in principle .
And we are suspicious about proposals to impose further codes of conduct on business .
It is for these reasons that British Conservatives have voted against the Malmström resolution .
Haarder report ( A5-0050 / 2000 )
The supporters of that theory should get their act together .
Mr President , I should like to follow on from what Mrs Lulling has just said .
On the contrary , it is a guarantee of human rights .
Hence our support in principle .
That same article defines the family in terms of the marriage between a man and a woman .
We must grasp these new opportunities .
The European Parliament must , therefore , remain vigilant .
This is an issue which requires deeper analysis .
- I believe that this is a good report and deserves support .
I voted for these paragraphs because I agree with the objectives of the rapporteur .
I would , however , like to ensure that my voting intentions are not misinterpreted .
Firstly , I do not support the right of gay couples to adopt .
Secondly , I do not support the lowering of the age of consent below 18 years of age .
With these clarifications entered for the record I am happy to vote for Mr Haarder 's report .
This section is poorly drafted and ambiguous .
But the fact remains that this is a choice and not an obligation .
Its attitude towards the Turkish regime is a blatant example .
The European Parliament is proposing to take part in drafting a European Charter of Fundamental Rights .
And why not ?
And , above all , what are we to think of our House ' s concept of these rights ?
Freedom is not something that can be decreed .
An additional charter , European or not , will certainly not provide them .
We do not wish to participate in this and would emphatically disassociate ourselves from this kind of practice .
Perhaps that is what this whole exercise demands .
Alas , the 2000 vintage still goes along with this curious tradition .
This role has been downgraded for far too long , although it is a key role .
That kind of policy would mean giving the family its due place .
But this report is an extremely dangerous all-out attack on the family .
He is worth much more than that : every man is a sacred history .
" We fully subscribe to the international agreements to protect minorities and minority languages .
That concludes the explanations of vote .
( The sitting was adjourned at 2.11 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Topical and urgent debate
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
The next item is the debate on the following motions for resolutions :
on the Western Sahara .
I am not shocked .
We do not want Western Sahara to become another East Timor , Mr President ,
That is why we support the motion for a resolution .
Stability , security and peace in the Maghreb region depend on this referendum taking place .
Direct dialogue between the parties is essential .
Regrettably , the Union has not acted in the most appropriate way up to now .
Much has been said , but little has actually been done .
That is how we can contribute to achieving a priority objective : peace in the Maghreb .
Self-determination in Western Sahara is essential for that .
The constant postponement of the referendum on the future of the Western Sahara is unacceptable .
A state of emergency reins in the occupied areas .
The supply situation has deteriorated dramatically .
The Commission must set up a financial safety fund for the next three months .
We had a similarly dramatic situation a year ago in East Timor .
A referendum was held . A state of emergency followed .
I also want to take the opportunity to appeal to the Council .
I am also particularly glad that Commissioner Nielson is present here today .
They have ceased to provide aid and there is no effective coordination .
Mr President , the Western Sahara issue is , unfortunately , familiar .
Even today , this right is still being suppressed , under various different pretexts .
Nor has it confined itself to these delaying tactics .
The United Nations must do its utmost to ensure that the referendum is held before the end of 2000 .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Nielson .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0263 / 2000 by Mrs Carrilho and others on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists ;
on the floods in Mozambique .
But we alone should not bear the blame for the delay .
We should also be wondering what other countries in other continents are doing .
What about India and Pakistan , which have substantial resources and large communities resident in Mozambique ?
And what are the nearby African countries doing ?
But we need to make a distinction between the different situations of many African countries .
Mr President , the media have portrayed a distorted image of the disaster which struck Mozambique .
According to the organisations involved , despite everything , aid has got under way relatively quickly .
This may be true , but this does not apply to the primary rescue operations .
It was not the Commission which was responsible for this , but the governments .
Aircraft , helicopters , food and medicine must be available on demand and at a moment ' s notice .
And I mean literally at a moment ' s notice .
The waiting period should only be determined by the distance involved , not the red tape .
There is a need for much better cooperation between the aid organisations and the armed forces to this end .
It is commendable that Commissioner Nielson travelled to Mozambique so quickly .
Mozambique has now entered an extremely difficult phase .
The European Union must never behave like this again .
In particular the Member States must cancel their share of Mozambique ' s external debt .
It is sad that this should happen to one of the world ' s poorest countries as well .
I think it would be fitting to pay tribute to them for these efforts .
The funding which has been set aside for this project is considerable .
Mr Van den Bos has also pointed this out .
I think it is only fair to clarify this here .
A donor core group is meeting every week in Maputo with the government at ministerial level .
The EU presidency and the Commission delegation are members of that group .
Additional resources , up to EUR 15 m , could be made available .
Constraints have been identified in this terrible disaster case .
This is not easily done .
Finally , I would like to emphasise the figures concerning the international response .
In money terms we have contributed quite well .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Nielson .
We all hope that our aid really will help the people get over the worst of it .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
Presidential elections in Peru
on the electoral process in Peru .
War crimes in Chechnya
B5-0271 / 2000 by Mrs Schroedter and others on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance
on violations of human rights and humanitarian law in Chechnya .
Freedom of the press in Serbia
on freedom of the press in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
Situation in Iraq
on the situation in Iraq .
Situation in Jammu and Kashmir
B5-0250 / 2000 by Mr Swoboda on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists ;
on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir .
Presidential elections in Peru :
The European Parliament has already had occasion to condemn this type of action by President Fujimori .
But the guarantees are not complete .
That means the guarantees are not complete .
There is no independence of the judiciary or of the legislature .
I think we should ask the Government of Peru to review that decision .
I should also like to warn against judging just one side and apportioning blame solely to the Russian side .
They must be investigated and the guilty must be called consistently to account .
But we should also give the competent Russian authorities the chance to do this themselves .
Mr President , I must contradict Mr Markov quite categorically .
What we need is the international criminal court and we must bring those responsible to justice .
That is why I warn against a pseudo balanced approach .
So we need to ensure that a negotiated solution is reached with the elected representatives of the Chechen people .
We interceded for the release of the Russian journalist Mr Babitsky .
It is a scandal and we cannot accept it .
Freedom of the press for Russia is also a service to the Russian people .
It seems to be becoming a permanent phenomenon in the region .
We have condemned the Russian action over the recent months in five separate resolutions .
Thirdly , the war must be stopped and talks begun .
In this we recognise the short-sightedness of our own policies .
Except that the Russian government does not appear to be totally convinced of the fact .
We reject and shall not accept any unilateral interpretation of the agreement by the Russian government .
Freedom of the press in Serbia :
This is something which the world ' s dictators have always known .
This is now happening every day in Serbia .
Mr Milosevic and his fellow criminals must be removed . Democracy must be saved .
The situation in Yugoslavia is deteriorating by the day .
Tension surrounding Montenegro is mounting .
It shows that every effort is being made to keep out outside influences .
I find this a dangerous game .
It seems to be heralding the elections in a perverse kind of way .
The campaign has started and anyone who disagrees with him needs to keep their mouths shut .
The EU makes a difference . The EU has made a difference in the past with its support .
The programmes are ready , the necessity is there ; let us take swift and unambiguous action .
Alternative reports can be directly provided via stations in Croatia and also in Montenegro .
It is unfortunate that the internal opposition is so weak and so divided nationally .
It has become clear over the last two years that the media are being increasingly sidelined .
But we have already said that .
The target , regional radio and television stations , is an obvious one from a Milosevic viewpoint .
Milosevic ' s willing servants are then welcome to hold on to the confiscated technical equipment .
Situation in Iraq :
Imposed on the Iraqi people I should say .
That is why our resolution calls for this embargo to be lifted .
Mr Eric Rouleau , the former French Ambassador , speaks of a slow-motion genocide .
Our resolution therefore calls for an end to this situation .
However , we also think we need a broader debate on this subject .
That is why we are not putting this resolution to the vote today .
We are therefore proposing that this debate be deferred to the month of April .
I feel that we should focus our attention on the possibility of preventing this from happening .
Iraqis are not going to die of starvation .
I feel that our resolution should also serve to reassure the State of Israel .
So the debate continues and the resolutions are withdrawn .
Mr President , I too am sorry that the vote will not now be taking place .
I am concerned , as are the other speakers , at the plight of the people in Iraq .
We want to make that message as loud and clear and unequivocal as we possibly can .
It cannot continue .
We have to support all available initiatives .
We are not the ones in the hot seat when it comes to taking initiatives .
What we must not do is keep quiet .
But whatever happens , the human rights abuses must stop .
That woman was sobbing her heart out .
I could almost touch the pain , really feel the pain of that woman .
That was not an isolated incident , and it is still happening today .
We must find a solution .
They must come to the negotiating table .
It is long overdue , for the reasons which our previous speakers have already underlined .
Tensions are also being aggravated by the fact that these two countries are nuclear powers .
This is why I welcome the debate on this conflict today .
Very often , the people who actually live there are not taken into account .
This appears to have awakened world opinion again .
I am convinced that international mediation is desirable and necessary .
Unfortunately , the Lahore process came to a standstill during the clash over Kargil between May and July 1999 .
The latest development in Kashmir is worrying .
India has repeatedly accused the government and Islamabad of backing the guerrillas with technical and military know-how .
The political and military situation needs to be further stabilised in order to create a climate for bilateral talks .
On the human rights situation in Chechnya I have the following comments .
We are still waiting for an answer from the Russian authorities on these concrete proposals .
The increasing pressure put on the independent media shows just how important those media are .
The European Commission has made great efforts to support the independent media in Serbia .
In December 1999 we approved a EUR 3.3 million programme of support .
Satellite equipment is being distributed across the region to Croatia , Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia .
This will only prolong the crisis in Iraq .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Nielson .
The debate is closed .
Combatting organised crime
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
That is the first point which I wished to make here .
The second is a political challenge which , in my view , we are not taking seriously enough .
The instruments to fight organised crime are organised at intergovernmental level .
Where I live , in the district of Aachen , there is a town called Herzogenrath .
The European Union is making a substantial contribution to the reconstruction of the former Yugoslavia .
The Adriatic is a border and so is the Ionian Sea .
Mr President , when it comes to this issue , I am in two minds .
Of course , Montenegro also has internal security problems , as we do in the EU for that matter .
We must be careful not to give him an excuse .
The results of the activities of these task groups recorded over the last few years are particularly significant .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Nielson .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
She has had to leave earlier on account of a death and funeral in the family .
In this intervention , I would like to focus on three risks .
We urge the Commission and Member States not to go along with this .
The list of illegally traced ivory is already so extensive that a legal hunt would only exacerbate the problem .
Re-legalisation would only further reward bad behaviour .
This is the result of a typically isolated view of an animal generally threatened with extinction .
It is about a battle between civilisation and barbarism .
Animals are , by definition , not just there for our amusement .
It is only right that a civilised society should give their beastly fate more attention .
The Dutch Minister was the only one to vote for the conservation of the elephant .
This blood money also ends up in the wrong hands .
This is scandalous .
Mr President , the European Community is not a party to CITES .
The Gaborone amendment to the CITES text from 1983 would allow us to become a party to the Convention .
This legislation is amongst the most thorough and comprehensive of its kind in the world .
However , our general orientation on the major issues is as follows :
We should therefore oppose the Japanese and Norwegian proposals to restart the trade .
We should not support any of the proposals that have been made .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Nielson .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
Can I be told at whose request , and what reasons were given for withdrawing that ?
Perhaps Mr Swoboda can briefly explain what is behind this .
Mr President , you are quite right , we have withdrawn the motions for resolutions .
That was our reason for withdrawing them .
Thank you , Mrs Grossetête , I think the reasons are now clear .
Mr Buttiglione wishes to raise a point of order .
Thank you , Mr Buttiglione .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
Vote ( continuation )
Let us proceed with the vote .
Mr President , I should just like to ask why the sudden change of mind by the members .
Mr Posselt , I suggest that you ask them yourselves later .
I do not want a public debate in plenary on the matter .
Before the vote on Amendment 53
I am against ethnic classifications , because that would stigmatise immigrants .
Amendments 53 and 55 called for the term " ethnic " to be deleted .
Those are the reasons why I decided to withdraw these two amendments .
Thank you .
We have noted your remarks .
We are not therefore voting on it .
( Parliament approved the motion for a resolution )
I would ask for this to be considered .
Mr President , I freely admit that I have room for improvement .
Mr Swoboda , that applies to both of us !
We spent a very long time voting on this .
We could have done it much more quickly because the position has been quite clear .
Mr Speroni wishes to raise a point of order .
I am certain it was a problem of translation .
I am convinced of it .
( Parliament approved the motion for a resolution )
( Parliament approved the motion for a resolution )
Most of our group therefore abstained or voted against .
Our reasons were as follows .
I consider that unacceptable .
My Group has therefore been compelled either to abstain or to vote against the report .
( Applause )
Yet we certainly do not go along with the way Parliament is congratulating itself .
That obviously violates the Treaty right away .
It is badly drafted .
And I could give further examples of this kind of thing to justify our abstention .
We abstained on point 10 .
I do not think this kind of resolution does any credit to our Parliament .
I think the approach taken in these reports is a kind of violation of our terms of reference .
I think that second category is highly significant .
For there is indeed a strong risk that people will simply become used to the situation .
I repeat : the great risk is that it will become part of everyday life .
I personally am prepared to take this fight to the bitter end .
One other proposal deserves our full attention .
For those reasons , our vote is in favour of the report .
This report totally fails to provide a balanced approach .
It is damaging through its stridency .
It offers only a defeatist agenda , not one of a positive nature .
Those of us who really care know the great difficulties of this subject .
- ( FR ) Europe is facing real difficulties today .
But that was not to be .
Oh how wonderful it must be to live in China , in Cuba or in North Korea !
This is not serious .
Today , the Ludford report puts us at a remove from that Europe .
Report ( A5-0055 / 2000 ) by Mr Belder
All this creates fertile ground for the rise in forms of racism .
I am thinking particularly of the Roma , who face intolerable discrimination in several Central and Eastern European countries .
I am also thinking , obviously , of the problem of the institutionalised discrimination against the Kurdish people .
Sadly , Mrs Zana ' s case is no exception !
Turkey needs to make considerable progress in relation to respect for the Kurdish population .
That is the condition for its accession to the European Union and there can be no compromise on that !
ECB foreign reserve assets
The ECB must , at the very least , be financially independent .
In the short term , this income varies with interest rates .
The ECB ' s other source of income is the interest on its official reserves .
The Treaty provides for a mechanism whereby the ECB can forearm itself against any erosion of its capital .
The European Central Bank can partially or totally retain the monetary income from the Eurosystem .
Nevertheless , a central bank that depended on being bailed out repeatedly would not be very credible .
So it is imperative to resolve this structural problem as quickly as possible .
I have not proposed what might be called a political resolution to my colleagues .
In this case it is a question of saying yes or no .
A massive yes vote also sends out a political message .
The Central Bank has everything to gain from this improved transparency with regard to consolidating its credibility .
So its role is not just to satisfy the expectations of the financial markets .
What is the legal basis for today ' s debate ?
This call must be issued in the form of a regulation by the EU Council .
The ECB is currently calling for a further increase of 50 billion euros .
We know that it sustained a loss in 1999 .
Its financing requirements must be covered so that its independence cannot be called into question .
Thirdly : this increase will enhance the ability of the ECB to react and adapt .
It gives it the possibility to react more flexibly because it has the necessary funds at its disposal .
The following reasons are given : first , the Treaty makes provision for this .
Secondly , the ECB should gain in financial independence .
Before an answer can be given , the following questions at least must be considered :
Sixthly : what specific grounds are there for assuming that the ECB will probably sustain a loss in 1999 ?
Mr President , the European Central Bank is recommending to the Council that it double its foreign reserve assets .
To that end , it puts forward two very different kinds of argument .
No , really , we care little whether the ECB does or does not double its nuisance value .
That is reason enough for us to vote against this text .
They all seem to be becoming rather more realistic again now .
Yet it is a revealing slip of the pen .
The Commission has therefore adopted a favourable opinion on the ECB ' s recommendation .
Thank you , Commissioner Nielson .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
( The sitting was closed at 7.35 p.m. )
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
We cannot afford for the European Union to make a bad impression again .
We take note of your comments , Mr Zimmerling .
This was an unfair comment .
No one could , by the wildest stretch of the imagination , consider someone like Emma Bonino a racist .
People have rights and I do not think that the comment that was made yesterday was acceptable .
We take note of your comments , Mrs McKenna .
Very well , Mr Seppänen , we also take note of your comments .
I would ask that my attendance be recorded in yesterday ' s Minutes .
That will not be a problem .
I do not know whether I have picked the right moment to say this .
It does not concern the Minutes , but relates to something else .
Can I go ahead ?
I would ask the parliamentary services to look into why it was left out .
I can assure you that the services will look into this very closely , Mr Poettering .
I conclude this from the minutes .
Very well , Mr Manders , we take note of all of that .
( The Minutes were approved )
Our abstention expresses our opposition to both the national and the European organisation of the banking system .
Consequently , another question arises regarding the effective use of financial resources .
CAP : information measures
They avoid dealing with the CAP in a passive , purely bureaucratic and technological fashion .
That is why we believe that Parliament 's amendments improve the text .
Mr President , that is all I have to say .
This means that the EU ' s agricultural arrangements are of benefit to all EU citizens .
The common agricultural policy is always undergoing change and development .
Hence the importance of our amendment designed to supplement the concept set out in the report .
We hope that this amendment will be adopted .
Mr President , I welcome this measure .
From an administrative point of view the formalisation is a good thing .
The common agricultural policy gets a lot of criticism .
These have to be explained , not only to farmers , but to consumers as well .
It is important that we apply as many resources as possible to this .
To devote as many resources as possible to good relations is a wise policy .
In this way , the implementation of agricultural policy is facilitated .
Now I would like to speak about Parliament ' s proposed amendments .
They are not generally aimed at changing the subject matter but rather at amending the proposals .
All agricultural organisations and rural players fall within the scope of aid according to Article 2 .
This being the case , the proposed addenda are unnecessary .
Amendments Nos 5 , 8 and 10 concern measures that are eligible for aid .
They are unnecessary , as they are already contained in the Commission ' s proposal .
The purpose of this regulation is not to offer farmers any special services .
Local bodies are better qualified to do that .
The resources available would not be sufficient for that either .
The Commission is prepared , however , to adopt this amendment .
Amendment No 10 concerns Article 5 .
That is why it makes no sense to repeat the contents of the model in further detail .
Amendments Nos 7 and 13 concern contributions .
The funds available are modest .
Amendments Nos 9 and 12 concern the allocation and approval of appropriations .
As we know , Parliament is a budgetary authority together with the Council .
For this reason , the Commission thinks Amendment No 9 is not necessary .
Amendment No 11 concerns evaluation .
The Commission agrees with Parliament on the usefulness of regular evaluation .
It can best be taken account of in the implementing regulation .
Amendment No 4 concerns administration .
This extra recital is unnecessary in the regulation , in the opinion of the Commission .
Amendments Nos 1 and 3 concern linguistic nuances .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
I would like to highlight the following aspects of the amendments proposed by the European Parliament .
First , Amendment No 1 on the inclusion of a Recital 2a .
Aid for seeds already exists for rice , chickpeas and lentils .
However , this has still not been done .
Secondly , successive periods show that we are faced with a chronic imbalance in this system .
Another sector which requires this type of product is livestock farming .
There are two Commission documents that serve as a basis for the issue of grain legumes .
What vegetables are we actually talking about ?
What are the conclusions of the Commission ' s report ?
There are two conclusions to be drawn from this .
So how could the system be improved ?
This is a reference to Amendment No 2 .
The other reason is that it might involve extra expense .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
The next item is the debate on the following oral questions to the Commission :
Therefore central government expenditure is reduced .
Yet when the Commission looks at additionality it is dealt with on a Member State level .
This is a clear contradiction .
The rules as they stand allow this to happen .
I would like to develop a number of elements of previous answers .
There are two major news stories breaking in the United Kingdom today .
Now these stories are not just topical background to this debate .
What progress is being made in relation to the approval of the programming documents within the Commission ?
So , will the Commission undertake to make that information available to all Members of the European Parliament ?
Will they undertake to keep us informed in relation to these matters ?
Mr President , I should just like to touch on a couple of points that Mr Evans raised .
I would not like to make political capital out of it .
There are too many jobs at stake .
Secondly , he also mentioned their by-election .
I congratulate his party in securing a victory in this by-election .
I turn to the question at hand .
I thank the Nationalists for having raised this .
It is right that we have a proper discussion on the whole question of the Structural Funds .
But I suspect there is a deeper plot here .
What are they actually trying to achieve ?
I listened to Ms Evans .
Is it therefore Parliament 's role now to change that ?
We should not change that .
The role of this Parliament is to ensure that the rules are complied with .
That is what we should concentrate on .
I should like to read out the statement made by Commissioner Barnier after that meeting :
We have always been satisfied in the past that the national requirements have been met " .
Such regional systems of government are normally financed in whole or in part from central government funds .
At the very least , this engenders a lack of transparency .
We therefore call on the Commission to ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
We are now into to the third or fourth programme .
It reduced in real terms by 30 % .
So where did the Structural Funds go ?
Mr President , I am going to refer to a subject that none of the previous speakers has discussed .
I am referring to the report by the Court of Auditors on the principle of additionality .
This report contains a very interesting section - section 62 - that discusses privatisation .
And the response given to us by the Commission in section 62 is very short .
That is , the Commission is replying using the Olendorf method .
The second issue is that the Berlin financial forecasts anticipated a substantial reduction in the Structural Funds .
I suspect that this principle is being seriously violated in the Member States .
That is simply unacceptable .
' Difficult ' indeed , Sir .
One of the worst offenders in this connection is the UK .
No additional money has been built into the budget of our Welsh Assembly .
This is clear non-compliance .
I think some momentum is being lost , Mr President .
I was talking to councils in Wales yesterday .
They need this scheme to go ahead .
We pay the taxes that make up the grants that other areas receive .
We have no Objective 1 funding .
So , why do I speak ?
Because even in the south-east of England there are pockets of deprivation .
It gets no support from Europe .
Why not ?
I think they might win that case .
He has recommended that the Commission and EUROSTAT should look again at this particular problem .
Their worst nightmares have turned out to be reality .
The Labour Party heartlands of Scotland have sent them an unmistakable message .
The Scottish Labour voter - for so long taken for granted - has spoken .
Commissioner : three questions :
I request that Mr Barnier gives a written summary of his response to these points .
I am sure that Commissioner Barnier will be willing to follow up on this interesting debate .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on 11 April .
Adjournment of the session
( The sitting was closed at 10.50 a.m. )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 17 March 2000 .
Statement by the President
Eleven people were killed in an avalanche and that is not the final death toll .
It may be worse yet .
The next few hours will tell .
I should like to correct it because the meaning has been distorted .
It should read " will never distance " .
We feel that these actions taken by Turkey against Members of Parliament are cause for very serious concern .
Thank you , Mrs Morgantini .
We shall , of course , look into the matter thoroughly .
Thank you , Mr Galeote Quecedo .
Something quite astonishing for this type of meeting occurred .
Everyone was quite dumbfounded by this attitude .
It is imperative to restore good relations , and we therefore deplore this incident most strongly .
Of course , Mr Berthu .
This is certainly a quite regrettable incident .
Mr Tajani , you are quite right .
I did approach the Iranian government , but received no response .
You can count on me , therefore , to try again .
Tomorrow ' s agenda includes the topic of human cloning .
Ladies and gentlemen , I should like to get on with the items on the agenda .
I do not think that all these contributions are genuine points of order .
We do still have two of them , though .
Madam President , I shall be very brief .
These are the extreme left-wing ideas represented in this House .
Unless we therefore consider that they benefit ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Let us see if Mr Katiforis ' contribution is a genuine point of order .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr Katiforis , we shall look into it , thank you .
( Applause )
The next item is the order of business .
Relating to Wednesday
Are there any objections to this request ?
There do not seem to be any objections .
In that case , this will be the arrangement .
( Mr Gollnisch spoke to object and to request that this be put to the vote )
It is your right as a Member of Parliament .
I shall therefore put to the vote the request to bring forward the debate on hushkits .
( Parliament gave its assent )
Are there any objections ?
( Parliament gave its assent )
Relating to Thursday
I shall give the floor to Mr Watson , who is the chairman of this committee .
We will hear statements by the Commission and Council presidency tomorrow on the interception of communications .
The item is on the agenda of our next committee meeting .
Madam President , I should like to speak in support of this motion .
There do not seem to be any objections .
( Parliament gave its assent )
General product safety - BSE tests
The next item is the Commission statement on general product safety .
The idea behind the directive is in fact quite simple .
The report on the main findings will be circulated in parallel to the draft revision of the directive .
We first wish to clarify the scope of the directive .
This directive is meant to provide consistent assurances of the safety of products for consumers .
However , it does not apply where a specific sector of legislation covers the same aspects under consideration .
We want to make sure that the directive gives the best coverage possible to products used by consumers .
Two examples of that would be hair-dryers in a hair salon or equipment in a gym centre .
We want to have a more efficient system .
This implies , therefore , additional obligations for producers and distributors to provide information .
This is probably the most important element in this amended set of provisions .
The present situation is in fact far from ideal .
This notification is compulsory in the United States but not so far in the European Union .
This particular provision is designed to rectify that situation .
I also want a reinforcement of the market surveillance by Member States .
As you know , there is no good law if it is not applied properly .
Member States now will be required to strengthen the tasks of the surveillance authorities .
The practical operation of the system will be improved .
We now also foresee the possibility of opening the system to third countries , in particular candidate countries .
Another point to which I wish to draw your attention is improved transparency .
Consumers often lack confidence because they do not know what is happening .
Is there to be a regular process of dialogue in which they will be involved ?
Flammable furniture would be a case I have in mind .
Thank you , Mr Whitehead for those words of support which I greatly welcome .
Issues such as this particular provision will also be the focus of our attention .
Would you be in favour of establishing a forum of this kind ?
So I can assure you , Mrs Auroi , that I am concerned about these issues .
I take that responsibility seriously and we will be moving along in this way .
Has this been agreed with the trade unions and employers ' federations ?
That is not to say that the considerations that you draw attention to should be ignored .
Why not start by changing our agricultural policy so that it inspires complete confidence in consumers ?
We know that meat production begins in the stall .
The talk at present is of a total declaration of feedingstuffs .
I would like to ask the Commissioner a specific question about the rapid alert system .
Is the Commissioner able to provide assurances that these new proposals will overcome this problem ?
The tests offer new opportunities to test a large number of animals on a routine basis .
I commend these proposals to Parliament which have been put through the Commission this afternoon .
I have quite a few questions .
Parliament has been calling for the BSE test to be made compulsory since the BSE control committee .
It may very well be that it can happen in a shorter space of time .
I have a second question for you .
My second point , Commissioner , regards application in 2001 .
Control would then be much tighter in the production sector , thus benefiting the consumer .
We know that there is a proposal there already and that will now be fast-tracked .
So all these factors must be looked at together .
Will these tests also be carried out in Austria ?
Yes , these tests will be carried out in every Member State , including Austria .
You , Mr Whitehead , are particularly familiar with these .
But I regret I am not in a position to read the mind of the SVC .
That has tended to concentrate minds very considerably .
Surely it is better to take them out of the food chain ?
My understanding is that those animals are normally taken out of the food chain .
The findings of the report make extremely alarming reading .
This must be an issue of great concern to the Commissioner .
I would like to know what the Commission is doing about this .
Could I therefore ask Mr Byrne what he is doing about this report ?
I am satisfied that the French authorities have taken action .
Aeroplane " hushkits
The next item is the joint debate on two oral questions to the Commission by the following Members :
Mr President , I look forward with great interest to the Commissioner ' s reply to this debate .
This is , of course , a difficult issue to discuss sensibly in a United States election year .
We can understand that American politicians have little room for manoeuvre .
Or would they ?
As is clear , the regulation was adopted in order to protect the environment and the public .
I have no doubt that aside from being lengthy , those talks were also difficult .
Our position , then , is as follows :
If good faith prevails , that agreement can become a reality .
Mr President , I want to conclude with two respective observations .
The first is this : it must be made clear who is negotiating on the US side .
It is now a powerful body .
That is all we know for sure .
From then on we will have to see how we can carry on negotiating with the United States .
This regulation has no further intention , but I believe we need to be more ambitious .
The current standards , as Mr Blokland has reminded us , date from 1978 .
Since then , world aeronautical technology has made great advances .
What can we negotiate ?
We can negotiate two things :
I have negotiated with many people from the United States administration .
I have kept you informed promptly and with complete transparency throughout all this time .
I hope that , between us all , we can reach this agreement .
There is much ado about a great deal .
That is the only reason .
I welcome that and I congratulate you .
That is the part which is due to enter into force in April 2002 .
I am not prepared to consider a suspension without the conditions which I have just formulated .
I think that is a particularly sorry state of affairs .
That much is clear .
They have not given us their commitment , that is what makes us so suspicious .
They have given it to us so often .
We should not turn things round .
Yesterday we had a talk with the American Minister for Transport .
It is not acceptable for them to ask us to defer our own regulations .
Their future commitment depends on whether or not we are willing to defer .
The complaint they have filed with the ICAO is in fact uncalled-for blackmail .
I believe they should withdraw it .
Mr Hatzidakis has said that it should be withdrawn and you have said that we should defer .
I have tabled an amendment to the effect that they should definitely withdraw the complaint .
I think we need to word what we currently have on paper a little more strongly .
Consider the example of genetically modified organisms .
If we want to maintain our sovereignty , we must do so in every area , including this one .
I wonder if we should abolish this regulation as far as third country aircraft are concerned .
It has not even entered into force .
It is on the statute books but will not enter into force until May 2002 .
Why should we abolish it ?
I think that we should begin with a legislative procedure at the end of the year .
This was also what my fellow member was asking .
On that basis , Madam Vice-President , you continue to have our full support .
Stand by your guns , Madam Vice-President !
But having said that , it is important to get each trade dispute in proportion .
I say this knowing full well the massive pressures there are upon Congress in an election year .
The Commissioner and others have outlined the basis of possible discussions .
Mrs Roth-Berendt has mentioned a target with which I will concur .
Mr President , I strongly support the resolutions that are on the table before us .
It should be quite possible and right to go beyond them .
We need to be looking towards a new policy architecture to deal with all these questions .
It was voted through the last Parliament without any debate .
It is contrary to the principle of non-discrimination .
Above all , it should serve as well as possible the important environmental objectives it purports to achieve .
There are no grounds for suspending regulations .
Only under these circumstances could we accept a delay in our regulation for third countries .
Mr President , the British delegate has just spoken using Mr Bowe ' s speaking time .
There are regulations , we put them in place .
I was here at the first reading in the Parliament in Strasbourg .
They are good regulations .
That does not mean though that you should not negotiate .
Your objective , Madame Palacio , is to get that world-wide effect .
That is the mandate we are giving you here today .
That is what we would like to see you come back with at some time in the future .
Suggest that to them , Madame Palacio .
Start the negotiations and then come back to us with a reasonable compromise .
We must go further .
There is nothing more to say about this .
The regulation comes into force for European airlines on 4 May .
That is all . Thank you very much , Mr President .
That concludes the joint debate .
The vote will be taken tomorrow .

Fiori , on behalf of the PPE / DE Group , to the Commission ( B5-0213 / 2000 ) ;
The first is a general consideration .
This is a general political concern .
The second point is more specific .
This means that the pillars which were the basis for Barcelona must be adopted and perhaps even reinforced .
And this is a weak point .
We agree to support the civil forum .
I hope I have been clear .
We feel very strongly about this issue .
And yet much remains to be done in order to relaunch the three cooperation chapters decided upon in Barcelona .
This is extremely important , for the mutual benefits are very great .
Therefore , Mr President , much work still remains to be done .
Mr President , this is a decisive moment for the future of the European Union .
The Partnership is still far from achieving its objectives .
By what means is the Commission going to make the MEDA programme more efficient ?
Mr President , on behalf of my colleague , Chris Patten , I have the following comments .
It should be as meaningful and far-reaching as possible .
I also want to see an enhanced human rights dimension in the partnership .
All programmes contain conditionalities ensuring that their social impact is taken into account .
The implementation of MEDA has been subject to criticism , some justified , some not .
I count on the Parliament to support our efforts .
We shall use MEDA to support the partners ' efforts in this respect .
Regional cooperation to ensure that the region presents a unified market is also vital .
Regional infrastructure is essential to economic development .
Support for civil society is key to the development of the human dimension of the partnership .
For some reason or other , these agreements have not been implemented .
This assessment certainly includes some positive aspects .
Firstly , there has been no decisive political thrust when we really needed it .
On the other hand , there is no certainty whatsoever when it comes to the future of the Mediterranean .
Thank you very much , Mr Obiols .
I have allowed you the extra minute since you are chairman of the Maghreb delegation .
The situation of the rule of law and human rights in this country is scandalous .
Who is entitled to travel and to make use of the Mediterranean area ?
Not the opponents of the regime .
It is not enough to have a healthy economic balance sheet .
It is not enough to achieve good results in agriculture or anything else .
Mr President , the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership launched in 1995 has broken down . It is official .
Let me say from the outset that the time has come to change the course of Euro-Mediterranean policy .
There are considerable infrastructure needs , not to mention environmental challenges .
There are , however , advantages to establishing things from scratch .
The credibility of European foreign policy is at stake here .
I think the inclusion of Libya is crucial .
This will certainly be in the interest of both sides .
I hope that this Parliament will support it .
I believe furthermore that the Commission must have sufficient human and material resources to do so .
The second issue which concerns me is the inclusion of immigration in the regulation .
I am concerned about how this issue will be dealt with in the Mediterranean area .
The Mediterranean and its peoples need us .
We cannot leave them to struggle alone .
The regulation must be amended and Commission staff must be increased .
This must be increased , decentralised cooperation must be stimulated and the participation of civilian societies must be utilised .
Secondly , this programme does not focus solely on economic matters and free trade .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Secondly , in my opinion , there is a lack of generosity .
We see this in the Middle East vis-à-vis the USA and on a broader scale , too .
This visit has been an exceptional demonstration of the understanding that can be achieved between all parties .
This approach is supposed to be global and regional and treats the Mediterranean Basin as a regional entity .
So , as I pointed out , the Union ' s Mediterranean policy is supposed to be global .
The European Parliament is , in fact , only consulted on the occasion of bilateral agreements .
Well , four months later , we are in a vacuum .
We still have no date for a start to negotiations .
European Union actions are still very diffuse and complex in this area .
Mr President , I did not want to speak earlier in order not to interfere in the debate .
Once we take our places , all MEPs are equal and all of us have to respect the Rules .
I have received 6 motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 42 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
High Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration
We cannot criminalise immigration , whether it is for economic or political reasons .
We cannot herald good intentions and then fail to put them into practice because of a lack of funding .
I believe this is important and I would like an answer from the Council .
Secondly , I would like to say that we have mixed feelings with regard to these action plans .
This may also be the case with the Balkan countries , where it is clear who our partners are .
This would be absolutely incredible or , at least , very naive .
Furthermore , it seems to me that broaching this issue with these countries is difficult and dangerous .
There is a third problem : how are we going to pay for them ?
I believe this warrants some reflection .
Finally , the development of action plans is on the ' scoreboard ' .
I would like too to pay tribute to the work that the Commission has done in this area .
It is important that we approach this debate with a very clear distinction between asylum and illegal immigration .
In particular it looks at immigration and at the inadequacy of current data .
These are the things our Member States should be doing .
This is not the only problem , however .
Let us look at the situation in Iraq .
Whom should we urge to respect human rights ?
The way in which the High Level Working Group was set up and operates also gives cause for criticism .
This modus operandi is unacceptable .
Why does the European Union need a common asylum policy ?
Such accords have two potential advantages it seems to me over Community action .
Now , how can this possibly be ?
His precept surely holds true among nations as it does among individuals .
Their opinion has not been sought or has not been taken into consideration .
I am going to talk about asylum .
This clause is a violation of international law .
Just how can we agree to making development aid conditional upon the signature of such agreements ?
Europe must cease to turn a blind eye .
This means cancelling the debt of developing countries .
The only solution must be a brokered peace .
It could be that the European Union , with its historical links , could act as that intermediary .
My colleague , Anna Terrón , has said that this report is naïve .
The report says that there is no end to the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka .
Nothing else matters .
Nothing else will solve the problems or lessen the human rights abuses .
Nothing else will stop people from fleeing the country .
Clearly this is not an easy task .
The Commission stresses that it will play an active part in maintaining that balance .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
2001 budgetary guidelines
Parliament sets particular store by this .
We shall monitor these objectives closely during the reform process .
The European Parliament also stands by these commitments .
In other words , the Council recognises these demands and these commitments .
However , we expect the Council to set itself these new challenges and to act accordingly .
Allow me to make myself quite clear .
Histrionics do not help , they merely create unnecessary fronts .
What we need in order to finance the measures referred to is flexibility .
Without flexibility we will get nowhere .
I therefore call on the Council to stop adding fuel to the fire .
Do not commit yourself to a blockade attitude towards the review .
We want to support these aspects in the coming budget and concentrate our efforts on these areas .
First , and this applies to all the budgets , budgetary rigour .
What are the challenges of Activity Based Budgeting ?
This gives rise to a second thought which we must consider .
How can we work together with other institutions in the area of personnel recruitment ?
This includes preliminary scientific work , I should like to be quite clear on that .
We are dealing with a Commission which has a joint research centre .
As far as the other institutions are concerned , I only have a few comments to make .
There is potential for collaboration here .
We shall have to monitor the Court of Justice very closely .
So I treat this as a beginning and not an end .
That is the view of this Parliament .
In this way we are sending out a clear political message .
The substance of the Treaty must be implemented .
This , for us , is the crucial approach .
Let there be investment , then , in a culture of initiative .
Mr President , I would like to start off by congratulating Mr Ferber on excellent guidelines .
I welcome the clear orientation of the report to planning for enlargement .
The drive towards efficiency is especially vital in the context of enlargement .
We do not want a Lego approach to enlargement .
This is especially important in relation to linguistic support .
Any changes have to be clearly justified and transparent .
I wish them both luck in the task facing them .
Only the vital areas can receive public funding .
They will emphasise the importance of personal responsibility , diminish the bureaucratic load and enhance efficiency .
But the reforms will require cooperation with the staff .
That is why we have to prepare carefully for the forthcoming talks regarding the reform of staff regulations .
Mrs Haug ' s report stresses the importance of culture as a means of creating jobs .
Culture as such falls within the competence of the Member States .
However , culture as a means of livelihood is an area which is rapidly growing in importance .
Mrs Haug is not to blame .
And so I welcome the reinsertion of this item in the budget as a major step .
We cannot go on like this .
There is another important point in this budget .
It concerns civil dialogue .
Healthy growth and low unemployment are what we all want .
That would be cheap and it would not be right .
How can we stand up to the Committee on Budgets ' demand for rigour in these circumstances ?
Later we will need the commensurate funds .
Thank you very much , Mrs Langenhagen .
I congratulate you on being able to express yourself in less than the time allotted to you .
Unfortunately , others do not tend to follow suit .
We must not upset the farmers too much in this European Union .
This division of tasks is unacceptable .
In future , excavators will be rattling past , not tanks .
You must be able to reconstruct and we want to help you .
That cannot be .
We have stretched out our hand .
Mrs Haug has stretched out her hand .
She has said that we are prepared to work openly with the Council and the Commission .
We can work together .
You should know that .
Take the outstretched hand .
It is the financial situation which dictates future development .
Fighting unemployment through economic growth is the greatest challenge facing Europe .
The Lisbon Summit announced the direction to be taken up to the year 2010 .
We must therefore expect future intergovernmental conferences to substantiate how this is to be done .
The Berlin resolutions set out agricultural policy up to the year 2006 .
Farmers and politicians fought hard for this position .
This is a policy based on rough estimates and founded on pure observation .
Of course , the Balkans must be reconstructed but , overall , in a spirit of social solidarity .
Then , and I am convinced of this , the farmers and cooperatives will also make their contribution .
It therefore constitutes an extremely dangerous precedent as far as our farmers are concerned .
We therefore reject it .
We have therefore introduced an amendment to cover this .
The Internet is a tool , not a magic wand .
We are working on assumptions when we present this report from Mrs Haug .
I am just referring to the Haug report not to Mr Ferber ' s .
The trouble with the Council is that everything revolves around what was agreed at Berlin .
We keep being told that Berlin is set in concrete .
The members of Lutte Ouvrière will therefore be voting against the Haug report .
Today , the Council , Parliament and the Commission are bound by a signed commitment .
This is a very serious commitment .
If we have to finance new policies , we have to find new funding .
Providing the quantities and quality needed therefore represents a real challenge .
Commissioner Byrne quite rightly said that , as far as he was concerned , public health took priority .
This morning we discussed environmental protection .
Then it was said that environmental protection took priority .
I think we should find an objective procedure which safeguards new jobs .
I think that also represents an opportunity in relation to the enlargement of the EU .
We must endeavour above all to include small enterprises .
That is an important function and social dialogue is needed here .
I would be pleased to see new initiatives in this area .
Nevertheless , we do have a fall in incomes .
The sooner the Commission can propose to us clear figures for year-by-year spending the better .
What do we want , what objectives do we want to achieve or support with this budget ?
I think that this paves the way for bringing the budgetary procedure to a successful conclusion .
I should like in particular to thank the two rapporteurs on behalf of the Commission .
The report suggests that the other institutions will also gradually follow this lead .
Mr Ferber , you referred in your report to other problems which need to be resolved .
I would like to single out the question of financing for political parties .
Now to Mrs Haug ' s report .
It was also the central theme of today ' s debate .
It has been pointed out on several sides that demands are being made on the Commission .
You demanded this of the Commission and the Council in your resolution of 16 December .
My colleague , Chris Patten , took on this task together with Mr Nielson .
Allow me to say a few words on the overall increase in the size of the budget .
We have already had the opportunity to debate this twice in the Committee on Budgets .
I should perhaps come back to the budgetary procedure for the budgetary year 2000 .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Combating child sex tourism
The motion for a resolution which has been tabled takes account of this fact .
It no longer has a selective , national or European dimension .
The motion for a resolution therefore contains two central demands .
Secondly : account must be taken of the principle of extraterritorial jurisdiction .
Europe must take responsibility for its citizens , even beyond its borders .
Each of us knows of cases of child abuse in our own country .
The European Parliament flatly rejects this regulation on possible exceptions .
The role of NGOs is particularly important in this context .
The freedoms and rights of citizens include freedom from physical and mental harm .
This applies not only to our children but to all children .
It is our duty to implement this with all the means at our disposal .
Everyone involved agreed on this consensus .
This is also an explanation of the fact that numerous proposed amendments were rejected by my group .
They are already contained in the report , even if some are formulated differently .
I am convinced that this is a good , sensible resolution which will allow us to protect children .
Child sex tourism does not take place only in Europe , but throughout the world .
It is important to clarify the legal situation and to dispense with the notion of dual criminality .
The law of the offenders ' country of origin must be binding for the purposes of criminal prosecution .
This problem cannot be solved through national measures .
This protection must be guaranteed in both theory and practice .
It is about touching people ' s consciences .
They are innocent and defenceless and they seek security .
We must awaken citizens ' consciences where our children are concerned .
I also want to talk about the sexual dimension to life .
We must awaken citizens ' consciences regarding the place of love in our lives .
It is not only excellent in quality but also extremely useful .
We must tackle a dreadful scourge , the sexual exploitation of children .
This horrendous phenomenon occurs principally in third countries where there is great poverty .
We might remember the old Japanese proverb which says , ' The traveller knows no shame ' .
Some people have no qualms about doing in another country what they would not do at home .
It is very hard to locate these children and to extract them from a life of prostitution .
There must be criminal penalties for child abusers .
I suggest that we adopt this age limit and say that all minors must absolutely be protected .
Secondly , this report makes a contribution to police and judicial cooperation in the European Union .
This is a strong example where those Euro-sceptics who resist cooperation in this field are wrong .
There is an urgent need for a coherent policy for the protection of children to be implemented .
I wish to point out that Parliament has already adopted resolutions on this subject .
It must be noted that the proposals made have only been implemented in part .
Much more effective measures are required .
Finally , I must alert the House to the latest developments .
It is an extremely serious problem .
A separate vote means that some parts of the text may be removed .
I find that cause for extremely serious concern .
There are some extremely serious situations within the European Union as well .
We should look towards the good example set by Sweden .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Liability for defective products
It is an honour and a pleasure to have the opportunity to present this report to Parliament today .
This is a very good idea .
It helps to spread the risks of injury widely and ensure compensation .
Of course , it does not in itself ensure product safety .
We need more and deeper study for that purpose .
I would not myself like to leave it at that .
I do not think it should be prejudged .
Do we want to mimic the Americans in our liability law ?
How can we formulate a liability law which promotes rather than hinders innovation ?
We would like you to evaluate the reports which you receive impartially .
Companies must assume liability for damage to consumers without fault .
Caution and level-headedness are needed .
Millions of cases are affected day after day .
We wish the Commission every success in evaluating the results of the Green Paper .
This applies in particular in the case of foodstuffs and medication .
We do not want to see the consumer alone bear the risks inherent in technical progress .
In my view , applying the directive solely to private use and consumption is a questionable move .
The Commission should consider if the directive should not be extended to commercial goods .
And the smaller the enterprise , the heavier the burden of this unequal treatment .
We also need to think about the way in which liability is statute-barred .
We could perhaps consider gearing the limitation period to the type of product .
Which is why we have been elected .
It would be dangerous to stifle this by uniformity .
Research seems to show that our traditions are tending to converge slowly .
There is not a great deal of evidence that consumers are at the moment being seriously disadvantaged .
I would argue quite strongly that we have achieved a very fair and reasonable balance of interests .
Consumers will be the ones to lose out , if a flow of competitive and innovative products is stifled .
This Green Paper represents a first step towards this review .
The second principle consists of removing the burden of proof from the party that has suffered the damage .
The third principle concerns setting levels of compensation .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The directive which is currently being prepared should , in my opinion , have two objectives .
We have many reasons to move in this direction .
Firstly , the protection of the environment , but also the creation of jobs .
What must the cornerstones of this forthcoming directive be ?
As regards the instruments to be implemented , my report advocates subsidiarity .
I believe it is too early to pass judgement on the various instruments that can be classified .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent piece of work .
But , on balance , everyone is in favour .
Everyone says yes , we need these new sources of energy .
They are a fundamental component of the 21st century , of the 21st century way of thinking .
The second point is that we tend to polarise , and that causes problems .
All we are doing is fanning the flames of enmity .
That enemy is our ignorance of the fantastic opportunities which they offer us .
First , there are ecological advantages and , secondly , there are job opportunities .
We must recognise that .
We need a much higher proportion of primary energy used .
We have already come a long way , but not far enough by a long chalk .
We are represented in accordance with the subject matter !
For example , elevating the feed-in system to a universal panacea is wrong .
We must make a distinction between these causes .
It is too early to see one system as a universal panacea and dismiss another .
Secondly , the report also contradicts the Treaty at certain points .
This applies in particular to the statements on aid policy .
That is quite right and it complies with the Treaty .
My third comment also concerns a point at which the resolution does not comply with the Treaty .
We here in the European Union cannot impose mandatory obligations on the Member States .
More importantly , I cannot agree when there is talk of the curse of the lowest bidder .
Statements like this show disdain for the consumer and disregard the principle of supply and demand .
That is why , Madam Vice-President , I have three recommendations to make to the Commission .
The distinction is easy to make .
They need permanent protection .
We certainly have no lack of reports .
So there is no shortage of reports and they have all been translated into every possible language .
We have decided that the share of renewable sources of energy should rise from 6 % to 12 % .
In any case , I am merely repeating the Commission ' s figures .
How can we do this ?
Biomass and hydroelectric power account for 95 % of renewable energy sources in the European Union .
Wind , solar energy , photovoltaic energy etc. only account for 5 % !
Secondly , aid must be degressive .
No one can be punished for failing to keep to the quotas .
We cannot enter into commitments willy-nilly and then fail to honour them .
It is perhaps an unpleasant thought , but it will not function otherwise .
Three points - firstly , the whole issue of a level playing field .
On targets , I very much side with Mr Linkohr .
Paragraph 22 of this report calls for the establishment of a European sustainable energy agency .
It should also encourage fair and non-discriminatory network access as its most important item .
I hope that the Commissioner will really take that point to heart .
Parliament recently voted to maintain and increase funding for the SAVE programme .
The creation of an internal market in electricity should provide consumers of electricity with real choice .
The introduction of an element of competition in any industry should lead to more favourable pricing for the consumer .
In addition to that , the report emphatically calls for the European imposition of an energy tax .
I am totally opposed to this approach and I reject this taxation .
Support for demonstration projects should be included in any directive .
Access to the grid system at fair prices is crucial .
I hope that the Commission will take note of these points .
I am sure that this was an oversight in the drafting of the text .
This aim is clearly visible in the Commission ' s preparatory act .
The report does contain many good ideas .
The recorded aim of the Commission with regard to the promotion of renewables obviously has to be supported .
We really do have to invest in research into energy sources .
All forms of electric power must have free access to the market .
The harmonisation of taxation and aid schemes is a different matter .
In this respect the certification of electricity is an idea to be supported .
The position with regard to peat cannot be determined according to the same standards as biogases , for example .
What can we do about it ?
My opinion is that we should start by differentiating between compensation and subsidies .
First , the sustainability of energy sources .
I also think that research and development in this area need greater support .
In this respect , Parliament ' s contribution is an extremely important element in this process .
This House has always been forthright in its support for active policies designed to promote renewable energies .
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my thanks to Mr Turmes for his work .
I must point out that Mr Turmes ' s report fully concurs with these views .
To conclude , Mr President , other speakers have mentioned repayment .
Mr Vidal-Quadras and Mr Valdivielso both mentioned this a while ago .
Support must be given to renewable energies .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
( The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m. )
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
I want to stress two points .
I have never said that .
Of course I am in favour of the enlargement of the European Union to the East .
Thank you , Mr Berthu .
Are there any further comments ?
He did not say that .
He simply said " of Greek citizens " , in other words people who are resident in Greece .
I say this because Mr Katiforis is not here and so that the Minutes can be corrected accordingly .
I remember that too .
That will be corrected .
( The Minutes were approved )
Madam President , this is not about the Minutes but about a point of order .
The question on quite a few people ' s lips is : what is to become of this report ?
Will it be made public ?
I understand that the chairmen of the groups have been able to have a look at the report .
I would like to ask you what you are intending to do with it .
It is standard procedure , Mr Staes .
After that has been done , the Court of Auditors will draw up its final report .
This is not a lack of transparency .
It is not up to me to do it .
Quite , Mr Wurtz .
The " Echelon " system
In certain clearly specified and truly exceptional cases , the interception of telecommunications may be justified under these conditions .
It is the responsibility of each Member State to send data to Europol .
Each national supervisory authority has an essential role to play in this area .
I must also speak briefly about the data protection rules within the Schengen Information System .
This system provides for an authority responsible for protecting personal data .
Finally , I must mention data protection within the Third Pillar .
These ideas are still being developed .
Mr President , the Commission has taken note of the recent debate with concern .
I will try to cover most of them .
Respect for human rights and the rule of law constitute the foundations of the European Union .
All Member States of the European Union are signatories of the Convention .
The specific competencies attributed to the Community are defined in the Treaty .
The Commission can only act within the limits of the powers conferred on it by the Treaty .
National security questions belong to the exclusive competence of the Member States .
Electronic communications play an increasingly important role in everyday life of European citizens .
A well-functioning electronic communications infrastructure has become crucial for our economies .
The current rules for intra-community trade are laid down in the so-called dual-use regulation .
The Commission hopes that the revision of dual-use regulation can be completed during the Portuguese presidency .
The introduction of such products is not without complexities .
Software whose source code is not open , leaves the user in uncertainty .
The possibility of built-in circumvention of encryption cannot be excluded .
Secondly , effective use of encryption requires a safe key management system .
Let me now turn to data protection .
The Commission has not been entirely satisfied with the transposition of the data protection Directives .
However , it is clear that technological possibilities to intercept electronic communications exist .
And there is no evidence to say that the available technologies are not used .
The UK legislation also foresees a special Parliamentary oversight committee .
The Commission has also sought clarification from the United States government .
In the past , a great many parliamentary questions have been simply ignored .
We must now calmly consider what measures are to be taken in order to protect the European economy effectively .
Who , I wonder , would call for a committee of inquiry ?
What is this committee supposed to find out ?
No , the time for investigations and debate is past . Now , we must act .
Just how difficult the situation is , you can see from two remarks made in the last three minutes .
So what is to be done , then ?
Do we want a committee of inquiry ?
Do we want a non-permanent committee ?
I was therefore of the opinion that it was too early for a committee of inquiry .
That is something , at least .
I have to say I am disappointed .
It is very effective in fencing , but I dislike it in politics .
We have since discovered that this system does exist , but we do not know exactly how it works .
I expected the Council Presidency to make a statement about that .
Is the British Government being open about it ?
Is it collaborating in the system or not ?
I think we have a right to know .
We have good reason to believe that Community law is being flouted in this case .
Especially when we know that certain Member States are probably collaborating in order to by-pass them .
I am really very worried .
We will not be doing that if we routinely wait for initiatives from the Council and the Commission .
Secondly , we said effective economic protection systems and encryption must be adopted .
Now we are told the same thing all over again , eighteen months later .
Are we going to pass another resolution in Strasbourg repeating the 1998 resolution ?
I honestly believe that it is now too late for that .
The United States now acknowledges the existence of the ' Echelon ' system .
Tongues are being loosened in certain Union governments .
The press is crammed full of details about this all-pervasive electronic monitoring network .
And yet , how embarrassed the Council and the Commission sounded !
What tangled comments they made to avoid answering our questions .
Where is this taking us ?
With friends like that , who needs enemies ?
Our fellow citizens have been alerted .
I think Parliament will increase its stature by taking up this case by a majority .
Madam President , I shall be very brief as I only have one minute .
Under the circumstances we are stunned by the Council ' s statement .
We thought Mr Haider ' s Austria was endangering our freedom .
So , Madam President , are you still prepared to go to London ?
Will you ever go to Sydney again ?
Will you ever go to Ottawa or Wellington again ?
And we thought there was solidarity in Europe .
But stronger than whom ?
Stronger in opposition to Iraq ?
In opposition to the Serbs ?
Stronger in opposition to nations and nationalism ?
It is an ethnic group with a religious base , the holy alliance of Adam Smith and Calvin .
Apologise to the people spied on , for all that evangelism ?
Poor old European Commission !
Poor old European Council of Ministers !
Poor old European Union !
We are conditioned by the circumstances of our birth .
As a UK Member of this Parliament I understand other Members ' concerns .
This morning , and in recent days in particular , we have read and heard a lot of allegations .
That is , after all , the nature of intelligence and military information work .
Everything is subject to close parliamentary scrutiny in the House of Commons .
I therefore have three questions .
Finally , how can we defend ourselves against this threat ?
This then provided us with the notorious Infopol documents .
How great is the damage which has already been caused to the European economy ?
Are there companies in addition to Thomson and the Airbus consortium which have sustained damage ?
I should like to quickly make the following points .
Mr Wiebenga said that I did not clearly and specifically condemn Echelon .
I did do so and I do so again .
We will keep Parliament constantly informed of developments in this respect .
President , can I first thank Parliament for the discussion .
Here , there have been programmes for eighteen months .
Mrs Berger asked whether some companies have been losing contracts because of espionage .
No companies have contacted the Commission on that issue .
I think this decision is very clear .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place during the next part-session .
Decision by the Patent Office on the cloning of human beings
On behalf of the Commission , I should like to say that the Commission shares these concerns .
The European Patent Office has issued a press statement to that effect .
You have a joint motion before you today which includes such charges .
Therefore the question is : what does the Commission intend to do about it ?
That is the reason why I am here today .
Some oppositions to this patent have already been filed .
Such a delay in correcting what is , in effect , an admitted error , is clearly undesirable .
This is a flagrant violation of human dignity .
We now see how important these clarifications were .
The European Patent Office has incorporated the European Union ' s directive into its own directives .
It must also meet with vigorous protest in the European Parliament .
It is a question of its needing to be applied better .
However , the question disappeared without trace in the course of this House ' s business .
Why do I mention this ?
Moreover , everyone must adhere to this .
Mr President , European Patent No EP 69 53 51 has been a great shock to us .
This patent is no isolated case , however .
We must vehemently oppose this commercialisation of human genes and these flagrant violations of human dignity .
In their defence the officers of the Patent Office refer to the language problem .
Each person is unique ; there is something sacred in each human being .
The Council should give the Commission the mandate to do this .
It is , after all , one of my own country ' s most distinguished universities .
Of course , I would like to add that that is something which is of serious concern .
I have no objection whatsoever to making that letter public .
I agree with him .
I think that the directive is a good one .
It was also mentioned by Frau Gebhardt that the cloning of human beings should be forbidden .
Well , President , it is forbidden .
May I draw the attention of Mrs Gebhardt to the fact that the directive specifically forbids that .
The last issue I should like to deal with is the matter of the Community patent .
Several speakers this morning have spoken about the European patents .
Now , a European patent is what the European Patent Office grants .
The proper term to use is a Community patent .
We are working on that .
That presents us with certain legal problems and we are trying to solve them .
It is indeed true that the language problems are considerable .
Mr President , I just wanted some further clarification .
Not so .
I would merely ask you to be aware of this .
That is a quite different statement from the one you attributed to me .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
( The sitting was suspended at 10.55 a.m. and resumed at 11.05 a.m. )
The Committee on Women ' s Rights and Equal Opportunities has tabled a special opinion .
A mistake has nonetheless crept into our opinion .
I do not want there to be a mistake here , even if we are not voting on it .
The Committee voted to remove this section , but it has nonetheless been included by mistake .

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Haug report ( A5-0070 / 2000 )
So it is with great pleasure that I have voted for paragraphs 21 and 34 .
Enlargement will be an expensive business in many ways .
In spite of this , enlargement is not mentioned in Mrs Haug ' s report .
All direct aid given to agricultural production ought to gradually be abolished .
The Committee on Fisheries does not want more money .
It is imperative that new priorities are given new financial resources .
We do not agree with this approach and therefore cannot approve the report .
Ferber report ( A5-0068 / 2000 )
There is too much staff-related expenditure .
Haug and Ferber reports ( A5-0070 and 0068 / 2000 )
Resolution on " hushkits " ( B5-0289 / 2000 )
This has to be accompanied by a progressive reduction in noise ascribable to aircraft .
The noise issue is equally topical in American airports .
That is stressed in the resolution .
The American industry exerts enormous pressure and the situation is distorted by the prospect of the elections .
But how can anyone defend such exemptions on the pretext that there is disagreement ?
Is the European Union really just there to serve the multinationals and big business ?
This is not a lot of fuss about nothing .
The Union should not be afraid of American threats and retaliatory measures .
Resolution on Mediterranean policy
So why do we forget the material , military and diplomatic support France has given those regimes ?
The partnership has failed to meet the expectations raised by the countries participating in the conference .
In fact , the latter must take action to achieve a cultural , social and human partnership .
There are still many social challenges to be faced .
The implementation of an economic partnership is especially vital for agriculture .
In fact , Member States are directly affected by this policy .
Hernández Mollar report ( A5-0057 / 2000 )
Why , then , are so many Members critical ?
Indeed , it is an absolutely indispensable aspect of the plans .
It makes no sense to want everything and its opposite at the same time .
Klamt report ( A5-0052 / 2000 )
The report is also a good text in that respect .
Of course , our institution as such is not responsible for this evil .
All the same , the coincidence is distressing .
That dignity must be defended and promoted for each and every one of us .
If dignity does not belong to everyone then it ceases to exist .
The European Commission has drawn up a report of the measures which have been taken in this field .
Exemplary penalties must be imposed on the people guilty of such monstrous behaviour .
That is intolerable !
We must not be blind to the fact that the Internet facilitates these ' practices ' .
The report rightly places this form of slavery in the general context of cross-border organised crime .
Faced with the exponential development of the latter on the Internet , Amendment No 2 is essential .
Amendment No 3 broadens the terms of this measure .
Mrs Klamt has presented a good report today .
Obviously , this form of ' tourism ' is a crime .
- I wholeheartedly support Ewa Klamt ' s report on the fight against child exploitation .
Technology is proceeding faster than individual governments can legislate .
Progress is , of course , being made .
But whilst I welcome the positive noises coming from Brussels , it is not enough .
That is too precious to become the plaything of wealthy , western tourists .
MacCormick report ( A5-0061 / 2000 )
How often do European pensioners receive their pensions on time ?
How often do widows and elderly people receive the correct allowance ?
The States are guilty of such offences and should be held liable .
Turmes report ( A5-0078 / 2000 )
We are still talking about mere thousandths of the overall requirement .
Nowadays , it is impossible to live without electricity .
Electricity is like the water we drink and the air we breathe .
Do we pay for the air we breathe ?
Resolution on the cloning of human beings
However , we were very divided when it came to the vote .
They did not succeed , but they have nonetheless weakened the resolution .
That is unfortunately not the case .
Contrary to what Parliament believes , this patent is no isolated case .
It is also nonsense and self-deluding to maintain that the directive on patenting would prohibit this .
In the end , we have voted as a unit against the resolution .
It is human dignity which provides the decisive standard .
- We have had a lengthy debate in this house on the patenting of biotechnology .
Genetic information can only be discovered , it cannot be invented .
The human genome and its sequences should not be patentable .
It bears no relation to genetic manipulation of people or embryos .
It is misleading to suggest that the object of this patent is to genetically manipulate humans .
The University of Edinburgh have indicated their willingness to cooperate with any suitable modification of the patent .
This is what the Edinburgh research is about .
Unfortunately , companies have already been developing and patenting cloning techniques .
A patent for these techniques has been granted in the UK since August of 1995 .
Scientific research is now doing more than explore and analyse the world , it is changing it .
Where will it end ?
Why should we put our trust in science alone in this new context ?
As elected representatives and citizens , we are outpaced by issues where the scientific component is too strong .
There is plenty of money at stake .
The debate about the moral boundaries of biotechnology and how to control them has begun .
That concludes the vote .
Adjournment of the session
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament .
( The sitting was closed at 12.40 p.m. )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 30 March 2000 .
The whole issue is a reflection on the inability of this House to act .
I would like to thank you for your forceful intervention .
Thank you , Mr Imbeni , for your extremely kind words .
I believe it was very important for this House .
Thank you , Mr Imbeni , for your comments .
Madam President , I should like to draw your attention to an internal matter .
In other parliaments ushers are treated with the respect that they deserve .
I would hope that happened in the European Parliament .
One can form one ' s own opinion and keep quiet .
The answer is in order to get used to lying in the soil .
These words were spoken by a Member of this House .
I refuse to believe that anyone here would keep calm if this joke was aimed at Jews or blacks .
I think that a reaction from yourself , Madam President , would be wholly appropriate .
I can only say that these remarks have shocked me deeply .
( Applause from the left )
The Member you have quoted is not here to answer you or to defend himself ...
( Mixed reactions )
These are big issues , and Parliament must address them seriously .
Finland is the only country whose television picture cannot be picked up in Parliament .
They now get two channels , and I hope that we Finns will now get at least one .
I have already complained about this on various occasions in parliamentary sittings .
Meanwhile you allow five million euros to be stolen !
Thank you , Mr Seppänen .
It is not just a little detail .
I am really sorry that he has not been handed that card .
I will attend to it this week .
I can assure you that the Quaestors are working on it .
Thank you , Mrs Banotti .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , considerable changes have been made to the proposed agenda .
Reports have been shifted around and time slots have even been changed .
Tomorrow we will start at 8.30 a.m. for the first time .
We are now faced with a dilemma .
I therefore wonder how we are to fulfil our obligations in the best way ?
You received an e-mail last week about our intention to apply for the quorum on Friday .
The Conference of Presidents has also received a letter on this matter .
In return , I promise that I shall raise the matter at the Conference of Presidents .
The Group leaders have heard your points .
In my opinion , the Bureau should rule that a report which has these characteristics is inadmissible .
Thank you , Mr Ribeiro , we shall look into your statement very carefully .
Football is a sport which transcends the world .
Almost every country plays football .
It is known as a beautiful game .
In about three months Belgium and Holland will play host to Euro 2000 .
Thank you , Mr Miller .
We shall do so .
This is a very sensible suggestion in my view .
Sittings in Strasbourg from 10 to 14 April 2000 :
Relating to Tuesday :
We of course regret this , but the fact remains .
We have no means to force the Council to make a statement .
Their proposal was to enter these items on the agenda instead of the statement on Iraq .
Let me turn now to Mr Hänsch .
Is this what you propose ?
So , Tuesday Turkey , Wednesday Ethiopia .
I would prefer it if we could hold the debate on Ethiopia when the Council is present .
Mr van Velzen , the Council is indeed in attendance on Wednesday , I am assured .
Mr Hänsch has just spoken in support of this request .
( Parliament gave its assent )
Relating to Wednesday :
Is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal ?
Yes , of course .
( Parliament gave its assent )
Relating to Thursday :
We shall then be able to withdraw our proposal under item I.
Unless you want us to proceed directly to the vote on replacing item IV ?
For goodness sake , let ' s vote on it !
Yes , I think that is clearer .
I would rather keep to the order in which the proposals were received .
( Parliament gave its assent )
Who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal ?
The originators of the proposal seem to be happy to agree to that .
Thank you for that .
There is therefore no need to vote on this proposal since it has been withdrawn .
It is up to the House to decide .
I think we are all in agreement .
So , I have the proposal regarding Zimbabwe .
The proposal for an item on the Ethiopian famine has been withdrawn .
Who is in favour of entering Zimbabwe as the fifth sub-item in the Human Rights section ?
( Parliament gave its assent ) Relating to Friday :
Is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of or against this proposal ?
I therefore ask that a resolution be taken in connection with the oral question .
Do you mean after the oral question on the storms ?
I do not think that would be a problem .
( Parliament gave its assent )
Sittings in Brussels on 3 and 4 May : no amendments .
( The order of business was adopted thus amended )
Child pornography on the Internet
There are very few regulations which are concerned with what the Internet is used for .
My report , for the first time , puts forward a definition .
We have been short of a definition until now .
We can only deal with this matter if we deal with it in an international fashion .
If we are lucky , we will see a world approach to outlaw these very bad practices .
We want to stamp out this appalling abuse .
We have tried to reach a compromise in our deliberations .
I believe that we have managed to do so .
We have had nothing but positive contributions .
In my own committee this report was adopted with 27 votes in favour and one abstention .
That I regard as very helpful and a good sign for the future .
Madam President , child pornography is a loathsome form of crime .
Measures at transnational level are required , especially due to the denationalised nature of the Internet .
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Kirkhope , for his most excellent report .
In this regard , it is perhaps particularly pleasing that it is from Great Britain that Mr Kirkhope comes .
This will hopefully lead to better investigations .
Europol will be involved , as will the candidate countries .
All children should have the right to a childhood !
That ought to be a basic human right .
This obligation must have legal implications .
The importance of the Internet is obvious to us all .
It has come to be indispensable as a modern communication tool .
We need it for exchanging information , for learning and for all sorts of operations .
Parents are powerless in the face of this phenomenon because they cannot keep up with this technological progress .
Consequently , an urgent need has arisen to combat child pornography on the Internet effectively .
This is the key to prevention .
The attention that has been paid to this issue has increased considerably in all Member States .
These children are in particular need of society ' s protection .
The Internet itself cannot commit crimes .
95 to 97 % of the Internet is legal .
All the same , the Internet is not beyond the law .
I would like to congratulate Mr Kirkhope on his report . It is a high-quality text .
All the proposed measures are suitable and necessary to effectively combat child pornography .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank Mr Kirkhope for his excellent report .
What exactly needs to be done in order to combat child pornography effectively , especially on the Internet ?
First of all , we need to set up an easily accessible and recognisable contact point .
This is simply lacking .
Officials need to be trained well , otherwise they will be unable to combat child pornography effectively .
Lastly , the penalties must be harmonised in Europe and must be increased .
In fact , his name fills us with hope .
We are delighted that there is now a definition at long last .
After all , there is quite obviously a correlation between child pornography on the Internet and trafficking in children .
This correlation is also evident in the case of possibly kidnapped and missing children .
In order to conceal their own identity , they use the bank details of others .
In order to stamp out child pornography , we need a multi-disciplinary approach .
The police and criminal investigation services must be able to do their jobs well .
This means that the politicians need to ensure that the police can do its job effectively .
Politicians too should believe that child pornography exists on the Internet .
The NGOs are doing a great job .
Communication technologies transform data .
The Internet thus has formative and demultiplying effects on the trade and traffic in child pornography .
This trafficking is on a scale hitherto unknown in terms of its extent and the geographical areas covered .
The existence of these networks confirms the need for a common judicial area .
The common judicial area does exist with Europol , Schengen and Eurodac .
There is no problem identifying the parties involved in trafficking child pornography , who are often repeat offenders .
What is needed is prevention , in order to counter their activities and to dismantle their networks .
Interpol has acknowledged having a file of 800 photos .
Why are these valuable documents not used ?
Who are these children and what is being done to locate them ?
If there are records of offenders , it must be possible to keep records of victims .
To govern , however , means to make plans .
For example , in the area of trivialising homosexuality .
I am well aware that not all child pornography necessarily ...
I know , I am well aware of Mr Schulz ' s customary protests .
That , ladies and gentlemen , is what I wanted to say .
We therefore do not want a situation where you cannot see the wood for the trees .
The Internet , Minitel , the post are nothing more than the medium .
It is the originators we must combat .
Everyone knows perfectly well that that is not the case today .
( Applause and mixed reactions )
It was important for it to be subjected to as few rules as possible .
It has since become apparent that the Internet is merely a reflection of our society .
This is a good reason to take action against this as a Union .
I therefore welcome the Council ' s current proposal and Mr Kirkhope ' s report with open arms .
Another difficult point is the age limit up to which pornography is considered child pornography .
I myself am in favour of an age limit of 18 , rather than 16 , years .
This matter has preoccupied us for a long time , too long in my opinion .
Its importance is demonstrated by the constantly increasing incidence of such delinquency .
Pornographic material can be distributed via the Internet in unlimited amounts and by the most direct route .
We welcome the debate on the age limit .
Actions must follow .
This is the type of poison which he spouts here .
Then it all sounds so wonderful .
I think this is a worthy point which Mr Kirkhope should take into consideration in his report .
I also expressly support the view that we should not move away from criminal-law liability .
We cannot resolve it simply through Interpol and more stringent criminal law .
We should discuss this in at least as much detail as the tightening of criminal law .
The distribution of child pornography is facilitated by the Internet .
Not only is the scale of distribution magnified , but there is a risk of the offence being trivialised .
These are all points underlined by Mrs Plooij .
In actual fact , there is a great deal of resistance .
The Internet has the aura of progress .
I think that whoever wills the end must also will the means .
It is not divorce , alcoholism or anything else that encourages this behaviour .
The Internet makes exchanging pictures easier , and it is this we should be discussing .
It is , therefore , a shame that we are immediately about to call in Europol .
This is a problem .
For this is not only an issue within the EU .
It is not exclusively in Western Europe that this issue is being dealt with .
The problem with the Internet is that the pictures are so clear .
I therefore welcome this initiative , which was finally put forward so comprehensively by the Austrian Presidency .
My second point is the age limit .
It cannot be set high enough .
My third point is that we need experts in the fight against child pornography on the Internet .
Mr President , thank you for the well-reasoned proposal of the rapporteur !
The second point concerns telephones , because telephone calls can also be made anonymously .
As the Internet ignores national boundaries , those tracking down Internet crime must also be able to cross them .
International cooperation therefore has to be encouraged as much as possible .
The conference adopted conclusions and recommendations that are being actively followed up .
The Commission has long been concerned about child pornography on the Net .
The Council and Parliament adopted it on 25 January 1999 .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
European Refugee Fund
All refugees begin with a dream of returning home .
It is also of significant help to those who subsequently return home .
It may , in fact , prove to be a prerequisite of successful repatriation .
I do not , therefore , understand why some people want to distinguish between displaced persons and refugees .
It is not about relative numbers , but actual numbers .
In addition , there is , of course , some uncertainty about the fund ' s financial future .
I was very excited when I read the Commission ' s proposal .
The Commission is obviously on the right track .
It is important that the financial responsibility for refugees be distributed among Member States .
However , the Committee on Budgets is raising two objections .
Firstly , no consideration is given to the Financial Regulation .
Indeed , the programme is multiannual , whilst the financial calculations have only been made for one year .
The second objection is more extensive .
But a real European Refugee Fund will cost a great deal more than that .
The Commission is on the right track .
So the proposed review process becomes essential .
Asylum-seekers are not a burden but a responsibility .
Not to take such an approach would be short-sighted , as others have already pointed out .
We also want it to be a duty for the committee assisting the Commission to consult with other organisations .
The asylum policy urgently needs a European approach .
As Europeans , we do not want that sort of policy .
We most certainly do not want one country to shift its responsibility to another .
Setting up this fund is therefore a step in the right direction .
It provisionally brings the desired solidarity within the European Union symbolically into focus .
This is also the thrust of the amendment tabled by my Group .
Subsequently , the aid figures will need to correlate with the absolute numbers .
The tasks supported by the fund are covered in the proposal and by the rapporteur .
We are extremely pleased with the broad support for our concept of tailor-made solutions .
For them , it is important to optimise their chance of repatriation with dignity .
In this respect , Amendment No 19 deals with refugees , while Amendment No 21 focuses on displaced persons .
We should really spell this out a little more clearly .
I am very curious to see whether this report will be published before long .
It could , in itself , contribute towards the common policy based on best practices .
This seems very bad policy on the part of the Netherlands .
Mr President , my Group welcomes this proposal .
Mass refugee situations require special measures and separate budgetary allocations .
Only in this way can routine long-term measures also be maintained .
I agree .
We saw the need during the war in Kosovo .
They would have much preferred this than to have been sent thousands of kilometres away to distant countries .
The report shows the extent to which parliamentary activity can be beneficial to Europe .
We therefore support these motions .
We shall here mention only three points .
These are huge tasks requiring amounts far greater than those initially planned .
I also do not support your proposals for measures which are incompatible with the particular groups .
That contradicts the basic intention .
Please do so in implementing the measures which are necessary and positive .
Furthermore , her report expresses this Parliament ' s pleasure .
For us , the establishment of this Fund is good news .
Those are three different areas of work .
The Member States have a major role to play in this respect and must make considerable efforts .
We must develop policies which are coherent with both funds .
Financing must be ensured up to 2004 .
So far , the balance sheet has not made any clear statement for the period after 2001 .
This proposal raises many questions .
Are Member States themselves no longer capable of managing the refugees they receive in normal circumstances ?
Will some countries be net contributors and others , net recipients , and if so , which ?
The answers to these questions cannot be found anywhere in the reports passed on to us .
Once again we are being asked to take an important decision while being kept in the dark .
This is a pernicious effect which insurers are familiar with .
The two situations are quite different and require different responses .
To confuse them would be to give way to populist rhetoric .
We are setting up a European Refugee Fund for an initial period of five years .
This is , I feel , an initial step in the right direction .
A practical solution must be found , and I have to tell you that that is no easy matter .
In this respect , it provides an initial response to the request made by the European Council in Tampere .
The competent national administrations are by no means familiar with these procedures .
The Fund is intended to contribute to balancing Member State efforts .
These modest enough resources should not be watered down further by the inclusion of secondary objectives .
Thank you very much , Mr Vitorino .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Electronic money institutions and credit institutions
The common position reflects a compromise that has been reached after long negotiations in the Council .
That would mean that the situation would remain uncertain from the consumers ' point of view .
They are all the amendments proposed by the ECB which were unanimously rejected by the Council .
Amendments Nos 1 and 2 add the words " at par value " to the report .
These additional words are not absolutely necessary as Article 3 sets out the terms for redeemability .
In this latter case the additional words would add nothing and be misleading to the consumer .
All these cases are also subject to a maximum storage amount of no more than EUR 150 .
In addition , the waived schemes will not benefit from the Single Market passport provisions .
Waived institutions would therefore always be registered and monitored by the supervisory authorities .
Amendments Nos 3 , 4 and 5 reduce the scope of the waiver .
The Commission took a similar view .
We therefore welcome the directive .
We also welcome the fact that there are no exemptions to the change-back obligation .
What are we talking about here ?
What effects will these comprehensive exemption provisions have on currency stability ?
We will monitor this .
This must change !
We need electronic money which is valid in a given environment .
For this reason , it must cover the entire European area and not just a national area .
However , I am thinking primarily of consumers .
For this reason I cannot support the new wording of Article 8c .
That is very regrettable .
It is important that consumers are reassured in relation to electronic payments by establishing a legal framework .
This does not make sense .
I welcome the directive on cross-border credit transfers which is now in force within the Union .
It is also good news for financial institutions .
Be in no doubt about that , this legislation would fall .
It seems to me that is a perfectly reasonable position .
May I add that schemes which benefit from any waiver will not benefit from the European passport .
Therefore , the justification for their deletion on the basis of monetary policy concerns is unfounded .
They continue to report to the competent authorities on a periodic basis .
In other words , in the whole process not an iota of money is created .
E-money does not mean that money is created .
Therefore I should like to lay these apprehensions to rest .
There is no possibility that monetary instability will arise from the phenomenon of e-money .
We want those rules .
Regrettably , therefore , I cannot accept Amendments Nos 3 or 4 .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Animal nutrition inspections
This is most certainly the case for all legislation related to food safety , either directly or indirectly .
There are ample examples to prove this .
Scandals can have a cleansing effect .
On 15 November last , the Council laid down the present common position .
This legislation offers us various procedures for transferring the powers of the Council to the Commission .
I am of the opinion that we should give the Commission the opportunity to act swiftly .
We should all bear in mind that this dossier is only an intermediate step .
It immediately drew lessons from the dioxin crisis .
We should join forces with the Commission against the Council and move towards a conciliation procedure .
The rapporteur , Mr Staes , has mentioned some here .
Who is protecting us and who is providing the safeguards ?
The original Commission proposal has thus been readopted by us .
We consider that it is absolutely imperative that in urgent cases we can act rapidly .
The Commission must be given the necessary powers here as guardian of the treaties .
Too many committees cause delays and , ultimately , confusion .
We must use the existing facilities and use them efficiently .
Europe and the internal market can only exist if they are also accepted by the citizens and the consumers .
I listened to him and hope that what he said is right .
Such is life !
It would be nice if he could be made aware of this , but that is probably unlikely .
And what has the Council learnt from this ?
It was not this Parliament , and only to a very minor extent the Commission .
It was the Council of Ministers who tried repeatedly to keep things under wraps .
So what has it learnt from the BSE crisis ?
Has it learnt that it is better to be transparent ?
Has it learnt that it is better to permit safeguard options and safeguard clauses ?
Has it learnt that rapid action is needed ?
It has learnt none of these things !
It will not have the option to get involved quickly and unbureaucratically on the basis of safeguard clauses .
It will also not have the option to make unannounced on-the-spot inspections .
It is better to leave things in the hands of the Agriculture Ministers .
Animals are just the first link in the chain which leads ultimately to human beings .
But our impression is that the Council does not see this .
I particularly appreciate the good collaboration with Parliament in this case .
Already at first reading , Parliament fully supported the Commission 's proposal .
The proposal aims at improving control measures in the field of animal nutrition .
It intends to harmonise inspection procedures for all products imported from third countries .
The discussion in the present case constitutes an important precedent for the future .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon .
Food additives other than colours and sweeteners
When I say ' more and more ' , you only have to look at the figures .
A survey of the current situation shows that 307 additives are authorised within the European Union .
We are effectively working with a positive list .
I am thinking in particular of the problem of allergies .
What is being proposed today ?
I shall mention them quickly .
This is quite clear , just from reading the relevant literature .
It is not , therefore , necessarily to be recommended .
There is another additive which presents a huge problem , E467 .
We must consequently reject this one too .
Finally , three other additives are proposed as propellants .
These are inflammable gases - butane , isobutane and propane .
That is a brief overview of the problem .
As we are not absolutist , we consider that they may be accepted .
The Commission has announced a radical revision of the directive .
I have counted around fifty of these myself .
Others should be used far less widely .
Mr President , the way in which we feed ourselves is an expression of how we live .
Some people criticise what I would call the modern western lifestyle , rightly or wrongly .
The answer to this question is often determined by the choices we make .
As far as additives are concerned , the basic rules are enshrined in the 1989 Framework Directive .
To assess whether the use of additives is necessary , the Framework Directive lists various accepted objectives .
One of these is the supply of ingredients or components of foodstuffs to patients with dietary needs .
I would like to add the following if you will allow me .
Secondly , the effects on public health must obviously be assessed on a scientific basis .
For this purpose , we call on the Scientific Committee for Food for scientific opinions .
We cannot do a bit of both .
We have asked for a hierarchy of standards in the IGC report and we have also mentioned this elsewhere .
I think that Community policy in relation to the use of additives has developed in a quite irresponsible way .
Instead , I think the Commission needs seriously to rationalise the number of additives .
In my opinion , the quantities of these compounds that are permitted are way too excessive .
Nitrosamine is a carcinogenic substance which is derived from , and produced by , nitrates and nitrites .
It does not , however , mean deleting any additives from the list .
It does mean , however , that food safety must be at the top of the agenda .
Whilst many additives are harmless , this does not mean that they all are .
What consumer interest is served by doing this ?
Mr Lannoye has done an excellent job ; indeed , he has achieved what the Commission failed to .
I also fail to see what the Commission promised , i.e. transparency .
I would also like to once again stress what Mr Lannoye has said .
This report makes clear that we need a reform of additives .
It has nothing to do with competition that we reject what the Commission is proposing .
Industry will then have to decide the ones it wants .
That would at least be an innovative viewpoint which makes competition the basis .
It is also very unfortunate that the synergy effect has not been investigated .
Current liberalisation of the quantity of permitted additives is worrying .
Let us , therefore , have the list shortened as soon as possible rather than extended .
The additive I am thinking of in this regard is ethylhydroxyethylcellulose .
This substance is no luxury and it is not addictive .
The substance is , therefore , not completely exchangeable for other , already approved types of cellulose .
However , I maintain that in reality the opposite may be true .
These families cannot buy their bread , but have to make it themselves and add the binding agent themselves .
Why should we make life even more difficult for these families ?
Why should they not be allowed to continue to use the binding agent that they are used to using ?
In this case it is not possible to invoke the precautionary principle in order to ban the substance .
On the contrary , the precautionary principle favours the approval of ethylhydroxyethylcellulose .
Mr President , like everyone else in this debate I should like to congratulate Mr Lannoye .
I am prepared to accept that some of these are harmless .
Indeed , the committee and even Mr Lannoye were prepared to accept E949 and E650 .
These are apparently needed by manufacturers because they produce an equal spray of fat on the utensil concerned .
One of them is there only for professional use .
The other two are regarded as safe for all .
It does not seem to us to be the right place for it .
We would prefer to strike out recital 5 and we shall so vote .
But its meaning remains crystal clear .
At the end of the line it is for the consumer that this is being done .
It is being done in the consumer 's name .
For that reason we commend Amendment No 2 .
In this respect , the Lannoye report provides one more classic example .
Who stands to gain from the inclusion of additives , of chemicals , in our meals ?
On the one hand , do the additives meet a technological need ?
On the other hand , are the additives useful to the consumer ?
The question answers itself .
Finally , is it certain that the additive is harmless ?
That is the prime consideration .
I promise , Mr President , to be extremely brief .
Firstly , I have an initial comment to make on the Scientific Committees .
Occasionally , reading the reports gives rise to more doubts than certainties .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
( The sitting closed at 9.20 p.m. )
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Could the EPP Group please get its act together !
( Applause from the left )
He should be quite clear about that procedure within our Group .
Secondly , as he is aware , there is a process going on at the moment for reforming Parliament .
I should like that to be corrected .
It shall be done , Mrs McNally .
We agree on a great number of deadlines in the citizens ' interest .
Thank you for your understanding .
( The Minutes were approved )
Mr President , on a point of order .
( Applause from the right )
I will pass on your comments to the President , Mr Kirkhope .
Vote on request for urgent procedure
It is planned for our agenda in May .
We can leave this until next month .
( Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure )
1998 discharge , budgetary control
Parliament takes the control function assigned to it in the European Treaties seriously .
All the measures called for must be carried out by the deadline set .
All the cases are awaiting a decision .
Despite countless lofty announcements , there is as yet no real evidence of a fresh start .
Decentralisation must not result in the total de facto abolition of internal financial control .
You see , good old Goethe had the right words even in this situation .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we have a number of difficult decisions to take this week .
A good example of this , in my view , is the discharge for the Development Funds .
In the meantime , however , we have good news to impart .
I think that this development clearly demonstrates the direction that we need to take .
It took the Committee over 15 months to refer justified cases of suspicion of fraud to OLAF .
There is another problem with the Economic and Social Committee , the problem of buildings .
We are still paying rent for the Ardenne and Ravenstein buildings .
There are similar problems with the European Court of Justice .
We are also able to propose that the Dublin agency and the Thessaloniki agency be granted discharge .
However , we would like to see the contradictory procedure shortened for the agencies .
I should like to report quite unequivocally that neither applies .
There has been no whitewash .
Some were perhaps a little late in arriving , but they did all arrive .
That is another difference in the discharge procedures .
I should like to come now to the question of where the shortcomings which we must clear up lie .
This refers mainly to the fixtures and fittings in this building .
This direct contract procedure must not catch on and become the predominant procedure .
Another important point addressed relates to the question of buildings .
We have already discussed them at length .
We have received every document written on the subject .
The inventory has been addressed .
Mr Seppänen addressed it yesterday .
In the meantime , thank God , we have introduced an electronic inventory system in Parliament .
We are now waiting for an explanation as to how this electronic system functions .
I should like to come back to the question of yardsticks and results .
I hope I do not have to sit in such a Parliament .
We are pleased to note that this has meanwhile been rectified .
So what exactly were Parliament ' s requirements ?
This has since been done and we are grateful for this .
This is moving in the right direction .
This may also partly be due to the fact that agricultural policy has changed over the years .
Special attention should also be paid to the European revenue .
What does the Committee on Budgets mainly want ?
This is something which the Commission could undertake itself .
In this way , the various offices will benefit from a healthy rivalry .
I think it is about time this stopped .
The Committee on Budgets , therefore , recommends discharge .
We are expecting a report on this .
We can grant discharge to the Commission without these three elements .
There is something else .
Since 1995 , there has been a conciliation committee for agricultural expenditure .
The Commission has promised to assess this .
We have decided to give the discharge on three conditions , and the conditions are clearly spelt out .
We hope that by 15 August those concerned will give us the information that is requested .
The number of people employed for the amount of money being invested is again quite disproportionate .
So I hope that the answers will be given to Parliament and to the Committee on Budgetary Control .
I think that is about all I need to say .
On that basis I recommend to this House a discharge .
I have , what is more , received no complaints from any officials at all .
I should , however , like to make two observations .
My personal preference would be for adopting a more self-critical attitude .
The Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy regrets the inaccuracies in one third of payments .
What does the Commissioner intend to do about this ?
Has the Commission ever taken legal action ?
Or does it intend to ?
I would like to have these questions answered .
The success and usefulness of the research programmes are beyond dispute .
We are prepared to grant discharge under these conditions .
However , this is not the place for such personal experiences .
Firstly , certain measures dating back to before 1989 have still not been completed .
The conditional postponement of the discharge suggested by Mrs Stauner is to be welcomed .
Then there is still the staffing problem .
In the light of this , there is a great need for reform on this score .
I would like to underline the confidence we have in the Commission and all its Commissioners .
Today we are debating the discharge for the 1998 financial year .
The error rate was considered to be too high by the Court of Auditors .
However , this gives the Commission no cause whatsoever for complacency .
You addressed this point , Mr van den Berg .
This Commission has no fear of any findings .
I shall fight for clear rules within the framework of the financial regulation .
This is why the European Anti-Fraud Office is being reinforced .
This can also be seen from the financial corrections quoted under number 1 .
I expressly state that I agree with number 4 .
It is also a prerequisite to our being able to reduce the error rate still further .
The recruitment procedure for the remaining six posts has already been completed , or will be shortly .
Allow me to conclude with a few comments on the declaration of assurance .
This question is , of course , addressed first and foremost to the Court of Auditors .
The Commission notes this proposal with interest .
A few words now on Mr Casaca ' s report .
I should also like to thank you , Mr Casaca , for your report .
The purpose of the proposed amendment tabled here is to improve controls .
I should like to make the following comments on the proposed amendments .
And that is what we have done in the Committee on Budgetary Control over recent weeks .
We are working on that .
Mrs Schreyer also mentioned it .
However , I am warning you that the Commission is heading straight for the same fate as its predecessor .
This includes reappraising old cases .
The rapporteur quotes four cases by way of example .
Here too the Commission misunderstands our basic cause for concern .
The resignation of the previous Commission did not put an end to it .
Cover-ups or even sweeping issues under the carpet are not the answer .
I know , Mrs Schreyer , that you have tabled an action plan .
Nonetheless , the error rate has remained at the same high level for the last five years .
We shall have to debate this .
Excuses and promises are no use .
We need clear proof of improvement .
We check their accounts .
We ensure that policies have been well managed .
That was clearly used as a political battering ram .
Mrs Stauner quoted Goethe .
I will quote Shakespeare .
The report was full of sound and fury signifying nothing .
We would like to thank the rapporteur for her cooperation on that .
This discharge procedure should be an opportunity to study systems failures within the Commission .
We expect an external element to be included , as advised by the Committee of Independent Experts .
Let us not forget that here we are considering the discharge for 1998 .
We do not want witch-hunts .
We want answers as to how best we spend European taxpayers ' money .
Mr Kuhne has done an excellent job as rapporteur for the Parliament discharge .
There is no doubt that there have been vast improvements in Parliament 's performance .
There has been a great deal of talk about a report on political group expenditure .
The fact is that our committee has not seen this report .
It has still not been published officially , and therefore it is difficult for us to comment on it .
But transparency is a principle that we must hold dear in this context .
I am delighted that Mrs Rühle has done such a great job on the EDF report .
Mr Mulder has done a great job as well , displaying his usual wizardry with the EAGGF accounts .
We are voting for postponement on many accounts .
The important reports , of course , will come next .
It is important that we find a new way of doing it .
It is always greatly appreciated .
As far as the Stauner report is concerned , the liberal group is able to support the compromise resolution .
This was already mentioned last night .
I would like to make a brief comment on the report by Mr Kuhne .
I would now like to come back to the Stauner report and a number of points made in it .
The Court of Auditors will shortly be publishing a report on the so-called Fléchard affair .
A few things are already clear , however , irrespective of the fraud affair itself .
The documents disappeared everywhere simultaneously .
The big question to the Commission is : what has it since done on this score ?
Secondly , we would like proportionality explained .
Should large businesses pay larger fines than small businesses ?
Thirdly , where does the Commissioners ' responsibility lie ?
To what extent can officials decide some things for themselves ?
This is an extremely political issue .
It is not enough to say that it should come down .
Then Parliament would know where it stood .
This is what it is all about at the end of the day .
Europe ' s ideal needs to be preserved .
We must restore the public ' s lost confidence in the European institutions .
We hope that the action plan will help the administration to achieve better management .
We know all about the pressure of time up to the point of discharge .
The report by the financial controller , for example , was submitted relatively late .
Obviously it was not possible to submit this action plan in time for today ' s decision .
We need clear-cut criteria and clear-cut guidelines .
It is the question of control which is at issue here .
They tell me that it has to be written with a limited number of digits .
Perhaps CCB would be useful since this is the formula used in other bodies .
Mr President , the European Union lacks moral authority .
That is particularly problematic in matters of finances .
To maintain its own self-respect Parliament must accept the rules and regulations for the Members forthwith .
Parliament must investigate the misappropriation of funds by its political groups .
Those parliamentary members that compiled the list were obviously right .
They are the home guard for the officials that have behaved dishonourably .
Most of the officials in the EU are diligent and decent people .
However , postponing the discharge is justified and is the correct course of action in this situation .
We shall therefore vote against the discharge for Parliament ' s 1998 accounts .
Mrs Theato should know that we value her desire to call a spade a spade .
I have not even mentioned the overlap which exists in a large number of these European credits .
National states provide development aid , so does Europe .
National states combat racism , so does Europe .
National states support the women ' s movement , so does Europe .
National states support the trade unions and parties , so does Europe .
National states support all kinds of Third Way movements , so does Europe .
And so on and so forth .
I should also like to complement Mrs Stauner on a good report .
How is it different from the Commission which was overturned ?
Are our rapporteurs now getting complete information and full answers in response to their questions ?
You operate on the principles of absolute monarchy .
Come out into the open and acknowledge that it is no longer possible to govern with old-fashioned secrecy .
Admit that you will be replaced if you continue to sweep the dirt under the carpet .
And we must apply the same critical standard against ourselves .
I congratulate all the rapporteurs on the discharges before the House this morning .
I have a few comments on Mr Kuhne ' s and Mrs Stauner ' s reports .
Firstly , on the question of the Parliament discharge .
It is not a question of parallelism , it is a question of substance .
Secondly , I turn to Mrs Stauner ' s excellent report and the explanatory statement .
The explanatory statement very clearly sets out the reasons for so doing .
I come to two points here .
The first is access to information .
Parliament is not getting the answers it requires .
Secondly , the question of the disciplinary procedure .
It is an arbitrary procedure .
I am thinking of the case of Mr Zavvos in particular .
Therefore we , as a Parliament , should look at each of these cases as it stands .
The provisions of the financial regulation on this point do not need to be revised .
It is obvious that some people have been living in glass houses in Brussels for a very long time .
Our most powerful weapon in this regard is the discharge .
In this way , we can keep the pressure on and bring about real reform .
I would like to illustrate this with a recent example .
I am keen , therefore , to share with you my initial reaction .
The Kuhne report is Parliament ' s first report which takes discharge seriously .
I do not share this view .
In my opinion , we should raise the standard for ourselves .
We are the controlling body .
We have the direct link with the citizen .
We are primarily responsible for restoring their confidence in the European project .
This is why it is not enough to measure up against the non-elected officials within the Commission .
We should outstrip them by far . Unfortunately , nothing is further from the truth .
But whether it will be adopted at this stage remains to be seen .
We must think very hard about this so that we can actually restore the citizen ' s confidence .
To grant discharge is , when all is said and done , to grant a certificate of good management .
Secondly , I would like to comment on the Kuhne report .
I am not trying to argue that what is wrong is right .
I wish to make it absolutely clear here that the Kuhne report does not follow this theme .
Mr Kuhne has completed an excellent piece of work .
His report incisively denounces what is going wrong in our institutions .
Mrs Morgan told us a moment ago that we do not want witch-hunts .
But Mrs Morgan , this is not happening .
The complaints are staggering and include a faulty inventory and many thefts .
I was a victim of this myself in a previous life when my computer and printer were stolen .
This is no longer the exception .
The price tag is FFR 27.4 million .
This is ludicrous !
He is blaming us for playing a party-political game .
Well , Mr Kuhne , I can assure you that this is not the case .
What we are doing is being consistent in our approach , however .
I am now counting on a majority in the plenary meeting .
The Treaties clearly establish the exclusive competence of Parliament in matters of budgetary control .
The Stauner report deserves every support on this score .
These shady tricks must stop at once .
We also need to search our own hearts regarding public tenders .
Why such a steep rise ?
The Secretary-General has mentioned a few procedural reasons , but is this the full story ?
A clarification regarding this drastic rise is urgently required .
Rapporteur Kuhne also puts his finger on the problems regarding the financing of the Spinelli building .
This is the umpteenth affair involving new buildings .
We can no longer afford to cover the above issues with the cloak of charity .
We need to exert parliamentary pressure to bring about the necessary reforms .
We could have mentioned other problems arising from the TACIS or PHARE programmes .
Documents must not disappear .
I will give you an additional piece of information .
This debate must not concentrate excessively on the accounting issues .
It is a general debate .
You know that an unknown amount of money is lost through fraud or misappropriation .
More resources are lost through lack of motivation than through misappropriation .
Of course we must .
However we must not compare separate issues .
For example , the auditor has not detected any irregularity in Parliament ' s budget .
We must therefore be prudent and fair and try to treat everyone as they deserve .
I will end by saying that you can reply to the 17 questions we have raised .
So far , it has not shown much desire to do so .
I should like to give an example .
It was sent to the Commission in November .
I hope the Commission will take our demands seriously .
I should like to explain what the ECHO case is about .
The ECHO scandal has still not led to any repercussions .
The problem is that the ECHO case is not about property crime .
Now , the Commission has until 15 May to solve the problem .
The Commission ' s delegations have failed .
Unfortunately , there are too many delegations which are just there for the ride .
I look forward to seeing the results .
Mr President , the issue of discharge is an immense one for the institutions of the EU .
The reports concerning discharge show just how badly administrative reforms are needed .
Commissioner Kinnock ' s package of reforms must be pushed through without delay .
The main focus is the reform of internal auditing in each of the institutions .
Administration and auditing must go hand in hand to preserve a sense of personal responsibility and help it grow .
It is totally impossible to find anyone who will take responsibility .
Improving the quality of administration is a basic requirement for a greater sense of responsibility and better efficiency .
Increased control is only a reflection of the fact that the organisation has failed .
The main financial difficulties focus on the largest budgetary category , agriculture .
This is both embarrassing and distasteful .
We must act in such a way that EU property is treated with the same respect as other property .
In this connection , we must check up on the matter of parliamentary administration .
According to the budget , this investigation will be given to an independent expert .
I was perfectly aware of its importance .
At the same time , there was the so-called European nuclear affair .
We might be satisfied with some of the explanations that the Commission offers for these incidents .
As are we .
Then everyone will have a true picture .
Questions can hurt .
But what matter are the results which will be presented on 15 May .
In this specific situation , it would seem that the current discharge procedure would be a perilous exercise .
I shall conclude by mentioning the internal reform of the Commission .
Mr President , this is a useful and very necessary procedure .
It is necessary to acknowledge that 98 % was properly spent .
I thank Mrs Stauner for her report .
Some people have criticised it for being a bit too severe .
I would not entirely accept the explanatory statement .
We ought avoid particularly vendettas between an institution and individual commissioners .
We never sought to ensure that our regulations were enforceable .
Parliament employed its powers in a sound manner under special circumstances .
A college of Commissioners , which has since been appointed , has presented an ambitious reform programme .
Needless to say , Parliament needs to keep a critical eye on the Commission .
I would like to single out one point from among these questions and requests .
The procedure needs to be completely overhauled .
The Commission has made suggestions to this effect in its White Paper .
However , these suggestions do not go far enough .
I would ask the Commission to reconsider its position .
He did not let himself be talked into adjusting his well-balanced approach in the face of sometimes heated publications .
One of the key proposals is to separate the audit and financial control functions .
The Commission has already indicated that it will submit proposals to this effect before the summer .
I am of the opinion that such separation should also take place within Parliament .
This compromise has three distinct advantages over the rapporteur ' s initial draft .
In this respect , the report has been improved .
These are the three positive features .
There are , however , three forms of sidelong shift which give me pause .
The first is that we are forgetting what the discharge procedure consists of .
This gives us grounds for concern .
Mr President , I shall focus on only one point : access to information .
Many of my colleagues have raised this issue this morning .
We need better access in order to move forward .
We have asked Members of Parliament to volunteer to follow budget lines .
What we need from the Commission is a new system .
We need to know that money is being spent properly .
If we have that confidence we can pass that message on to the public in Europe .
My colleague , Mrs Morgan , spoke earlier about the need to overhaul the whole discharge procedure .
That is right .
First of all , I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur for her report .
I would ask the Commission to pay more attention to this aspect .
Secondly , I would like to mention the issue of financing .
Unfortunately , these problems have not been solved .
This merits further attention too .
Finally , I would like to mention the problem surrounding the Leonardo programme .
These are the key points which I would like to highlight here .
I welcome Mrs Stauner 's report for a number of reasons .
These are all relevant nowadays because we must learn the lessons from them .
Any new proof that arises from these cases must be investigated .
These investigations must be very rigorous and must be reported back to us .
OLAF must use its teeth .
I hope that Commissioner Kinnock listens to this debate and will reflect upon .
I also wish to make a couple of points on the Kuhne report on Parliament 's own budget discharge .
I hope the Commission takes the time to look at this debate seriously .
This Parliament is very serious in the way it discharges various budgets .
I should also like to comment on Mr Blak ' s question on the questionnaires .
There has been a specific procedure for questionnaires in the past .
The committee has now changed this , albeit informally .
We have to discuss this with the director of OLAF .
Another important point is the question of disciplinary procedure and I should like to comment on this .
Nonetheless , our reform must remain within the bounds of the European Treaty .
A multitude of points were made but I should like to comment on the question of the discharge procedure .
Mr Mulder , you also returned to this point .
It is not a question of reducing control but of making it more efficient .
No one must be able to hide behind centralised financial control .
On the contrary , the objective is to take clear steps to achieve a better result in the future .
That is the purpose of the action plan submitted by the Commission .
I would be glad to comply with this request because I think it too helps clarify matters .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m.
( The sitting was suspended at 11.45 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon )
I need not add anything further since Parliament , I am sure , will welcome this .
( The President declared the common position approved as amended )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Before the final vote :
Ladies and gentlemen , the Commission supports all the proposed amendments adopted .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Before the vote on the amendments :
I am sorry but it is too late .
The request was not submitted in time .
It has to be made the evening before the votes .
The Rules are very clear .
If we start breaking that rule then it just creates chaos during the votes .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTES
Staes report ( A5-0084 / 2000 ) :
At that time the Commission announced a legislative programme with a view to improving food safety regulations .
At the time , several problems had been identified .
Obviously , this is extremely reprehensible and even irresponsible !
Lannoye report ( A5-0072 / 2000 ) :
The time devoted to preparing meals has been reduced considerably .
At the moment , this criterion is the weightiest consideration .
Usefulness for the consumer is a particularly vague concept .
Finally , there is the criterion of harmlessness .
There are still loopholes !
Our diet , however , often contains a cocktail of different substances whose combined effect is rarely identified !
The precautionary principle must be used with the utmost rigour in matters of foodstuffs !
The Commission ' s proposal has not taken adequate account of this principle !
Kirkhope report ( A5-0090 / 2000 ) :
Users of child pornography must be punished severely to serve as examples .
The European Parliament must make bold proposals and must remain very vigilant .
We must utilise all the preventative and restrictive means possible to combat such phenomena .
This proposal is a step in this direction and I can therefore only give it my support .
The twenty-first century is the century of communications .
Some people will retort , as they often do , that it has always existed and will always exist .
What a fatalistic comment , and what resignation , what contempt for the human condition !
Frahm report ( A5-0091 / 2000 ) :
But what additional contribution is this Fund going to make exactly , in comparison with the present situation ?
Europe is thus creating a good reputation for itself on the cheap .
This represents a clear improvement on prevalent practice to date .
As is often the case , this allocation is inadequate to handle the actual requirements .
In order to obtain real results , the budget for this Fund must be increased .
Nor will it improve the legal security of persons fleeing persecution and in search of protection .
The European Union calls throughout the world for freedom of movement for capital .
Every year many refugees die , killed on the external borders of the EU .
That concludes the vote .
( The sitting was suspended at 12.25 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Outcome of the European Council in Lisbon , 23 -24 March 2000
This is an open method of coordination , which we hope will produce optimal results .
It was certainly a turning point .
The Lisbon debate generated substantial agreement on most issues .
These issues are major but they are limited in number .
This high level of consensus allowed the Presidency to set an extremely ambitious agenda .
I will not go into the conclusions in too great a detail , but stick to the main points .
Research , education and lifelong learning all received a boost .
The Commission is therefore going to play a central role in the follow-up to this Summit .
The Commission must act as the driving force in this process .
I am determined to see that this Commission makes good its promises .
I repeat before this House that the need for this coordination is urgent , spectacularly urgent .
We also agreed to speed up the procedures for supplying aid to the Balkans .
I am counting on your full support and your cooperation to help us to achieve this .
It is our duty not to let them down .
I will borrow the words of the Presidency .
The Union will act as a catalyst in the process .
It will not be .
Let me issue a second word of warning . We are on the threshold of enlargement .
Madam President , the Lisbon Summit will mark a milestone .
This is a quotation from Belgium ' s Liberal Prime Minister .
The untrammelled free market seems to be their only god .
Yet the market economy must necessarily have a social dimension .
These are the words of Mrs Nicole Fontaine , the President of this Parliament .
We wish to combine economic efficiency , quality of life and social protection .
We want sustainable development in all these aspects .
( Applause from the left )
Finally , I would offer an important and perhaps less complimentary remark .
The conclusions of the Portuguese Presidency contain many positive commitments and objectives .
The first point is the strategic goal .
There is not one line on the reports which the Commission nonetheless submitted at the European Council in Helsinki .
Not one line on the practical implementation of Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union .
The second point relates to employment .
The same applies to the matter of taxation , which you mentioned .
This is also true of the Monti package .
I cannot however be delighted by it .
In my opinion , this is indeed a huge challenge which must be accepted .
I could go on , as there are countless conclusions completely identical to those in the 1993 White Paper .
There is nevertheless one aspect that deserves a particular mention in the area of policies for full employment .
This applies to both positive and negative aspects .
The Presidency ' s conclusions talk of " the European social model " .
The real problem is being completely ignored .
I must issue a strong warning against doing any such thing .
There is to be a commitment to majority decision-making in this area .
The most significant legacy of the European Council ' s summit in Lisbon is all the unresolved problems .
Since Essen , we have had numerous declarations of intent and well-meant action programmes .
Paper is cheap .
Unfortunately there is a total lack of concrete results .
We are all familiar with these requirements .
Everyone says , " Yes , that is quite right " .
But implementation is where it falls down .
The ability to be democratic goes hand in hand with the ability to discuss .
It is in the interests of the Union to clarify relations between Austria and the EU .
Refusing all discussion was never a recipe for resolving a conflict .
These symbolic gestures are the right way to open up old wounds between people .
Judge the Austrian government by its deeds .
You will not find any violation of the spirit of the Union .
( Applause from the right )
To call it the Employment Summit , however , would be to depart from its real purpose .
In this case , it was done out of political expediency .
The truth is that the objective of employment goes far beyond these issues .
I shall not dwell too much on the specifics of the Lisbon Summit .
A lot of us have been through that already and we welcome many of the conclusions .
There is a challenge in realising the full potential of the e-economy .
That is our challenge .
In conclusion , I thank the Portuguese presidency very much .
I wish to discuss this problem , which affects fundamental European policies .
The Council ought to think about this and work towards a real Europe .
This is the way we may finally achieve more balanced and more democratic European institutions .
This really is the type of authoritarian attitude which should be a thing of the past .
It is not up to the authorities to say how many women must go out to work .
This is a matter for the interested parties and civil society .
The reality is that the European social model is now living in London and she is called Laetitia Casta .
There is tension around Europe but at the same time I detect a sea-change .
I rarely speak in debates after summits but this is an important one .
I therefore look forward to some genuine action from the European Commission .
It is action not words that is needed .
Do not worry , it is meaningless .
We do not need the heavy regulatory touch of the past .
It is a question of strategy really .
So what is the strategy for making a success of this incredible economic transformation Lisbon is promising us ?
It is a strategy which is radically innovative .
The most basic example is employment .
Europe currently has 16 million unemployed whom it cannot absorb .
Some say these figures are set to reach 1.6 million next year .
We do not appear to have solved any problems whatsoever .
This is the simple yet great idea of Lisbon .
Such cynicism borders on candour !
Lisbon aroused expectations as far as rectifying these shortcomings is concerned .
Mr President , I welcome the Lisbon conclusions .
Partly that follow-up is institutional .
What will the role of the Commission and this institution be ?
Will it , in fact , be largely intergovernmental ?
If so , I think we will be disappointed .
But we are not just concerned about the institutional follow-up .
We are also concerned about the substance .
So we are concerned with the substantive follow-up as well .
One point disappoints me - that is the stance of the EPP in all this .
We welcome the emphasis upon the smooth and efficient functioning of markets .
But as always we want that to be balanced by solidarity and social inclusion .
Improving quality must not only be directed at Community legislation but also at the legislation of the Member States .
We must review the ' Best Business Impact ' initiative .
Returning to simplification , the SLIM initiative requires a complete revision .
We need expiry clauses and we need to improve codification .
We have to tackle that reform of the Treaty .
Lastly , we have to regulate more quickly and be more effective .
Therefore we need to make improvements in that respect as well .
This is a domain of severe under-achievement in the European Union .
We need deeper knowledge in science and technology .
The sixth framework programme will be another tool .
As well as deeper knowledge , we need wider knowledge .
We need to use the knowledge in better ways .
We also need new sustainable technologies .
Let us hope that it is carried into effect and is more than mere soundbites and press releases .
I have no doubt that she was prompted by the best humanitarian intentions .
This goes beyond socialism , this is pure Marxism .
Her remarks fit this depressing tradition perfectly .
Congratulations , Mr President .
We too would like to congratulate you , Mr Gama .
There is a certain likeness between you and your distant predecessor Vasco da Gama at Cape of Good Hope .
The employment situation in Europe seems to be slightly improving .
It remains to be seen whether they will materialise or not .
We have listed a few problems .
We also hope that they will implement it efficiently .
Can the Council really back out of its responsibility in the individual Member States so easily ?
As the European Parliament , we should not accept this .
It needs to be done locally .
In the end , people will take their leave of such a Europe .
We must not allow that to happen .
Mr President , I believe in a common strategy which must be monitored from within Europe .
I think that the Lisbon Summit has given us a new impulse in this respect .
This is important and these are aspects which one would expect from a Summit .
The e-commerce document springs to mind , for example .
This is an existing document .
Another example is the intention to draft a legislative frame for pension funds .
This intention was formulated a long time ago .
This is very serious .
I would like to list three elements which are lacking in my opinion .
In order to take action in the economic field , fiscal integration is required .
Secondly , social security .
There should be a convergence programme , a kind of guideline for social security .
This is its strength .
This begs another comment on Lisbon .
You must understand that this is a network .
That is clear .
This is the potential significance of Lisbon .
My final point is , once again , the development of human resources .
This applies to both new and old economies as well .
This gives me great pleasure for few people remember it .
In my opinion , these are the genuinely important horizontal decisions adopted in Lisbon .
Thank you very much , Mr President of the Commission .
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon .
The debate is closed .
EU - Africa Summit ( Cairo , 3 and 4 April 2000 )
I would like to highlight some significant measures adopted by the summit .
This report will then be studied at ministerial level , under the summit ' s monitoring mechanism .
Some progress was made on this issue too .
The last part of the action plan concerns the monitoring mechanisms .
We are spending development assistance money at the level of EUR 2.5 bn per year .
Here the EU is still waiting for a number of G7 countries to play their part .
The summit provided an opportunity for useful discussions on debt and other bilateral problems .
The declaration and plan of action adopted at the summit take account of the sensitivities on both sides .
The text adopted in Lisbon by the forum was widely distributed by the Algerian and Portuguese presidencies .
The background is that we already have a credible working relationship .
We have already seen some good election results .
Peace can bring prosperity .
Mr President , I appreciate that wide-ranging coverage of the issues by Mr Corrie .
The Cairo summit will be followed up by another forum in Dakar on basic education .
The need for basic education is the single most important cause of global poverty .
Dakar is an opportunity to deliver on internationally agreed targets .
The EU should put its political will behind universal primary education by the year 2015 .
Clearly commitments made a decade ago have not materialised .
40 million African children today are not attending school .
One third of the classrooms in Africa do not even have a blackboard .
They have no toilets .
70 % of their schools do not have any clean water .
Some of you may be aware that Julius Nyrere spent his spare time translating Shakespeare into Swahili .
But that man ' s wonderful dreams were lost .
He lived to see one third of African men illiterate and two thirds of African women .
Will anything come out of a meeting of this kind ?
Well , that probably depends upon how you look at it .
That was not , of course , the purpose of the summit .
This would enable us to pursue relations on a sounder basis .
And the Members of the European Union must stop lying .
But none of this is the key issue .
Indeed , the conclusions do not strike me as being adequate to address current needs and opportunities .
This is the route we must follow in the future .
Because no destination was established .
Where do you expect to get if you do not know where exactly you are heading ?
The next objective was Socialism , the fair-haired comrades .
Black Africa was supposed to turn red .
The result was a permanent situation of coup d ' état , even in the Ivory Coast .
The present objective appears to be liberalism , the market , the IMF , the World Trade Organisation .
They even set a figure : 159 million Africans were to be unloaded on Europe by 2025 .
This solution has been worked out in theoretical terms , and called ' self-centred development ' .
For the Africans it was a negative outcome .
In this respect , the Mediterranean could serve as a test bench for a Euro-African policy which respects identities .
We have proposed an international organisation , with an intergovernmental high-secretariat of the Mediterranean .
This would have its headquarters in Cairo , Tangiers or Tunis .
An interparliamentary assembly , like that of the ACP .
And there perhaps the words of Raymond Loulle would hold sway .
It could then be extended to relations between Europe and sub-Saharan Africa .
I disagree with him on this .
Commissioner Nielson also said something to that effect .
I think that the atmosphere is important , but as a basis for reaching sound agreements .
If the agreements are not forthcoming , then a good atmosphere is neither here nor there .
Nonetheless , an EU-Africa Summit is to be welcomed .
I also feel positive about the Portuguese Presidency ' s initiative .
Mr President , the African countries have asked us to clear their debts .
So it is a pity that a number of things prevented that potential from being fully realised .
Civil society has a key role to play in Africa ' s development process .
Illiteracy and unemployment affect the vast majority of young people on the African continent .
Moreover , the IMF ordered ultraliberal policies , supposedly for structural adjustment .
These are policies that have never worked anywhere .
Quite the opposite .
I do not know of a single example of a country which made any progress by applying their directives .
We agree that we cannot carry on supporting dictators in the name of Realpolitik .
Finally , Mr President , Europe too made its wealth from colonialism and slavery .
Europe thus has a moral debt towards Africa .
Part of our wealth came from the colonial plundering inflicted on Africa .
Acknowledging that slavery was a crime against humanity would be an important gesture .
There is no doubt that the many informal contacts which the Summit created have been useful .
In that sense , Cairo was not a Euro-African Summit but more like a summit of élites .
It is evident that our political models cannot simply be transplanted .
Africa has to find meaning for the notion of democracy itself .
What other messages does the Commission need in order to suspend development aid ?
It is high time that the European Union told the African dictators where their responsibility lies .
This event must not be used as an alibi ; it must mark the beginning of a real partnership .
But who notices that here in Europe ?
That is immoral and an important chance to make a move towards reconciliation may have been wasted .
Banning the NGO meeting from Cairo was a most unpleasant side effect .
Mr President , the Cairo Summit has been genuinely significant , an historic milestone .
It has been significant in terms of its meaning but also in terms of its lack of achievement .
It is also significant insofar as its conclusions could not have been more feeble .
Obviously no one was particularly interested in apprising the African states of this fact .
What the topic of conversation was , one may only speculate .
This seems to be the pattern for the Summit in Cairo too .
Some think it is a missed opportunity .
This is as much our fault as it is Africa ' s .
Such a step is significant .
You cannot develop the African people from within Europe .
A new framework such as this really creates opportunities .
Within this framework , room must be made for conflict prevention .
Ordinary , regular contacts cannot work miracles .
They will not bring about marvellous new results , but they are necessary .
They should become the norm .
I would like to add one more point .
Natural disasters , including climate change , have aggravated the problem .
They are poor , insecure and exposed to the elements .
They have no stake in their village , regional or national economies .
I would like to clarify a few points .
My only regret is that attendance is low , but it is nevertheless of an extremely high calibre .
And the OAU , for its part , does not have a parliament .
Another important point is debt .
We must not forget that there is a qualitative difference .
This is unprecedented and has never been done by any other group of countries .
It is extremely innovative and is greatly welcomed by these countries .
The problem of reducing or cancelling debt could not be solved at the summit .
The African countries considered this to be one of the most important milestones of this summit .
It was time to put right this delay .
It had never been done before .
It was the first time .
We took that step .
It is also essential for the European Union to have an African agenda .
We , that is , Parliament , the Commission and the Council , are all working towards this .
Let me refer to some of the specific points made in the debate .
Mrs Kinnock mentioned the forthcoming meeting in Dakar on basic education .
I have discussed AIDS in Africa with President Mugabe .
I am not claiming to portray the whole situation in Zimbabwe but this is an important point .
I appreciate the support from Parliament to that effect .
Mrs Maij-Weggen mentioned that development aid has progressed over the years .
I wish that were true .
If we look at total official development assistance , globally it has in fact decreased .
We are now down to 0.23 % and many governments should and could do more .
We should be proud of that and we should make the most of it in political relations also .
This is something that should not be forgotten in the on-going discussions .
Mr Zimmerling mentioned the problem of Nigeria and getting money back .
This should be part of international economic governance .
Money should not be able to disappear as has been the case .
It was of real importance that the Heads of State and Governments spent two days together .
They got along quite well .
They certainly developed quite well in those two days .
It was very successful and it has been a pleasure working with the presidency .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
External relations package
The next item is the Commission communication on the external relations package .
We have spent EUR 150 million on this important activity .
It invites everyone to try to learn the lessons of the past .
It is a very practical document .
Let me turn to a subject on which I would like to address the Parliament at rather greater length .
The people making those complaints were very often justified in doing so - not always - but very often .
Our procedures are old fashioned , they are as I said ' cumbersome ' .
We have to do better and we can do better .
We will present our proposals in the next few weeks .
I hope that support will be forthcoming because we have time to lose .
Inertia is only part of our problem today .
The rapid reaction facility responds to these needs .
I am suggesting a mechanism with the following broad characteristics .
Action should not normally last for more than nine months .
Third , as with ECHO , the procedures must be streamlined .
It builds on existing Community instruments , putting them to concerted use in a new framework .
There is an inevitable , indeed necessary , area of overlap with existing instruments .
I repeat : the facility does not create a new instrument .
The facility is a kind of quick-start package .
I have dealt with that point earlier in my remarks .
It is not an ideal solution .
My own favourite economist and guru , Jane Jacobs , points out that everything is disappointing in practice .
I have a question pertaining to his first point .
The European Union , which may be present on a massive scale , is really lacking such an image .
The honourable Member has , as ever , made an extremely shrewd observation .
There is an image problem . It is one we address in the communication .
Image is important and we have addressed it in this document .
Mr President , Commissioner . I concur with Mrs Maij-Weggen ' s question .
What sort of timetable should we be working towards ?
Thirdly , Commissioner , not all , but many crises to which we must react can be prevented .
The first is the lack of a clear EU policy and the necessary instruments to implement it .
Another factor is the participation of the European Union under the umbrella of other international actors .
We have politicians who are actually still in the kitchen feeling the heat .
At which point discretion is the better part of valour .
I have enough anecdotes to justify my impatience .
Of course , if you can act more rapidly , you make a contribution to crisis prevention .
There are a number of things we will be doing .
I look forward to coming to Parliament with some further ideas over the coming months .
The idea is that the late payment directive could also be applied in these areas .
That is an interesting and important point , which I shall follow up .
It is an extremely valuable contribution .
I should like to ask the Commissioner a couple of questions .
For a start , it would be nice always to know what Member States are doing .
So we need to work more closely and in a more coordinated way .
That is an issue which the High Representative and I are attempting to take on more positively .
We will keep in touch with them .
We can manage EUR 30 or 40 million .
I should like to begin by thanking the Commissioner for an excellent exposition of the rapid reaction facility .
It is much needed .
There are different sorts of crises and different sorts of disaster .
The appalling floods in Mozambique were a classic case for intervention by ECHO as a humanitarian intervention .
It is very difficult to compartmentalise these crises .
Very often you need to use a number of instruments .
There need to be " Chinese walls " only in the budgetary sense .
Commissioner , thank you very much for your statement .
I strongly welcome this rapid reaction facility .
It responds to long-held concerns which many of us have had .
You are to be congratulated on the work that you have done .
I should like to elaborate on the point which my colleague Nirj Deva mentioned .
We are not just talking about urgency , we are not just talking about effectiveness of action .
The question of coherence is very important .
You have the overall responsibility for external relations from the Commission 's point of view .
I am thinking again of the role of ECHO .
I recognise the case for coherence .
It would be challenging politically , to get up and make a speech in favour of incoherence .
The honourable Member is entirely right about that .
But one has to bear in mind two important facts about ECHO .
Secondly , it is very often the case that what marketing managers would call the deliverables are different .
Very often with ECHO one is talking about food , medicine and blankets .
There are differences .
But I totally accept that there is a need for more cohesion .
It is a considerable advantage that in this Commission the external relations commissioners work together as a team .
We are about to start sharing all the programming decisions together .
It has not always been the case in the past .
The practical implementation is the difficult bit .
The problems in the Great Lakes region cover a number of countries .
Would the Commissioner agree with that ?
I agree with the honourable Member on that point .
I just wish to congratulate the Commissioner on his replies .
That is unacceptable .
The stores down there are empty .
Where was ECHO ?
Absolutely nothing has been done .
I shall be setting out the figures for our actual disbursements of food aid in Ethiopia and Eritrea .
I just wish to add two points .
We have managed to increase our ability to deliver humanitarian assistance .
There is a food crisis in the Horn of Africa .
So I hope I catch your eye tomorrow in the debate and make some of these points .
I have great sympathy for the problems being faced by Ethiopia and Eritrea .
Mr President , on a point of order .
Could you let us know exactly how Question Time is going to be organised now ?
Will questions to the Commission - ostensibly due between 6.30 p.m. and 7 p.m. be taken ?
I can inform you that Question Time will last an hour .
Therefore , we will be working from seven until eight .
The first part , Questions to the Commission , will last 30 minutes .
We will dedicate 10 minutes to each Commissioner , instead of the usual 20 minutes .
Question Time ( Commission )
The next item is Question Time ( B5-0216 / 2000 ) . We will examine questions to the Commission .
Question No 34 by ( H-0306 / 00 ) :
Can the Commission explain the reasons for this non-participation ?
Will the Commission insist on its right to participate ?
We are still discussing arrangements for the interim military body .
I realise that the honourable Member is a greater expert on these institutional issues than I am .
It is not therefore surprising that he is holed in one .
I very much hope that it can be resolved satisfactorily over the coming weeks .
I certainly do not think that is an issue .
I hope that we can solve this in a civilised and sensible way .
I repeat , we do not have - to borrow a phrase - " ideas above our station " .
Thank you very much , Mr Patten .
I believe we have asked you all the questions we were going to ask you today .
We therefore wish you a good afternoon .
Question No 32 by ( H-0293 / 00 ) :
They work and are given holiday-time , but they are unable to go on ordinary tours .
It has nothing to do with whether someone is chronically ill or an acute case .
The Commission departments have made such information available .
Question No 33 by ( H-0298 / 00 ) :
If I am not mistaken , the Commission is not considering this option .
No applications have been filed .
That is the drawback with this variation .
The Commissioner actually answered my question in the second part of his answer .
We take note of your statement in favour of good chocolate , Mrs Banotti .
Question No 35 by ( H-0307 / 00 ) :
This is not a problem specific to the candidate countries of the European Union .
Allow me to tell you what we can do within the framework of accession negotiations .
That includes the legally binding regulations for the protection of children .
The countries seeking to join the Union can also join this programme .
Then there is the STOP programme for the period from 1996 to 2000 .
The Commissioner showed us where his heart was in the opening remarks .
There is also the question of Internet pornography .
It is not enough that we have these small , under-funded programmes .
In Romania there are no people paying for it .
Now let me come to Romania .
I cannot confirm the accuracy of the BBC television report .
The fact that something has been broadcast on the BBC does not automatically mean that it is true .
Not that I am saying that it is untrue .
Simply that we cannot confirm it .
It is a problem that should be a cause for concern to everyone in Europe .
I am going to ask you to be brief and I am going to be brief .
This is the Rule in this House .
Question No 37 by ( H-0272 / 00 ) :
The funds required for this task need to be anchored in the budget accordingly .
It is precisely this call that the Commission is addressing .
I hope that , when faced with these realities , Parliament will support the Commission proposal .
All of this demonstrates that Agenda 2000 has been nothing but a great firework display .
This is a disgrace for European agriculture .
It does not surprise me that given this outrage the Commissioner responsible ...
This is a disgrace !
A disgrace !
Does the Commissioner agree with that ?
I should like to thank the honourable Member for his remarks .
We have examined this carefully .
Question No 38 by ( H-0287 / 00 ) :
The absurdity of this system is becoming increasingly apparent .
In the Commission 's view , what structural measures are required to overcome the delays in payments ?
Questions to Mr Kinnock
The Commission is currently updating this analysis .
This applied to a sum of around EUR 1 billion in 1999 .
I hope that we can count on your support .
Thank you for your answer .
Perhaps both these matters are problems which the Commission ought , in that case , to do something about .
I should like to offer my warmest thanks for your suggestion .
Do you intend to use benchmarking or best practice methods ?
Of course the aim is to have few , if any exceptions .
Thank you very much , Mrs Schreyer .
Since the time allotted to Mrs Schreyer has elapsed , Question No 39 will be replied to in writing .
Question No 40 by ( H-0332 / 00 ) :
The Action Plan does not , however , specify that an external legal expert should sit on the board .
I thank the Commissioner for his reply .
. I am grateful to the honourable Member for his question .
Question No 41 by ( H-0342 / 00 ) :
How do you plan to address this ?
Questions to Mr Byrne
In neither case would disciplinary action result from making such reports .
The Commission will present detailed proposals in a document scheduled for October of this year .
Preparatory work on the proposals is progressing under the Director-General for Administration .
I am grateful to the honourable Member for his question .
He made a couple of applications , one of which was for a job in the Commission .
We thank Vice-President Kinnock for his replies .
Question No 49 by ( H-0284 / 00 ) :
Is the Commission of the opinion that the Swedish authorities are complying with common rules ?
I should like to thank you for your answer .
It is a matter costing an incredible amount of money .
I thank the Member for her supplementary question .
As I indicated earlier , this is essentially a matter between two Member States .
The Danish Breeding Association , in my opinion , should have taken up this issue with the Swedish Association .
The way Question Time is run is not acceptable .
Firstly , it does not start on time .
That makes it impossible for Members to be here .
How are we meant to function in this way ?
It makes it virtually impossible for us and is not a fair procedure .
I am therefore very sorry that we now have to conclude Question Time .
We especially thank Mr Byrne who has been here all afternoon so that he could answer questions .
That concludes Questions to the Commission .
( The siting was suspended at 8.10 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
Situation in Turkey
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on Turkey .
Stronger political dialogue is again taking place at all levels .
We plan to submit the first accession partnership in the autumn of this year .
I should , however , like to say a few more words about the political situation in Turkey .
From an economic point of view , Turkey is in a position to make rapid progress .
Of course I shall continue to keep you informed of all aspects of these new endeavours .
The public and private sector spokesmen we recently met in Turkey all readily agreed on this .
The ball is in Turkey ' s court .
Commissioner Verheugen has just recapitulated these expectations .
Mr Birdal advocates peace . Mr Birdal advocates solving the problem of minorities without violence .
Mr Birdal ' s reputation as a human rights activist extends well beyond the borders of Turkey .
The EU will then have to adjust , and in a welcoming way .
I am glad the Commissioner stressed these .
To say this is not to be anti-Turkish .
Will not other Turkish citizens benefit also ?
The mayors belonging to HADEP were arrested and we rightly criticised this move .
Unfortunately , he must serve another six months of a one-year sentence .
And we should not have to wait for a reform policy on the Kurdish question .
We are prepared to be patient as far as the speed of democratisation is concerned .
But we will not accept a standstill on this issue .
In this sense we shall continue to support the Helsinki process .
Including Turkey .
Akin Birdal has started serving the rest of his sentence .
Why are arms being delivered to Turkey ?
It will be the task of the European Commission and the Council to strengthen their commitment here .
There is a very lively debate in the country .
That is very important .
Secondly , the trade unions , popular movements , etc. all say the same thing .
They think it is positive that Turkey is a candidate country .
Perhaps we are seeing something new being born .
But the old legal system is still there .
That is what is working against democratic fighters such as Akin Birdal .
Almost automatically they will have to deliver if Turkey is to become a member one day .
The first was that nothing will prevail without a strong civil society in Turkey .
We know that and we would like the Commission to look into that .
Help us to be more precise with the road-map because we want to follow it .
This is why we want to give Turkey the benefit of the doubt .
Turkey has made none .
Have they still not managed to do so ?
We were not allowed to see her because she was in prison .
Is that such a drastic step ?
Commissioner , you mentioned the interministerial committee .
It is true that numerous structures are being set up .
I have been aware of this in Turkey since 1995 .
The structures are superb , we can all agree on that .
Except that they do nothing .
That is how easy it is to take the first steps .
I warned you about that .
I experienced surprise after surprise and also disappointment after disappointment .
The situation is in fact as a number of fellow Members have described it .
And it must take it , because paper alone is cheap .
Changes need to be made here .
I would like to add two or three minor points .
Turkey has its internal problems , but it has its external problems , too .
But no , this is not the case .
And in politics , false realities produce false results .
As you know , historically , such a thing is just not possible .
Nobody said that !
And this is something upon which we agree .
The European Parliament obviously has an important role to play in this .
Turkey will not be admitted to the European Union without the European Parliament ' s approval .
Turkey has merely been recognised as a candidate .
I can tell you that the Commission is not carrying out an assessment even now .
This has not yet started , but the Commission has been instructed to prepare it .
We are , therefore , at an exploratory stage .
It is obvious that the Turkish political process is a complex one .
I do not know what is easy and what is difficult to do in Turkey .
It is in our interests that the reform-orientated , democratic , pro-Europe forces carry the motion in this debate .
I should like to close by saying that we are still just right at the beginning .
We are in fact at the beginning of the beginning .
We are only just preparing the pre-accession strategy .
I therefore advise on a little patience here .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at the next voting session .
Deliberate release into the environment of GMOs
It seems to me that this vote could be a watershed .
There are a number of critical issues which need to be addressed .
The first and the most important is the issue of producer liability .
In addition to that critical issue there are also a number of other important questions .
We want to ensure that serious consideration is given to the dangers of using these crops .
We have been lobbied by very many groups during the process of developing this legislation .
The lobbying has become quite intense in the last few weeks .
The outcome of the vote in Parliament tomorrow is likely to bring a few shocks and surprises .
That can be only good for the future development of this new technology within the European Union .
For the biotechnology industry that can only be to the good .
Those who know me know that I am not a blind advocate of genetic engineering .
Many aspects worry me .
Take the example of genetic transfer .
All we hear about are Frankenstein plants and superweeds .
I have a key witness here .
We are also opposed to discrimination against biotechnology when it comes to liability .
It has frequently been said that the Commission must be forced to do something at long last .
I think that the common position gives us good control of the risks .
I shall single out the points I think are most important .
I think it is important for health reasons .
I think that is a major flaw in current practice in this area .
In that way , we can be properly sure that the necessary monitoring is carried out .
Finally , I would call attention to the question of objective liability .
I hope we shall see the adoption of these amendments designed to tighten up on the common position .
In my opinion , the present legal basis is far too weak .
The following points are key issues for the Liberal group and these will also influence our voting behaviour .
First and foremost , there is the issue of the freedom of choice for consumers .
One controversial issue is producer liability .
We are in favour of the self-regulating effect this has .
We , too , would like to congratulate the diligent rapporteur on this report .
The proposals to be adopted tomorrow will not go anything like so far as we would have wished .
We shall therefore vote in favour of as satisfactory a solution as possible to the issue as a whole .
A year on , studies have been conducted that even more clearly highlight the dangers of releasing GMOs .
I would remind you that in his contribution , Mr Blokland talked about the importance of the precautionary principle .
We are thus delighted that the Council has underlined this principle in the common position .
On the whole , we should therefore be satisfied with the present proposals .
We are particularly delighted with the stricter wording related to reducing the risks for consumers .
We regret this toning down .
Plants and animals are not production factors which can simply be manipulated .
The biotechnology debate requires an integral ethical approach .
We believe that God created the world .
Based on this awareness , we need to treat the natural world around us responsibly .
You cannot abolish risk because it is part of our natural environment .
I believe there are four areas where we must act to reassure the public .
I believe we can do so without destroying biotechnology .
Firstly , antibiotic-resistant genes must be phased out .
The amendment sets a realistic , but urgent date of 2005 for that .
Secondly , we must be open with the public about where experimental crops are being grown .
That is only right .
It is fair .
We can gain real benefits from GMOs if we get it right .
But we have to take the public with us , with the science .
I believe these measures will help to do just that .
The other issue I should like to address is the contamination of gene transfer .
We have a situation where , for example , conventional farms can be contaminated with GMOs .
This is not acceptable .
Firstly , the protection of public health .
It seems to us that we should strictly forbid the use of antibiotic-resistant genes .
Secondly , the commitment to international agreements .
Finally , Mr President , the prevention of genetic contamination .
Mr President , I should like to start by complimenting Mr Bowe on his objective and balanced presentation .
Of course there are concerns on the part of consumers .
They are entitled to an in-depth and independent evaluation of what is a rapidly changing technology .
In short , the consumer must at all times be given a choice .
We totally agree with the line of thinking adopted in this report .
We must also require the prior approval of the recipient country before any trade can take place .
Europe must not be left behind the USA and Japan .
According to the gene tech industry , the risks of such unwanted contamination are low .
The Christian Democratic position will rebound perfectly off the gene industry .
Mr President , genetic engineering and biotechnology are the key technologies of the future .
We are already lagging far behind other countries .
No one wants to play down genetic engineering , including me .
But nor can we demonise it .
But even though we now have a White Paper , the actual legislation is some years away .
We must address those very real issues .
Consumers are demanding the strictest controls and will be satisfied by nothing less .
It is vital that all the necessary safeguards are now included in this directive .
Genetically modified products and biotechnology give rise to a number of questions and concerns .
The most important are perhaps : what are the benefits ?
What are the risks ?
How do we best avoid possible negative effects ?
How do we ensure that we have access to all the relevant information ?
Here the European institutions , the Member States , industry and science all have to take their responsibilities .
Our role as European policymakers should be to provide for a balanced response to these new challenges .
At the same time , it has to allow society to benefit from the development of modern biotechnology .
We are here today to strengthen and improve the existing framework .
The Commission therefore welcomes the spirit of Amendment No 1 .
Amendments Nos 13 , 14 and 28 are therefore not acceptable in the present revision .
The Commission did exactly that when adopting the White Paper this year .
This will provide clarity for complainants and prevent loopholes .
This is also the best way to complement the existing horizontal system for product liability already covering GMOs .
It must be seen in that context .
However , I cannot accept Amendments Nos 33 , 40 and 45 .
A phase-out is already foreseen in the common position .
The Commission agrees to strengthen this political message .
The Commission cannot agree to a general ban of GMOs containing antibiotic resistance marker genes .
Instead , we should continue to carry out a comprehensive case-by-case risk analysis .
This will be done every three years under Article 30 .
The Commission welcomes Amendments Nos 38 and 49 concerning gene transfer .
They constitute a balanced approach between a total prevention and a permissive approach .
However , the wording should be aligned with the text of the directive .
However , the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 12 concerning the prevention of gene transfer .
Gene transfer between organisms is , as we know , a common phenomenon in nature .
This is both for administrative and legal reasons .
This concerns in particular the plant breeding industry .
This builds on the original proposal as presented at first reading in Parliament .
Finally , I should like to deal as a package with the amendments I have not yet addressed .
Amendment No 6 , concerning a centralised Community procedure , is not acceptable .
Amendment No 32 is therefore not acceptable .
To conclude , we urgently need a revised Directive 90 / 220 .
I just want a yes or no .
My second point is this : unfortunately , you did not go into proposed Amendment No 42 .
Can you confirm that there is no EU legislation for GMOs in contained use ?
I should like a clear answer on this .
I am not reopening the debate .
Commissioner , do you wish to reply ?
. Mr President , I shall start with the second part of Mrs Breyer 's question .
That is why we cannot accept Amendment No 42 .
As you know , we have now issued a White Paper on environmental liability .
Your views are also welcome .
I intend to ensure that this paper covers GMOs .
It already covers product liability .
The White Paper is a first step , as you know .
That has to be discussed in depth and I will come back with a proposal .
I believe it will be possible to put an insurance system in place .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Identification , registration and labelling of beef
In short , we all know what we are talking about .
So we are talking about an extremely complex operation .
I believe that we have managed to achieve this .
I would just like to look at two amendments , two categories of amendments .
The provisions recommended by the Commission are , to my mind , extremely minimal .
I propose that we change this system .
Anyone labelling meat must have explicit approval from the competent public authorities .
We want labels which are practicable , simple , safe , cheap and easy to control .
Consumers want information , not a novel .
This applies in particular to information on the region of origin of the meat .
We shall have problems explaining this to consumers .
It is only a matter of four months .
Mr President , beef labelling has two distinct functions .
The two should not be confused .
The need for information sprang from the BSE crisis .
Therefore people want to know which country their beef comes from .
The well established description of Scotch beef should continue to be used .
We should not go down this road .
Similarly , reference to fattening methods should not be introduced .
Mr President , my group welcomed the report by Mr Papayannakis and salutes him for his persistence .
He has also had to face the obfuscation and delays brought about by the Council .
However , we are not here today for recriminations but for looking ahead .
This is our chance to put right this sorry process of delay .
We do that on the basis that the key proposal plainly has to be the issue of timing .
Some of the versions of this report in themselves have been contradictory in the dates that they gave .
We need to know from which state a product has arrived .
We need traceability and labelling there as much as anywhere else .
My last point is to end where I began .
We know we bore a large part of the responsibility for it .
It was incumbent upon us to make special provisions by way of food safety as a result .
The crucial factor is that it should be possible to trace with certainty the origins of what we eat .
I am very pleased about Mr Whitehead ' s remark about minced meat .
I fully and wholeheartedly support Amendment No 30 from the rapporteur .
They have approached the issue with the same consistency demonstrated by the European Parliament .
The postponement adopted is not lawful .
Nor did the Commission come up smelling of roses here .
It was the Commission which proposed this seemingly elegant but legally dubious procedure .
If nothing is done , compulsory labelling will enter into force on 1 September 2000 .
This system has proved very effective .
It has made it possible to restore consumer confidence .
France had simply forgotten that it no longer had the right to do this .
Consumers want to be certain of the operators ' ability to monitor the origin of meat accurately .
The Member State of origin must therefore be indicated .
This protection is undoubtedly belated in principle but , above all , illusory in practice .
This is a good move .
The amendments will be adopted .
The unwillingness of the Commission is , however , with apologies to the Commissioner , apparent to everyone .
As a solution , labelling is a good idea only at first sight .
The only effective protection would be checks , and this requires States and frontiers .
I just hope , ladies and gentlemen , that no one will have to be punished in future .
Let us not delay , especially as this is no recent matter .
It is high time we took action .
Consumer confidence cannot be decreed , it must be earned .
That is a very fundamental question that must be made perfectly clear in any law that we pass .
Farmers deserve to have a guarantee of that , and so should the consumers .
We will then be where we need to be .
One of these measures is most definitely the use of a label indicating the Member State .
We simply need this .
The work of Mr Papayannakis has already been praised here .
I agree with this .
It is absolutely essential to know what country the products are from .
Labels must also be made compulsory as quickly as possible .
The Member States should have already prepared themselves for it .
Until this is a reality , consumers need to know precisely which country their meat comes from .
The authorisation number does not provide the consumer with any useful information and has no bearing upon traceability .
Such a system must be practicable if it is to achieve its objective .
We must take account of how the procedures will be applied in practice .
Take the example of summer pasturing in the Alps .
As we have said , traceability must be guaranteed in all cases .
It has already been adopted by the Committee on the Environment and in the Committee on Agriculture .
Mr President , the discussion on labelling beef is quite loaded .
An important question is whether the " Origin : EU " label should be permitted as an added option .
The Commission thinks it should .
Many in Parliament believe that it is the country of origin that should be on the label .
The background to this is the food crises .
But I do not advocate scrapping the option of including " Origin : EU " on the label either .
In my opinion , we should choose another approach .
There are , of course , other means of enforcing compliance , but this method is far more direct .
Parliament has to keep an eye on compliance with the directives it produces .
If the producer prefers to indicate the country of origin nonetheless , this is possible too .
There are a number of additional arguments as to why " Origin : EU " labelling should be possible .
However , I would like to ask your attention for a question of principle .
The internal market is a large entity .
The principle of mutual recognition is fundamental .
This is unacceptable in my view .
All EU Member States need to guarantee safe meat .
We must put our own house , our own part of the world , in order .
If we are not ready , how can we expect others to be ?
Tomorrow , the European Union is preparing to outline a test programme for all Member States .
In this context , consumers would not understand the delays in the matter of labelling .
Let us make no mistake as to what is at issue here .
Finally , what our fellow citizens are demanding is the right to information .
Fortunately , integral chain control ( ICC ) is already well-known in many countries .
In my opinion , this is not related to national borders .
But it should not be an EU stipulation .
I would like to see not only the country but also the region of origin on the label .
I should like to see that go on the label .
I am also concerned about some of the words that might go on the label .
One of those words is " slaughtered " .
I wish we could find a new word for it .
Mr President , I wish to begin by saying that I welcome the report .
A European Union-wide identification system for cattle is long overdue .
I want to sound a note of caution .
No system is a hundred per cent perfect , so do not think you can bring that about .
There will always be people out to abuse the system .
That has been the case for centuries - and will continue .
I have a number of concerns .
The first is : who pays ?
It has not been borne by the retailer .
The consumer will perhaps ultimately pay - but he or she may not .
From that point of view it is expensive for those people .
I have one further question of the Commission .
Is it wise to renationalise the beef market ? Or even to regionalise it within countries .
I seriously question that point .
I challenge the Commission tonight to answer that question .
Is this a wise move ?
What is going to be the situation on the beef market ?
The proposal , as Mr Goodwill has said , has two important aims .
A further 18 proposed amendments were subsequently submitted for this plenary sitting .
The Commission is able to accept 18 of them .
However , I shall ensure that the Council is informed of your point of view .
This applies , for example , to proposed Amendment No 20 .
I would therefore suggest that you reconsider the simplified labelling system .
The Commission would therefore prefer not to adopt this proposal .
For the rest , recent discussions in the Council have gone in the same direction .
I am therefore convinced that these proposed amendments will be taken on board by the Council .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will be taken on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m.
( The sitting was closed at 12.10 a.m. )
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Mrs Ludford , are you sure your point of order is related to the Minutes ?
This judgement is important , not just for Europe ' s past , but also for its present .
Thank you , Mrs Ludford .
I am happy to take note of your point of order .
After that Members are free to move any other points of order .
In the end it was after 7 : 00 p.m. before Question Time started .
We had group meetings at the time and saw on the screen " Question 41 " .
Commissioner Byrne seems to have taken offence at this and seen it as some kind of snub .
Thank you , Mrs McKenna .
I take note of your comment and will ensure this does not happen again .
I would therefore ask the President to send our condolences to both the Romanian and Hungarian parliaments .
Thank you , Mrs Thors , I am quite prepared to do so .
Madam President , with rather more levity .
Could we find out why this has happened ?
It is so embarrassing .
Thank you , Mrs Laguiller .
I will give the letter my utmost attention .
The other request I have is for a technician to adjust the sound volume here .
Thank you , Mr Paasilinna , we will look into all that and check the sound system in general .
( The Minutes were approved )
Mr Ribeiro e Castro will present the motion .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , this report should not have been admitted .
Paragraph 15 of the motion for a resolution is a symptom of this aggressiveness towards Europe .
We are all attached to fundamental rights and the rule of law , starting here in this House .
So how can we agree when the fundamental right of recourse to the courts is being threatened ?
We are Members of this House and we represent our electors .
The very essence of Europe is under threat .
Paragraph 15 ruins the whole text by defiling a very serious issue .
Is there any better proof that this report is totally inappropriate ?
Thank you , Mr Ribeiro e Castro .
Does anyone wish to speak in favour of this request for referral back to committee ?
Thank you , Mr Berthu .
Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen , the two rapporteurs , wish to speak against this motion .
I call on Members to vote against this motion .
I am pleased about that ; it is a major step forward .
However , I also believe that the strong language my fellow delegates are using is completely uncalled for .
The EU countries have completely different cultures .
Some countries have a different system .
We have recital 15 .
Mr Dimitrakopoulos has already mentioned that there are amendments .
( Laughter and applause )
If you feel duty-bound to reject it , you will have an opportunity to do so .
( Parliament rejected the procedural motion )
The Intergovernmental Conference attempts to answer just that question .
The report you have before you today is significant in that it covers the following points .
The first point is once again to consolidate the institutional nature of the European Union .
For some , perhaps , that may be a risky proposal .
I refer very specifically to closer cooperation .
Closer cooperation , at least as we view it , must comprise two main elements .
None of them is currently operative .
Our first demand is therefore that qualified majority be established with the assent of the European Parliament .
The Court must be able to focus on the real legal issues and legal protection of EU subjects .
Sound and timely administration of justice is a vital component of the constitutional state .
Unfortunately , time constraints prevent me from going into any detail .
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets .
I have just hurried from a meeting which , according to the Treaty , does not exist .
This is precisely the point we have raised on behalf of the Committee on Budgets .
We have spent twelve years practising with a timetable set by the interinstitutional agreements .
Specifically , we must simplify the procedure in order to prevent the blocking of the budgetary procedure .
When there are 25 members , the current procedure will not work .
We should simplify it while respecting the existing balances of power .
I would like to raise two points .
So too , however , must be the role of Parliament .
My second point concerns energy .
In addition , the European Parliament powers must be adequately enhanced .
This means that the codecision procedure needs to apply to the EURATOM Treaty too .
So far , the Member States have had their own technical standards and regulations .
Unfortunately , my proposal to this effect has not been included in the current report .
We owe this to our citizens .
I believe that this results in satisfaction all round .
The second major point is the Union ' s legal personality .
There are nonetheless two points that are lacking .
I would like to finish off with a remark on the issue of the tax policy .
The report , in fact , mentions very little about this .
It is rather a pity , in my opinion , that we talk about it so little .
Maybe we will do so in future .
That does not , however , detract from the deep appreciation which we have for this report .
The EU is just as much a union of peoples as it is of states .
Close contact has been maintained with the Commission and the European Parliament .
This augurs well for the success of our work .
This is a truly historic moment , as has been stressed .
Its citizens therefore have both a European and a national identity .
Secondly , it is based on an institutional equilibrium between large and small states .
That must not be just on paper .
Anyone who ignores that is building a Europe founded on sand .
In this process Parliament ' s responsibility is very great indeed .
That is not a threat , it is a declaration of responsible attitude .
But is it enough for procedures to be simplified and speeded up for them to be described as effective ?
It is measured by the degree of legitimacy .
We support the main thrust of this report .
Liberals everywhere support ministers that will subscribe to the development of European parliamentary democracy .
Mr President , the European Parliament does not take part in Intergovernmental Conference negotiations .
It plays a secondary role , as do all those who are not part of a national government .
In this regard , we hope that our amendment will find consensus in the House .
The debate is how to go about European construction at the point of enlargement .
We must create a fully democratic institutional fabric .
We know that there are democratic deficits and that they are considerable .
The Intergovernmental Conference cannot end with the same disappointment that we had in Amsterdam .
We cannot create an Amsterdam 2 .
This is the great challenge for the European institutions and for European politics .
Mr President , Parliament does not take a corporate position .
It is not to trot out the old federalist recipes of the European Movement yet again .
We must adopt a more positive approach .
Asset stripping is a punishable offence .
Electoral power is being transferred from our constitutions , but is not being transferred to the European Parliament .
We parliamentarians have been side-tracked .
Power lies with the Commission and the Council of Ministers .
We do not have democracy in today ' s EU .
We should like to have it in tomorrow ' s .
We have different opinions as to how the laws should look .
The voters in our countries should always have the last word .
Join us in SOS Democracy .
We would like to make three points .
Secondly , the importance of transport .
Lastly , the role of tourism for both the economy and for employment .
I am making this statement as former rapporteur on the Maastricht Treaty .
Just try one of the pavement cafés and you will see what I mean .
I will repeat this to Mrs Frassoni in Italian some time .
As far as our Group is concerned , the resolution needs to be amended on a number of points .
One Commissioner per Member State seems a much better solution to us .
Our Group , too , has therefore tabled amendments to this effect .
Next is the number of MEPs .
The resolution argues in favour of the possibility of European lists .
It is important that we retain a maximum of 700 , with or without the European list .
The third point concerns the issue of unanimity .
We would also thank the Commission for this support .
I would like to end by commenting on the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
According to our Group , it is of paramount importance that this Charter be included in the Treaty .
This is a key issue for the citizens of Europe .
This debate is going on between political and national groups in different Member States .
Here were are all amongst small countries , especially given the challenge of globalisation .
I believe this should be an important element in our coexistence .
I have always been against the idea that we had to deal with the ' leftovers ' from Amsterdam .
Leftovers are thrown in the bin .
Here , the only risk involved in democracy is the risk taken in elections .
I believe that it is important for all of the institutions to confront this issue responsibly .
If not , the Intergovernmental Conference will not have been a success for our future .
Mr President , the EU is faced with enormous challenges .
The euro is to be introduced .
The Intergovernmental Conference should prepare the EU for these changes .
These are the questions which remain following the conclusion of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
We must all make sacrifices in order to achieve this goal .
Unfortunately , governments appear to have lost sight of this goal .
The talk is already of the next Intergovernmental Conference where the major questions will then be solved .
We have heard this before .
There is starting to be a surfeit of half-baked intergovernmental conferences .
Our citizens have higher expectations than that , and we do not have much time .
That is why we have to take the opportunity now .
Quite simply , the EU must become more liberal .
The challenges faced by the EU are exciting and historic .
They should inspire us all to roll up our shirt sleeves .
One might well ask what has become of political leadership and vision .
Their power would also be increased through the increase in their representation in the European Parliament .
This also shows how weak the democratic basis of such a Parliament would be .
As you have perhaps noted , I am going to vote against the present resolution .
( The President cut the speaker off )
I know that reform within the existing European institutions must take place .
However , any changes within the internal decision-making procedures must be balanced and fair .
I do not believe that this is a particularly sensible proposal .
380 million citizens of the Union have an affinity with the Commission .
The Union must draw nearer to the citizens of the Union .
I believe that national Member States should retain the right of veto on taxation matters .
The Irish taxation system is innovative in many ways and has contributed to our present growth rates .
After all , a house built on sand has no solid foundations .
This parable was meant as a reference to faith and its foundations .
Nonetheless , I was reminded of this parable during the IGC discussion .
The relentless attempts to turn Europe into a political unity seem to be built on quicksand .
This does not exist by any stretch of the imagination and is simply quicksand !
What do we want to achieve as a European Union ?
I would be keen to hear the Council ' s and Commission ' s opinion on this .
Another specific point I would like to raise concerns the European Commission .
This high official college should in future not have more or fewer than 20 members .
If necessary , combinations of countries can alternate in appointing a Euro Commissioner .
These are just some examples of the complex and controversial issues which are raised .
We are overloading the wish list of the IGC .
We believe the IGC should concentrate on the essential institutional reforms .
The President-in-Office addressed some of these concerns in his speech .
Some people say that this is the last opportunity for reform .
Our priority is enlargement .
We should not confuse or reverse our priorities .
Mr President , my group welcomes this report .
The Commission cannot go on expanding indefinitely .
So the report is balanced and I think can be welcomed .
It is ambitious .
Some people are saying : ' The IGC will never agree to this point or to that point ' .
That is essential for our future .
Mr President , the aim of the IGC is to reconcile enlargement with deepening .
Unanimity voting must apply to decisions of a constitutional and fundamental nature .
That applies in particular to the provisions on the composition and operation of the institutions .

Wallström , Commission .
I have the Council ' s common position of 9 December 1999 before me .
( Laughter , Applause )
Thank you , Mr Liese .
It is that very common position .
But I wanted to speak specifically on the vote on Amendment No 37 .
Mr Lannoye , the rapporteur discussed this question with the competent services yesterday .
He does not seem to agree with you .
I can only regret that .
After the vote on Amendments Nos 38 and 49 : President .
We will now adjourn the vote and resume after the formal sitting .
( The sitting was suspended at 12 noon for the formal sitting and resumed at 12.35 p.m. )
I would urge you to address this matter in the Bureau .
Does that not demonstrate what we were talking about and the point Mrs Roth-Behrendt has raised ?
There were eight votes to go .
I hope you could address that issue , Mr President .
I quite understand your feelings , Mr Bowe .
To tell the truth , I agree with you .
Mr President , I have a question about the method applied here .
Some Members had left the Chamber , others remained .
I had in fact announced that the voting would resume immediately after the formal sitting .
Moreover this was indicated in the Minutes and on the agenda .
But I too am sometimes faced with imponderables .
Let me assure you that all your comments will be passed on to the Bureau .
You yourself are a member of the Bureau .
I think that by taking concerted action we will manage to improve the system .
( Mixed reactions )
I propose to the President that we suspend the sitting for two minutes .
For it is unacceptable ...

Recommendation for second reading : Bowe ( A5-0083 / 2000 )
In any case , no one has ever succeeded in blocking the advance of science .
There are major issues at stake .
The argument has been made that this issue should instead be covered by horizontal legislation .
We must adopt an immediate and categorical ban on the use of antibiotic resistant genes .
This would mean that antibiotic-resistant products that have already been authorised would remain .
The pharmaceutical industry wants a total exemption from the directive .
Nothing of the kind has happened , however .
That tells us something .
I have never seen an insurer refuse to insure a non-existent risk .
The purpose of the three main amendments I support is as follows :
to prevent any accidental contamination of fields by cross-pollination between GMO and non-GMO crops .
So we must ban the release of all GMOs containing an antibiotic-resistant marker gene ;
to impose a strict liability system on producers .
Given the uncertainties that remain in this area , we must be as prudent as we can !
I want to issue this warning today .
Since 1998 , the Commission ' s proposals have been under discussion .
Further delays would be a mistake .
- ( SV ) It is an important report which Parliament has voted on today .
The Directive guarantees a high level of protection .
Nothing is so enduring as the accidental .
This will ensure that other species are protected .
Europe should stand up for the rights of the citizen and force industry to take responsibility .
Of course , the health and well-being of our citizens is of paramount importance .
I say no to the release of GMOs resistant to antibiotics .
We must not put our people or our animals at unnecessary risk .
Papayannakis report ( A5-0088 / 2000 )
Mr President , I voted for the measure on the labelling of beef .
Consumers need to have confidence in the food they eat .
Let us look back for a moment at the embargo on beef .
The Committee on the Environment amended important points of the Commission proposal .
It is high time we set up a reliable and transparent system .
Food safety is a top priority and we must work hard towards alleviating the fears of consumers .
This should allow for any possible health threats to be tackled early and effectively .
Public confidence in food safety has fallen tremendously in the past .
Lisbon European Council
When the European citizens grow old , all the governments abuse them .
- ( FR ) The Lisbon Summit was supposed to focus on a social Europe .
In short , everything should be quoted on the stock exchange .
And this was done with the complicity of all the left-wing governments present in Lisbon .
Employers , for their part , will once again enjoy quite indecent subsidies .
A new economy , but we are being served up the same old recipes again .
In addition , it will be capable of improving citizens ' quality of life and the environment .
The Lisbon Summit created enormous expectations .
If only these promises could be fulfilled .
We share these expectations but we should also like to be able to congratulate the practical results achieved .
On this score , only the future will tell .
Yet we already regret certain weaknesses .
These thoughts are reflected in our votes and the amendments tabled .
EU-Africa Summit in Cairo
Yet the EU persists in wanting to divide Africa between the Mediterranean area and black Africa .
That brings us to the end of the explanations of vote .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.25 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
She is not the leader of the majority and I must therefore register my protest .
Mr Ribeiro e Castro , your views will certainly be conveyed to the Council and to the President .
IGC ( continuation )
Madam President , tomorrow I am going to vote for the Dimitrakopoulos / Leinen report .
There is no point in denying anything in this case either .
This confusion will lead to conflict year after year .
Progressiveness cannot only be based on expenditure .
I am aware that these days are extremely tiring for all concerned , but duty comes before everything else .
I listened to Mr Segni ' s speech .
This is the real challenge .
Madam President , why is the gulf between the European Parliament and the European governments so wide ?
There is an excellent resolution on the table which refers to the many necessary reforms .
Cooperation should be more flexible and each Member State must retain a Commissioner .
They have contributed to a climate of Euroscepticism where there is no room for compromise .
As such , many European politicians are hostage to their own rhetoric .
We are the representatives of the people .
First number : 700 .
Second number : two thirds .
Two thirds of the vote is the majority required for our Parliament to censure the Commission .
This very high threshold of two thirds is a sad and unique case .
We must create a formal symmetry .
The people ' s representatives have the power to undo anything they have done .
That is the rule everywhere , and it must be the rule here too .
Third and last number : 2009 .
The report proposes the year 2009 as the date for electing MEPs from transnational lists .
Otherwise we would be being neither lucid nor ambitious enough .
In changing size , the European Union will change in nature .
So our continent will have to rethink its rules rather than simply tidy them up .
Over the centuries many attempts were made by some countries to dominate others .
We suffered centuries of war and even destruction and ruin on several occasions .
So what is different ?
We have a system based on mutual freedom for everyone , instead of supremacy for some .
We have a framework agreed between nations and not one imposed on the nations .
We therefore have a permanent contract between free and sovereign states which are all equal .
The price is patience , which is a small price to pay for such great results !
For Europe in general it would mean a crisis or breakdown .
We want an open Europe , not one tied in a straitjacket .
Finally , I must mention the idea of transnational European parties .
What a frightening idea of democracy !
This is because it covets power and ignores partnership and we cannot go down this road .
Only differentiation within the EU can create the preconditions necessary for enlargement on such a massive scale .
It is important that the report proposes that closer cooperation should be facilitated .
This would facilitate and speed up enlargement of the Union .
How can this Parliament , which represents all European citizens , rule out its own full legislative initiative ?
Here we attach the utmost importance to extending the scope of qualified majority voting .
But we have to acknowledge that undoubtedly we will also need this instrument .
Of course we can only be delighted at this .
Let me make one more point before concluding , Madam President .
It is most important to incorporate that Charter .
Madam President , this is a strange , uncomfortable and schizophrenic report .
How much of this schizoid quality reflects the positions of the two rapporteurs is hard to estimate .
That is the nature of democracy and democratic decisions .
It would be better to seek a compromise acceptable to all , as in the past .
It is a question of legitimacy and acceptability .
Secondly , Member States with a large population get more than their fair share .
The underlying principle of " one man - one vote " is unacceptable .
It is a question of equality and solidarity .
Equally , in the case of the Commission , let us avoid making numbers into an absolute principle .
Only a more politically realistic proposal will have a chance of being taken into consideration .
IGC 2000 is not the end of the story .
Europe is at a crossroads .
Madam President , I would first of all like to thank both rapporteurs .
We have held large public debates in the Netherlands and have done a great deal of groundwork .
The IGC should therefore make up the democratic shortfall .
Simply reducing a democratic deficit is not sufficient to improve contact with the citizen .
This is provided for in Amendment No 162 .
Another subject which is close to our hearts is that of making closer cooperation more flexible .
It is clear that the de facto veto , currently inherent in this procedure , must go .
We hope that this will receive support from this Parliament .
Madam President , enlargement is important for the people of Europe .
We must therefore find a way of cooperating throughout Europe .
The accession negotiations are now under way .
Both large and small States must be able to exercise influence in the future EU .
We must strike a balance .
This is necessary if our citizens are to have confidence in European cooperation .
All present Member States must be included and make their contribution .
I therefore recommend a system which takes account of differences in the size of the population .
It is important that each country should have a Member in the Commission .
The Commission must therefore be able to draw upon knowledge and experience from all the Member States .
The Member States do have different backgrounds where military alliances and neutrality are concerned .
It is therefore important that the Treaty should reflect the difference between civil and military cooperation .
Madam President , we have a very challenging task before us .
We have to strike a balance between efficiency , democracy and Member State equality .
We have seen that matters of taxation , for example , have become stumbling blocks .
At present , capital is like a dog off its leash .
We all have a lot to gain and protect in a common Europe .
We also have to cling to the notion of European solidarity for as long as possible in changing circumstances .
In my opinion , we need more than that .
In fact 12 Members voted for and 12 voted against .
Of the latter , 8 voted against and 4 abstained .
That is not something to be proud of .
With 6 Members it is materially impossible to follow up all the dossiers that are crucial to our country .
Moreover , we cannot sit on all the committees .
The idea of European lists is premature , if not hare-brained .
There can be no question of restricting unanimous Council voting to decisions of a constitutional nature .
I believe that our report is more serious .
I do not believe that the proposals which we make in this report are extravagant .
We fortunately have the opportunity to improve these points tomorrow in plenary .
I warmly congratulate the rapporteurs on their work .
My second point is directed at the President-in-Office .
Congratulations , Mr President-in-Office .
Comments were made about the Council ' s absence during the address by the Austrian President to this Parliament .
This point is very important .
And from that point of view , I want to thank the Council .
We are well aware that this equilibrium is both necessary and difficult to achieve .
In that regard , I share the concerns expressed by a number of speakers .
Opportunities must also be created to convince and speak to the national parliaments .
President Napolitano proposed the idea of an interparliamentary conference .
So we must take the time to reflect carefully about what we are doing .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Famine in Ethiopia
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the famine in Ethiopia .
These actions are very important and have been implemented in time .
The decisions were also taken at the right time .
We cannot separate from this issue the current political and military position in Ethiopia .
As I said , the European Union has been monitoring this situation .
There were representatives from ECHO , the Directorate-General for Development and the Member States of the European Union .
We are monitoring this issue .
It is a lethal mix .
It is capable of producing hunger and misery on a massive scale .
We face the same old frustrations , as I said in the Chamber yesterday .
So we improve our capacity to deal with the humanitarian problems in spite of the difficulties .
That is the frustration .
Let me set out for honourable Members what we are doing to alleviate the present crisis .
They will be making recommendations on our future efforts .
This amount is nearly covered by existing pledges by the international community .
The real figure is more than three times that .
That is the background .
It is important to be aware of it .
There have been a number of allegations about an inadequate European response to the crisis .
I hope that letter gets wider circulation .
It is important to remember that point .
What matters most is not to rake over these old controversies .
A further shipment of over 16 000 tonnes through EuronAid is due to arrive on Sunday .
This quantity should be sufficient to meet immediate needs .
So that is what we are doing .
We are also considering using the Port of Sudan .
They will have our unstinting assistance .
Who does one negotiate with in such a situation ?
Of course we must do everything in our power to alleviate famine .
We must watch the situation in Eritrea and balance humanitarian aid there , if required .
I recently spent a week in both Ethiopia and Eritrea .
When I was there they were pleading for help .
They were the lucky ones : they were the ones with food .
We never seem to learn a lesson from the past .
We must have action and we must have action decisively and urgently .
Madam President , I gladly concur with the previous speakers , Mr Patten and Mr Corrie .
We all witnessed the fight against hunger ten years ago .
The least both parties could do is to impose an absolute freeze on military activity .
Both have a great deal of logistical experience , expertise and know-how .
According to them , we are entirely to blame .
They are jointly responsible .
My second point concerns food .
There is enormous pressure to send food fast , and I mean fast .
Is there anything for sale locally in the region ?
It is not easy .
I give my full backing to any action undertaken by the Commission on this score .
Millions of people are again threatened with starvation .
This is not just caused by extreme drought .
The blinkered Ethiopian government , in particular , contributes through its obstinacy to the suffering of its own people .
We should nonetheless not lose hope .
Nature can only destroy where people fail .
After all , war and mismanagement are down to people .
Why do we still allow this to happen ?
Do we not have a conscience ?
So how can we be surprised at this situation ?
It is not true that we show solidarity .
I am not saying anything new .
When will we have a Marshall Plan for Africa ?
Yet we cannot relax .
The donors , including the European Union , are said not to have kept their promises .
Mr President , famine and Ethiopia : these are two words sadly etched in our memories .
The sound of guns has for far too long drowned out the cries of the hungry .
The cameramen left but misery and death did not leave Ethiopia .
Starvation and death continue today .
The population of Ethiopia pray for rain .
Sadly they see only a rain of bullets .
People crave water , food and medicine .
These politicians are hungry for power : politicians who argue over territorial boundaries whilst their people die .
Famine , disease and death remain the hallmarks of these countries .
Hunger for power must not be allowed to override the hunger for life .
Such help has been received with gratitude , but let us put it into perspective .
Sixteen million people are starving today ; 15 000 tonnes have been delivered .
I accept the difficulties of the logistics but that means less than a kilo per person .
These measures are palliative .
They only relieve the symptoms ; they do not cure the disease .
The summit between the European Union and the African countries was held just a few days ago .
Dialogue with the African authorities is essential , as is dialogue with the sub-regional authorities .
Thank you very much Minister .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday .
Stabilisation and association process for countries of South-Eastern Europe
I would like to make a general comment regarding the Conference .
Indeed , regional development is one of the Stability Pact ' s key points .
This concludes my general comments on the Funding Conference .
Further to this Conference , I would like to single out five key points from my report .
First of all , the funding .
Everyone was waiting with bated breath for the moment when the Commissioner would produce the amount .
He finally came up with EUR 530 million .
In the final analysis , therefore , there was little new money in it .
How are the preparations for the Stability Pact budget coming along ?
I am in favour of retaining the figure of 5.5 billion for the time being .
I am only very curious as to how the Commission hopes to raise all this money .
What is the progress here ?
What does the Commission intend to do to lift these unilateral trade restrictions in the short term ?
Fourthly , the NGOs .
Finally , the distribution of tasks .
Who will ensure that all these tasks are carried out promptly and efficiently ?
I would like to give the Commissioner a word of advice .
In my view , he has been given a leading role in the Balkans for no good reason .
The debate caused by this could not have come at a better time .
The European Union is by far the body which has contributed the most aid to this region .
The EU is furthermore the main trading partner of all the countries in this region .
The Stabilisation and Association Agreements constitute a central point of this policy .
I am not necessarily convinced that this is the most appropriate way of tackling the problem .
This has not been the EU ' s experience in equivalent regional processes in the past .
I should like to refer briefly to the new regulation .
Discussions are also ongoing about the possible extension of the EIB ' s activities .
Now is not the time to pass judgement past events and situations .
Here , however , we must pay attention to certain issues .
So what are these issues ?
So what are they ?
Firstly : absolute compliance with the UN ' s decisions on the area .
That would lead to continued and lasting tension with no foreseeable end .
A domino effect .
Thirdly : our policy must concern the peoples , and only them .
That is what is also in Europe ' s interests .
Fourthly : the issue of economic and institutional reconstruction is an urgent priority .
Positive results will emerge through development , democracy and prosperity .
The EU ' s political credibility and competence must prove successful .
It is a bet which must be won .
I do not , in fact , believe that the project will succeed if that does not happen .
In other words , it essentially accepts that the wolf can guard the sheep .
And the question is this : what principle of international law are they basing their actions on ?
It is precisely this cooperation which the European Union wishes to promote in the best possible way .
Well , this regional cooperation still leaves too much to be desired .
What is needed here is a powerful response from the European Union .
This should go hand in hand with a selfless and more balanced selection of regional aid projects .
Secondly , I consider Paragraph 26 in the Lagendijk report to be a fine idea .
Indeed , the Stability Pact applies just as much across the borders of the region .
Am I right in thinking that Russia already subscribes to the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe ?
Mr President , I will make three points .
I think that the donor conference makes this possible , or seems to at least .
In fact , it was once said that the Balkans begin at the Rennweg in Vienna .
We have first and second wave candidate countries .
I would , however , stress certain points .
Finally , I would like to mention two other points : the former Yugoslavia and crime .
The sooner we do this , the better .
It is causing serious harm .
And who can lift it if Europe does not ?
It appears that even the United States are expecting us to lift the embargo .
We must find the courage to take this step .
Then there is the issue of crime .
My country , Italy , has a very high organised crime rate .
Yet there was a great deal of similarity .
It is enormously important that we rise to the challenge in the Balkans .
We have to make that a real process for them .
The offers made by donors exceeded by a comfortable margin the expectations at the beginning of the conference .
There are a couple of points I want to make about it .
In my book , new money is money you have not spent already .
It is important to be clear about that .
This follows up the point made by Mr Swoboda and it is a point with which I strongly agree .
I want to make one or two other points which arose at Lisbon and which we are following up .
For agricultural products the figure is about 0.16 % .
So this is an area where we could afford to be a little generous .
We are also trying speed up our assistance and make it more effective .
I announced yesterday agreement in the Commission on a rapid reaction facility .
But that happened in some of those cities last winter .
The winter is over , so there is not the same urgent necessity for oil at the moment .
We are looking at ways to extend that sort of scheme .
I have spoken before of my concerns about Montenegro .
There will be other occasions when I can follow this up in greater detail .
This year we will be spending about EUR 540m in the western Balkans .
Year one is actually the big year of expenditure for us .
People say that is a crazy figure .
That could only start once Milosevic has gone .
The rest - EUR 3.2bn - over seven years does not strike me as being outlandishly generous .
I respond to the honourable Member ' s well-intentioned question in that way .
So let us see the cost of it in the Balkans .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m.
Question Time ( Council )
The next item is Question Time ( B5-0216 / 2000 ) . We will examine questions to the Council .
As they deal with the same subject , Questions Nos 1 , 2 and 3 will be taken together .
Question No 1 by ( H-0255 / 00 ) :
Question No 2 by ( H-0286 / 00 ) :
Question No 3 by ( H-0299 / 00 ) :
It will continue to monitor this situation in Turkey as it develops and to act accordingly .
These are a prerequisite for the opening of any negotiating process .
The preparation of this strategy involves non-governmental organisations , the Member States and the Turkish Government .
Clearly it is in this context that the issues mentioned in the questions will be considered .
They also told us that Turkey intends to take steps .
If anything , things are worse .
But no more !
We have come to believe it ourselves and we claim to represent the world-wide moral conscience .
Already , however , we have reached an impasse , and not just in Turkey .
But that cannot happen .
You see , Belgrade can be bombed , but not Moscow , Beijing or Ankara .
Let us therefore acknowledge the obvious and return to tried and tested prescriptions .
I am not sure that you have asked a question .
Mr Theonas wishes to rephrase his question .
I recommend to all of you that you begin with the question before making a declaration .
That was my comment .
In fact , quite the contrary is true .
It is this point which really must be borne in mind .
This is very clear to me .
For goodness sake !
I cannot make this any clearer .
Question No 4 by ( H-0294 / 00 ) :
These are clearly administrative issues .
Mr President-in-Office , I cannot say your answer is satisfactory .
If the Council were truly concerned about human rights one would have expected a more specific answer .
I would like to ask whether you can be more specific .
Is the Council going to take any specific action along those lines ?
Mr Alyssandrakis says that my answer was not positive enough .
It would be useful to remind him of his question .
I have no idea what more positive answer I could give him than to simply say yes .
Question No 5 by ( H-0262 / 00 ) :
What action will it take to defuse the crisis and tension in the region ?
Several Member States have also reinforced their own contingents in KFOR .
We are committed to the process of democratisation and coexistence in Kosovo .
Only responsibility-sharing by representatives of the minorities can lead to the construction of a multi-ethnic Kosovo .
I want to thank him for his answer .
I am not ignoring the major difficulties present on the ground in applying these decisions .
There is no point on this issue using euphemisms or diplomatic language .
We must consider what happened in the past which was the cause of all this .
Our only objective is to guarantee the continuation of multi-ethnic integration .
There is no point beating about the bush on this . This situation is unfair .
However , we must realise that the international community is doing its best .
Mr Alavanos said that until now all the questions we have heard have been Greek .
I believe that Lisbon , the ancient Olisipo , was founded by Ulysses .
The President-in-Office of the Council therefore comes from a country with a long tradition of Greek presence .
There just seems to be an ineffectual permissiveness of the situation despite all these wonderful , pious good intentions .
It was precisely the situation created in the Former Yugoslavia which caused this reaction .
You refer to the KLA .
In fact quite the contrary .
You say that the practical result of this action is not what was wanted .
We have made and are making efforts to achieve greater integration of the minority communities .
A more effective result has not been possible .
Question No 6 by ( H-0279 / 00 ) :
This mandate also includes the development of a phased economic recovery plan .
I have been waiting about six months for an answer on this .
What is hiding behind all that ?
If Mr Kouchner is not doing his job properly , what are you going to do about it ?
That does not happen anywhere , it is unreasonable .
The Council presidency has no knowledge of this issue .
There is a specific body responsible for this administration .
Each country is normally obliged to protect the actions of its undertakings within the international sphere .
The European Union is not a country .
Many entrepreneurs are naturally very bitter about this consequent stagnation in activity .
It is clear that the cost of recruiting staff is high .
The Union as such does not therefore have a specific and direct response to this type of question .
Question No 7 by ( H-0274 / 00 ) :
Coordination at European level would be conducive to the further development of the IT sector .
This too involves the principle of subsidiarity .
I want to thank the Council for its answer .
What happens in the future is important .
We do , of course , have shortcomings within the EU .
Is there not a need for a joint authority to coordinate this work ?
This is the answer to your first question .
This is a danger and risk to which we are alert .
They in fact consider that the structures which currently exist for monitoring this process are sufficient for this purpose .
Question No 9 by ( H-0275 / 00 ) :
Will the Council be taking due account of the specific contribution women can make to working for peace ?
In our opinion , this is not appropriate and the Council has made no proposal in this respect .
You have said that you are against quotas but in favour of references .
The European Union must be progressive .
Question No 10 by ( H-0276 / 00 ) :
The EU ' s framework programmes do not extend to the developing countries .
Mr President-in-Office , I thank you for this reply .
I would , however , like a brief answer that is clearer and more precise .
Do we then have a situation where the developing countries may now apply for funds ?
They were not able to before .
Question No 12 by ( H-0277 / 00 ) :
As soon as this becomes clear , we will announce this .
If these are to be included , this would only be confirmed during the French Presidency .
There are Member States in NATO and there are countries which are not in NATO .
In this respect , I can see no major problems .
We hope to ensure that all the various cultures which exist within the Union are compatible .
I would thank the Council .
I am nonetheless a little surprised at the answer .
Question No 13 by ( H-0283 / 00 ) :
It is intended to guarantee the sharing of common values .
The Union has no competence to intercede in the exercise of legal power by the Member States .
Therefore , the Council cannot interfere in the decision-making of the authorities .
Does this also apply to Turkey which has , of course , applied for membership ?
Mr Sjöstedt , the Member States undertake to act within the framework determined by the Treaty .
This is why they signed the Treaty .
The Union itself has ways of doing this but only in specific cases .
Thank you very much , Mr Seixas da Costa .
That concludes Questions to the Council .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.00 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
Address by Mr Klestil , President of the Republic of Austria
Financial services and complementary pensions
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
What is included in these measures ?
What is intended through these measures ?
Thirdly , granting the Commission broad powers of interpretation .
We could not agree more .
The consequence is that , in order for the market to function , these barriers must be removed .
Firstly , the barriers are not identified .
Secondly , the solution proposed by the Commission still raises difficulties .
With regard to the legal framework , I believe that there is a paradox in this sector .
The more liberalised an economy is , the more necessary it becomes to rigidly regulate the financial markets .
Comitology in these cases usually means taking away with one hand what is given with the other .
In this respect , I am in total agreement with the conclusions of the rapporteur .
Existing legislation , however , prohibits or hinders this type of cash management technique .
The world of banking has already driven this problem home to you on numerous occasions .
I would appreciate a reply to this .
Mr President , we see the reality of the situation all around us .
This is the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
That covers the general framework .
I now come to the report by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil .
The communication from the Commission is liberal-minded and forward-looking .
Why should Parliament now adopt a less liberal position and vote in favour of stagnating structures ?
The question of biometric risks has proved to be of a controversial nature .
Both form a pension scheme but focus on different competitive benefits .
But it should be determined individually by each employee , as the Commission proposes .
Leaving this kind of decision to the individual is consistent with the principle of subsidiarity .
The action plan aims to make the European market equal to the American market .
The success of the American market is basically due to ' king dollar ' .
John Kenneth Galbraith condemned the mistaken idea that there is any link between money and intelligence .
These are detrimental not only to companies but also , of course , to Europe ' s citizens .
This is an issue which can be resolved better at national level .
In committee there was lively discussion on biometric risks .
Freedom of choice is emphatically a good thing .
How matters will turn out , however , we do not know .
Supplementary assurances are therefore a problem .
We politicians ought to be putting our faith in a good , sound system of basic pensions .
It is now up to us to see that an acceptable document is produced tomorrow during the vote .
Unfortunately , the Commission has not really made any headway towards fulfilling this wish .
The first obstacle we need to negotiate is the mutual recognition of supervisory rules .
A pension fund has an obligation to be generally acceptable .
A full-value pension scheme covers biometric risks .
On account of this supervision , complete freedom of investment is justified in both cases .
This leads on average to higher returns .
The second obstacle is the levying of taxes within the Member States .
We are not talking about systems for financial investment but about pension plans .
The dynamic of growth and job creation has run its course .
The set pension fund strategy essentially aims to drain savings away toward the financial markets .
It has been radically changed , however , by the adoption of amendments unreservedly supporting the mechanisms of capitalisation .
I cannot , therefore , approve this report which makes the Commission ' s approach even worse .
The state scheme will of course remain the primary mechanism for basic provision in old age .
Mr President , this report seeks to harmonise supplementary pensions in Europe .
They fought for this right , which is based on intergenerational solidarity .
In several countries , powerful social movements have already opposed similar attempts .
Retired people need an adequate , stable and safe pension .
Pension funds and the stock exchange will never be able to guarantee that .
I think he deserves tribute for this .
This also includes small and medium-sized businesses .
Pension funds in the Netherlands are daring to take increasing risks in their investments .
If I were you , I would leave this to the Member States and the free market .
As for biometric risks , other speakers have already talked enough about this .
Referring to demographic changes in order to justify this is a swindle .
Unfortunately , we are forced to note that this is the case for the majority of Member States .
To this end , we need to develop a legal framework at European level at the earliest opportunity .
As such , this German person suffers a considerable handicap with regard to mobility .
Commissioner , you deal with taxes , what is the latest on this score ?
This , unfortunately , is at the expense of Member States which already have their house in order .
The supplementary pension scheme is based on collective feeling and solidarity .
The key word is " supplementary " pensions .
We are not trying to relieve poverty or provide a basic income in retirement .
The biometric risks problem means many different things to different people .
So the key is to keep it simple and make it work .
Shame on the Socialist governments for failing to provide for workers in their old age !
I think that we should differentiate between the two Kuckelkorns .
I believe that the systems we should pursue in Europe should be based on two principles .
I do not think that this is the right way forward .
We should keep intervention to a minimum .
I think that two issues still need tackling .
We also have a few specific proposals in this respect .
Firstly , we would propose the provision of better information on financial products for citizens .
Thirdly , we would propose better harmonisation for the present national consumer protection rules .
The fourth proposal concerns electronic commerce , or e-commerce for short .
Policy and legislation should make provision for e-commerce without creating unnecessary barriers .
Finally , an adequate supervisory structure is essential to guarantee the financial solvency of our institutions .
Does this mean that the European Central Bank in Frankfurt will be given a central supervisory role ?
The ECB itself is of the opinion that this is not necessary .
There is in fact an alternative , to wit , a coming together of supervisory systems .
At this juncture , Mr President , I would like to bring up a remark made by Mrs Randzio-Plath .
It is an important remark .
This is a very important matter .
The report will be made available shortly .
No doubt you will be able to find it on the Internet .
But how exactly can this be done ?
Nonetheless , we need to proceed faster in order to lay down the necessary rules .
Should we make more use of comitology procedures ?
Should more weight be given to agreement reached between the institutions upon first reading ?
In its communication on pensions , the Commission has included proposals on three fronts .
This is beyond dispute .
Mrs Peijs has asked me when we are getting mobile pensions for mobile people ?
So it requires the coordination of tax systems which differ in terms of tariffs .
This coordination is a precondition for cross-border labour mobility .
The desirability of this model was once again underlined this evening by Mr Blokland , among others .
Mr Blokland pointed this out and I share his view on this .
This is also echoed in the motion for a resolution .
These standards will differ in certain aspects according to the risks actually covered by the institutions .
I believe that this is not right .
This freedom remains .
Adequate supervision is crucial , as is liberalising the scope of pension funds .
I have been waiting for a reply for one and a half hours now .
This is not such a bad thing , in my opinion .
It is true that small and medium-sized businesses are facing obstacles in their cross-border activities .
The Commission is acutely aware of this .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Strategy for Europe ' s Internal Market
That has been my criterion for recommending a vote in favour of the amendments presented in this House .
What was that message ?
If you will allow me , Mr President , I will concentrate on three ideas .
What does the internal market mean to European construction ?
The internal market appears to have become very small in this new globalised economy .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
This document on the strategy for the internal market expresses this very clearly .
The internal market is Europe ' s platform in the world .
That is the first message of the Committee on Legal Affairs .
These must be the great pillars upon which this strategy for the internal market is built .
We will not make the headlines with this , but it is important nonetheless .
We must oppose procedures which are used too frequently , such as ' gold plating ' .
We ask that infringement cases be processed more quickly and that they be more effectively presented to the citizen .
Lastly , the third message is a change in the business culture in Europe .
We need businesspeople who are more willing to take risks .
We need to put the emphasis on the creation of a genuine capital risk market .
A proportion of its content affects the competences of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
It is these points which I wish to discuss specifically .
This new version does contain specific measures and proposals .
Let us then analyse the content of these proposals , albeit in general terms .
An example of this can be found in an area as apparently banal as urban transport .
Liberalisation presents other difficulties .
Social protection in a single internal market cannot simply be left to subsidiarity .
Lastly , cohesion also seems to me to be important .
The lack of action is related to the original conception of this policy .
I want to focus on a couple of the principal points that she makes .
The first one is the need to address , within the Union , the impact of legislation on business .
It needs to be an integral part of the policy and regulation process .
We were delighted to see a second point on the agenda at Lisbon .
I can assure them that we will vigorously oppose that tomorrow .
I invite colleagues to reject that proposal .
I hope that is appreciated .
I hope it will demonstrate that we are prepared to work with speed .
I hope that , together , we can really make the internal market work as quickly as possible .
I would like to highlight some of these points .
Back to basics should be our motto .
The e-Europe initiative praises the use and expertise of Internet and multimedia .
Finally , I can only echo the need for SLIM .
Legislation must become simpler and must be written in a clear language .
Superfluous legislation should be withdrawn .
It would therefore be beneficial to draw up a scoreboard of laws which have been abolished .
Mr President , I would like to speak on a point of order .
If I am not mistaken , Mr Harbour said that he was opposed to our amendment .
I believe that there has been a little confusion .
In the Spanish version which I have there is no problem .
I imagine that in the English text which Mr Harbour has there is no problem either .
Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi has mentioned three topics .
Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi ' s second remark highlights a number of inconsistencies .
According to her , sometimes one does not know where one stands .
This would be a serious shortcoming if it were true to this extent .
If this were the case , then the Commission would be more than happy to rectify this situation .
Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi ' s third remark concerns the change in culture .
I happen to disagree with these critics .
Responsibility lies with both camps .
What the Commission is trying to bring about is already so hard to achieve .
It also concerns the taxation package formulated by my predecessor , Mr Monti .
I would like to oppose such reasoning which has no foundations in the real world .
This would not be the right attitude , in my opinion .
I ask Mr Berenguer Fuster if he would like the Commission to have yet more political courage ?
We are already struggling to achieve what we have proposed .
And he is right , of course .
I would now like to comment on a remark made by Mr Medina Ortega .
He said that at present , there is a risk of state monopolies being replaced by private monopolies .
Replacing a state monopoly by a private monopoly only makes matters worse .
This is certainly not the intention of this Commission .
This is , of course , directly reflected in the cost .
This could not be further from the truth .
The internal market is far from complete .
Mrs Berger was right to refer to directives which remain in the Council .
Let us hope that this will change .
We are all waiting for this moment .
Mr President , this concludes my remarks .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
2001 : European Year of Languages
On behalf of the Group , I can recommend supporting this programme .
We are all convinced of the usefulness of this exercise , of course .
This is a terrible observation to have to make .
I would also add our own mother tongue to the equation .
I repeat , 75 000 English words derive from classical Greek .
It is also certain that Latin is just as important for most European languages .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the rapporteur .
The European Year of Languages is important and worthwhile .
All the languages of Europe are equally valuable and worthy of respect in terms of culture .
It could be said that the people who speak the same language share the same mentality .
Language is the most peaceful way of communicating .
Independence is language and language is independence .
The Kurds are a nation with no land or borders of their own , kept together only by language .
Language is a powerful force .
It is the most important bond for a nation .
Large countries , and many smaller ones too , often tyrannise others through language .
It is a means of occupation .
The legislation regarding language in my country is among the most liberal in the world .
That is why we have guaranteed the important status of minority languages .
The multilingual nature of the European Union is thus a source of wealth .
At the same time it is also the right of each citizen in each Member State .
The multilingual nature of Europe must be preserved after enlargement too ; there are no obstacles to this .
It is wrong to think that a multilingual environment is costly and ineffective .
However , I would also like to express certain concerns with regard to the economic restrictions .
I am referring , for example , to Ladino and Yiddish .
These languages furthermore do not have any media of their own .
What better rapporteur could there be ?
Now it tends to be English .
So what are we to tell our fellow citizens for this year 2001 .
Let me just briefly mention a few points .
Firstly , that European unity may not mean linguistic unity .
Next , that every language is deserving of respect and deserves to be promoted and defended .
And then , all languages are learnt within the family first of all .
It is up to us to construct this dialectic of European unity and its linguistic diversity .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
This report had a long gestation period .
We also have more money in the programme in recognition of its importance .
We will always ask for more money .
The budget is not enough .
It is perhaps Parliament ' s role to ask for more .
But we can be pleased with the outcome .
We are delighted that some candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe will benefit as well .
We can be pleased with our efforts and pleased with this report .
It will also lead to understanding of the cultural and linguistic diversity within the European Union .
I would recommend that we support this programme .
Mr President , I also commend the report and thank Mrs Gröner for the excellent effort she has made .
It is a very good report .
Youth is the sector in our Community that is so often ignored .
We hope that imbalance will be redressed .
I hope that does not happen .
We should include the best parts of those excellent initiatives in whatever programme we formulate in future .
The new Youth Programme emphasises the developing links with the youth of entrant countries .
That is an excellent initiative .
The bridges built between youth will be the bridges that eventually unite Europe .
The agreement to constantly review the situation is an initiative that I welcome .
What more deserving cause could there be than supporting youth in the European Union .
I offer them my thanks for their work .
I would like to reassure all Members who have spoken about possible sanctions .
The programme has ambitious objectives , which are essential to the development of the idea of European citizenship .
Mr President , I wish to take this opportunity to talk about the youth policy of the future .
In fact , I stood before you for the first time last September .
I spoke of the White Paper on the European Union ' s youth policy , which is a priority .
Lastly , I would like to include the European Parliament in this exercise .
Ladies and gentlemen , there is a considerable amount of work to be done , but it is exciting .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
( The sitting was closed at 12.45 a.m. )
Principles for recording taxes and social contributions
This is a serious issue which has been debated .
I would also add that there is no other accounting method which would correctly record revenue in a budget .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to ask you , and also the Commission , for your help .
The PPE-DE Group agrees with the Commission proposal in this regard .
Two questions still remain , however .
The Member States also need time to adjust to new rules .
Obviously , this juggling of accounts will not be possible if the Commission ' s proposal is approved .
It is not a question of revising now what was done in the past .
Ladies and gentlemen , what is done is done .
Ladies and gentlemen , if rigour in accounting is demanded , it should be so from the outset .
This change is a complicated change .
Secondly , this profound and complex change must be done in a gradual way .
As Mrs Thyssen has pointed out , changing and adapting the accounting rules requires a certain amount of time .
We are being asked to change a regulation which entered into force a few months ago .
The PPE-DE ' s amendment asks for the change to be introduced gradually .
This is certainly a step forward .
It seems logical to use the revenue collected as the basis for determining the actual percentage deficit .
Overall , this is a useful step forward .
I welcome the commitment of the Commission .
There is a ninth amendment , presented later , which I will also comment on .
The Commission would prefer not to maintain Amendments Nos 4 , 5 and 6 .
The aim of these amendments differs from that of the regulation .
We hope that this approach will lead to a resolution of the problem raised .
We are therefore talking about a technical problem , of not having the capacity to provide data .
This is the reason why the Commission does not consider Amendment No 9 to be acceptable .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
COM in bananas
The stakes are high .
Since 1993 , the position of the Community producers has been constantly deteriorating .
The same applies to many ACP countries , traditional suppliers .
We need to know what our objectives are .
As I see it , the first priority is to defend the European model at the international level .
That is certainly the position the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development unanimously adopted .
Why should it be any different for bananas ?
So on this issue - I know - the Commission ' s task is not an easy one .
Of course , the ACP countries know they must adapt to world trade .
But let us give them time .
They will then become competitive .
I take comfort in the fact that I am not the only one .
It seems that the Council cannot easily accept it . Parliament does not like it either .
What is even more serious however is that not even the United States like it .
After bananas , will other sectors fall ?
When will we stop protecting Austrian white wines , for example , ?
This clearly remains an open question within the WTO .
I would like to express my concern regarding the consequences of Mr Dary ' s report for trade policy .
This , meanwhile , would have very serious consequences for the whole of European agriculture .
We need stability for European and ACP banana producers and EU consumers .
That can be done by rejecting this report and supporting the Commission 's compromise proposal .
I would therefore , Mr President , like to offer my heartfelt congratulations to Mr Dary .
We support his report .
He has been generous with the amendments of the different political groups .
So they represent an essential element in the balance of the economic and social fabric of these fragile territories .
We are giving the United States a marvellous present there !
Well , it is not enough !
The United States wants more .
Technically , what does it want ?
What is Europe doing to face that challenge ?
It is divided and getting bogged down .
We are divided from our German friends .
But we are also getting bogged down in technical proposals .
We could undoubtedly challenge that , and our excellent rapporteur , Mr Dary , does challenge it .
He proposes that the respite of six years be extended to ten years .
Another four years , Mr American executioner !
And we have tabled amendments too .
Well , all that is very fine , but the battle is elsewhere .
The battle is for Community preference , first and foremost .
We have to choose : either the Canaries , Madeira and the Antilles - or Chiquita .
It is regional policy that is at stake .
It is cooperation policy that is at stake .
We have to choose : either Africa and the Lomé Convention , or the WTO .
When the United States alters its policy , we will discuss the mere 191 million for bananas .
In the meantime , we need long , global , political negotiations .
We must talk about Iraq , Echelon , Serbia ; put everything on the table .
Sanction for sanction , retaliation for retaliation .
The banana is a moment of truth . Europe can either surrender or stand up and be counted .
There is a saying that bananas can be eaten from both ends .
Does Europe want to stand up or be eaten from both ends ?
The EU has not exactly covered itself in glory in this almost endless debate .
This is an area where some Member States are indulging in protectionism at the expense of others .
The reason for that is simple .
Community regulations on bananas were modified to comply with that decision .
The second refers to the incompatibility of the exemption in favour of ACP countries within the Community system .
We ourselves also have to observe the rules that we signed up to when the WTO was founded .
This will protect the essential interests of the ACP producer countries .
The arrangements for EU banana producers are not as good as they might be .
There is still a need for a political compromise here .
Therefore , we cannot afford to be condemned like this again .
That is not easy , but the present system is untenable .
We must , therefore , urgently find and accept a compromise and a more liberal attitude .
Surely it is unacceptable to be applying two different sets of criteria .
Is the Commission not guilty of double standards here ?
Are bananas the poor relation of agricultural production in the European Union ?
Is there also a plan to liberalise trade in meat , milk and cereals ?
That will lead to poverty and even more deprivation .
Yes , we have to simplify the system .
It is far too complicated at the moment .
Their access to the market has not gone down since 1993 .
All they want to do is get more access to the market at the expense of the ACP countries .
Yes , we have to find a solution .
Producers in the UK are being held to ransom by the USA .
We must not let ACP countries go to the wall just to save companies in the EU .
The challenge should be to reform the WTO .
The Seattle Summit and the huge public demonstrations made the need plain .
This should be the European Union ' s policy .
Mr President , I speak from three perspectives .
I regret various aspects of this Dary report .
I have to say that this timescale of ten years is wholly unrealistic and unreasonable .
I regret the attempt to cling on to quotas and to interfere with trade in that way .
That is essential .
I support the Commissioner 's efforts .
He has a difficult task .
I have in mind above all Amendments Nos 33 and 34 .
Amendment No 33 calls for financial support for ecologically sound farming in third countries also .
That is the official position .
Nor does the Commission ' s proposal comply with our international commitments .
This is not the time to fail to take account of this House .
I would like to give my reasons for this rejection area by area .
The second important area is the issue of managing tariff quotas .
That really would be demanding the impossible .
A higher preference would also lead to renewed attacks in the WTO .
I shall now turn to the special support measures for our own producers in the European Union .
The final ruling does not affect our intra-Community support system .
My last point is about measures giving equal access to organic and fair trade bananas .
Measures to support sales of organic bananas can be financed under national and regional programmes .
The Commission is grateful for the wide-ranging discussions that have taken place here today .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
I shall suspend the sitting until the President arrives .
( The sitting was suspended at 11.25 a.m. and resumed at 11.30 a.m. )
Madam President , Mr Barón Crespo , Chairman of the Socialist Group , also directed a comment to me .
Almost every member of the committee spoke on this .
That is why I tabled this amendment .
Is that correct ?
on Amendment No 5
After the vote on Amendment No 5
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
before the vote
Yes , I am afraid that will delay our work a little , Mrs Frahm .
I will try to be as clear as possible in taking the votes .
( Parliament adopted the two resolutions and three decisions in successive votes )
( Parliament adopted the two decisions and the resolution in successive votes )
before the vote
These amendments make reference to the Secretary-General .
Mr van Hulten , as President , I take responsibility for declaring these amendments admissible .
I am not expressing an opinion on their content .
Parliament has not yet voted on them .
The problem facing me is whether they are admissible or not .
If they are voted through they will obviously be implemented , like everything else we vote for .
on Amendment No 4
on Amendment No 1 from the Greens / ALE Group
If we were to accept this , we would be contradicting a paragraph that we agreed earlier .
We do not want a list of measures , that can come later .
There is nothing contradictory at all about this .
( Parliament adopted the decision )
( Parliament adopted the decision and the resolution in successive votes )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
on compromise Amendment No 224
Presumably the English version is " more proportional " .
We cannot accept that word .
Thank you , Mr Corbett .
But I have to apply the rules .
A compromise amendment has been put before me .
Madam President , we would like to keep the compromise amendment .
I put the question to Parliament .
Are there any objections to our putting this compromise amendment to the vote ?
I thought that was the case .
Madam President , I think it is fair that it be put to the vote .
If it is rejected , we can then switch to the rules suggested by Mr Corbett .
That is the simplest approach .
Excuse me , Mr Brok , Rule 130 of the Rules of Procedure is very clear .
I am only following the Rules , just as I should .
( Parliament decided not to put the compromise amendment to the vote )
on Amendment No 118 from the Greens / ALE Group
We established our voting lists in favour of this amendment on the basis of the French version .
Madam President , the French text takes precedence .
Right , thank you for making that clear .
on compromise Amendment No 227
Madam President , your services were informed yesterday that we would not sign this compromise amendment .
on Amendment No 174 from the PPE Group
Are you withdrawing this amendment , in which case we will hold a split vote on paragraph 29 ?
Is that right , Mr Brok ?
So it would be easier to do that here .
Is that right ?
Madam President , I have the highest regard for Elmar Brok , but in this case he is mistaken .
That is the old text .
We cannot split this again now .
If the amendments are withdrawn , I will take the vote on the original text .
Mr Dimitrakopoulos , if you would like to present your oral amendment , Parliament will decide .
Madam President , the oral amendment consists of adding the word ' continuing ' to the second part .
That is clear .
Are there any objections to putting this oral amendment to the vote ?
It is not really in order with our normal procedure .
Are there twelve Members against putting this oral amendment to the vote ?
( More than twelve Members rose to oppose the vote on the oral amendment )
Madam President , I must refute what Mr Brok said .
I proposed a solution in both cases .
In this case , we informed your services yesterday that we would not be signing that compromise amendment .
Thus , it should never have been tabled in our name .
before the final vote
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
I warmly congratulate our two rapporteurs , Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen .
( Loud applause )
By way of explanation , consider the following quotes :
We chose to abstain and this requires explanation .
We think not .
We are against such an approach .
So we have chosen to abstain .
This is a motivated abstention rather than an indifferent one .
By that vote , Members have reaffirmed that only the rapporteur is responsible for the explanatory statement .
Kuhne Report ( A5-0097 / 2000 )
Dimitrakopoulos / Leinen Report ( A5-0086 / 2000 )
That is clear .
We have put a large number of suggestions on the table .
Clearly , not all of them will be taken up in the form which this Parliament has advocated .
But we know that .
I am confident that we can do that .
We were very near to a compromise agreement .
We should be able to crack this one .
Mr President , I have voted against this report .
I say this with regret .
I believe that this Parliament is sending a confused message to the Intergovernmental Conference through this resolution .
For all these reasons , I regret , once again , to say that I have voted against .
We find three points in this report particularly harmful .
The necessary but unacknowledged counterpart of all these measures is the marginalisation of the national democracies .
Why not a European Parliament of 1000 Members ?
It could work in variable geometry formations and its originality would have a powerful impact on the imagination .
Mr President , I shall endeavour to explain myself clearly .
I voted against this report and I was not alone in doing so .
We did so with conviction on behalf of the European regionalists of the ALE .
This agenda is , of course , too restricted .
We therefore hope that the IGC will prove successful in getting vigorous reform under way .
It is the big States which are obtaining more power , those and the central institutions .
There is nothing of this , however .
I have therefore voted against .
This is not in the interest of the ordinary people of Europe .
This is why I voted for this amendment .
We should make sure we do not have procedures like this in plenary in future !
And I am quite sure the IGC will not retain the current wording of paragraph 32 .
Mr President , I voted for the Dimitrakopoulos report , although I do have some reservations about it .
I am enough of a realist to know that this is a gradual process .
It was difficult for me to support the resolution because it mixes the worst in with the best .
Is that really a very sensible position for a Parliament to take ?
We further protest against the report 's advocacy of the militarisation of the EU .
It is especially important that this matter be discussed on an on-going basis with Europe ' s citizens .
All Member States must demonstrate the political will to make cooperation work .
In parallel with the IGC , the Member States are discussing a common European security and defence policy .
We continue to believe that the EU should not be an actual defence alliance .
Also in parallel with the IGC , the creation of a Charter of Fundamental Rights is being debated .
The aim of the present Intergovernmental Conference is to prepare the EU for this enlargement .
If enlargement is to be implemented successfully , certain institutional changes are required .
The report on the Intergovernmental Conference is the European Parliament ' s contribution to that conference .
The role of the European Parliament is to represent the people in the Union .
Enlargement means more States ' representatives in Parliament .
We advocate a ceiling of 700 Members of the European Parliament .
We believe that each Member State should have a Member in the Commission .
In that way , the legitimacy of the Commission would also be strengthened .
Closer cooperation between at least a third of the Member States cannot apply in the case of defence cooperation .
The Member States have different backgrounds where military alliances and neutrality are concerned .
It is therefore important that the Treaty should reflect the difference between civilian and military cooperation .
We are not prepared to dispense with the veto in regard to military cooperation .
- The agenda of the IGC has now been set by the Member States .
Why is the role of national parliaments being eroded by substantially limiting democratic scrutiny ?
It imposes forced privatisation .
That is why we have voted against this report .
Unanimity cannot be limited to constitutional decisions .
Through these excesses a majority of this Parliament has done Europe a disservice .
, in writing .
Too many parallel concentric circles create a system which is difficult to supervise .
- While not able to endorse every dot and comma of this report , I support its broad thrust .
A Union unable to make decisions would not serve the purpose of existing or applicant states .
we must limit the number of Commissioners so that the Union 's executive remains efficient
and we must limit the number of MEPs to 700 to enable Parliament to function effectively .
As usual , it is going all out for an unfettered federalist approach .
However , this report also proposes new and unacceptable ideas .
We are , of course , opposed to such ideas .
The European Parliament could demonstrate its worth by adopting these policies .
We will therefore be voting against the report .
- The complexity of the IGC process inevitably requires a complex response from the European Parliament .
1 ) There ought to be one Commissioner per Member State ( paragraph 10 ) .
This is about the Commission ' s legitimacy and future and about its being able to claim popular support .
The Intergovernmental Conference must now give consideration to Parliament ' s constructive proposals .
That concludes the vote .
( The sitting was suspended at 2.02 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
I do not remember Mr Berlusconi being present .
Topical and Urgent Debate
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
Mr President , it is very important to point out that sanctions are themselves a form of warfare .
Over 200 children die there every single day .
This is not acceptable .
We cannot allow this to go on .
Can we allow this to go on without saying something about it ?
It is a blatant violation of international human rights laws .
It is the ordinary people who suffer .
We cannot allow this to go on .
We also have to address the bombings that are taking place without any UN mandate .
That is absolutely unacceptable .
A whole family was wiped out by these bombings , as shown in Mr Pilger 's documentary .
This is something we cannot ignore and we must push for an end to this inhumane policy .
The facts have been presented by respected international bodies such as UNICEF .
We have no reason whatsoever to doubt their veracity .
We must concentrate our efforts on convincing Iraq to implement the United Nations resolutions .
The European Parliament must not be seen to undermine the legitimacy of such resolutions in any way .
Any such action would be grist to the propaganda mill of the Iraqi regime .
It is within the power of the regime to have the sanctions imposed by the United Nations lifted .
I too have met some of these people .
I have shared their suffering with them .
Let us clearly understand that is a tragedy in itself .
We are caught between a rock and a hard place .
Civilians , men , women and children are dying because of the sanctions .
But what a contradiction . What a tragedy .
I feel that we must then act in order to give practical effect to our resolution .
And that is essential .
This is important for all of us .
There is still bombing in the North and in the South .
There are no books .
There are schools but there is no paper .
There are doctors , but there is no medicine .
There are hospitals , but there is nothing inside them .
It is perverse .
They were promised food in exchange for oil .
But they are asked to practically give their oil away and then buy food .
Ladies and gentlemen - especially Members who are not here - by what right is this happening ?
Do not keep silent !
Do not be accomplices !
UN officials are resigning .
Let Washington ' s Nebuchadnezzar let these people go , these slaves in their own country .
They must be released from this poverty .
I appeal to your consciences !
Europe is denying itself !
There is no time to lose ; this people could cease to exist .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I ask you to act quickly .
We have committed ourselves to ask for the immediate lifting of sanctions .
We certainly cannot continue to accept this situation .
And here I differ slightly from Mr Collins .
Remember , the Iraqi people are innocent .
He decided to resign .
It must be remembered that the rules of war involve respect for civilians .
That is also one of the great principles of Western civilisation !
Mr President , our resolution is very consistent .
For once , Europe must speak with a European voice !
I had the opportunity to visit Iraq last month .
I met the families of the Kuwaiti prisoners .
Mr President , the Commission shares the concern expressed during this debate .
In this regard , we agree with the draft resolution .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place this afternoon at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
I believe that the territorial integrity and sovereignty of every country is an inviolable and fundamental principle .
However , for several months a war has been raging in Chechnya which none of these arguments can justify .
In the long term , this is the only way to remove this focus of conflict .
Mary Robinson obtained limited access .
Domestic affairs can never be pleaded as an excuse for atrocities of this kind .
We have a global responsibility to defend basic rights .
We presume that Russia will be of assistance and allow the delegation to travel freely .
This illustrates that there are various movements within Chechnya .
The other two groupings seek more of a political solution .
We are pleased to hear that Maskadov does not support the actions of his military .
We have also noted hat the Council of Europe has adopted a position in this regard .
What is a proportionate use of force in a case such as Chechnya ?
What proportion are we talking about ?
This is unacceptable .
What is meant by lessening the intensity of the conflict in Chechnya ?
Perhaps stopping the massacre of women and children ?
Perhaps stopping the bombing of hospitals ?
Please explain this to us .
There is no such thing as internal affairs in this world we want to build .
Either we have human rights or we do not have human rights .
Let there be no mistake , we should not let Mr Putin get away with that .
This joint delegation needs to set off without delay .
It would be a great step forward if this succeeded .
That is what we should condemn .
That is why I think it is important that this interparliamentary delegation exists .
Mr President , once again we are discussing the situation in Chechnya .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place this afternoon at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
Jewish prisoners in Iran
Jewish prisoners in Iran
Mr President , what is the purpose of this joint resolution ?
What fundamental objections are we actually raising against the judicial action taken by the Iranian authorities ?
To start with , a variety of scarcely plausible accusations have been levelled at the accused .
The latest accusation was scarcely credible to the orthodox Jewish community in Shiraz .
And so these thirteen Jews are being threatened with the death penalty .
And remember , this has been the case for over a year as they were arrested in March 1999 .
Our amendment in paragraph 5 is based on this very consideration .
In short , this addition does nothing to support the case of the thirteen Jews from Shiraz .
God willing , that is what we shall see !
The trial is taking place behind closed doors .
These people have been in prison for months under conditions we know virtually nothing about .
There is no guarantee of the right to a defence .
I am afraid this may only be a mock trial .
Yet the charge is so serious it could lead to the death penalty .
But some of the accused are still facing the death penalty and the others face heavy sentences .
The government ' s various changes of attitude illustrate their embarrassment very well .
They were incapable of stating the charges clearly until the very last minute .
So it is imperative that we react .
We must also call on the Union governments to do the same .
Today , a new trial is starting in Shiraz , in the South .
The youngest is only sixteen years old .
When the more moderate elements won the last elections , we thought our call had been heard .
In other words , we are disappointed , disappointed and alarmed .
There is no such thing as an internal matter where human rights are involved .
Our feelings are as strong as our concern .
We must make ourselves perfectly clear .
We hope the Council and the Commission will rally unequivocally to our position .
We must remain intransigent on this point - human rights are not negotiable .
They were put on trial for it and hanged .
Who are the accused ?
It is hard to understand how these people are endangering Iranian democracy .
What are they supposed to have done ?
No one really knows !
We do not have the right to know what they are supposed to have done .
A letter to a family in Israel may have been enough to set this case in motion .
That was refused .
That was also refused .
Up to now that has been refused .
I agree with all the previous speakers .
The youngest is sixteen years old and the oldest forty eight .
The reason : espionage .
Yet again .
Requests have been made to send letters , but to no avail .
They are Hebrew teachers and perform religious rituals , among other things .
The Jewish communities are afraid .
What is likely to happen ?
It is very worrying and must be followed up .
In addition , these 13 were all religious leaders or leaders of the Jewish community .
Let us send our message very clearly from this Chamber .
Mr President , Turkey is now standing at a crossroads .
Akin Birdal has now been imprisoned for such a statement , in spite of his ill-health .
We must say to the Turkish Government that the policy which the country is conducting belongs to the past .
Such a country will never achieve the unity which it desires .
My advice to Turkey must be : choose the future and free Akin Birdal and his colleagues .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party supported this proposal .
We hope that we shall one day be able to welcome Turkey into the Community .
We believe that this message gives an important signal to the Turkish people .
Many of us had hoped for improvements in this area .
He had scarcely received a just trial and had been sentenced on flimsy grounds .
He must be released immediately .
In the EU , we are proud not merely to be an economic club .
Unfortunately , Turkey still has a long way to go .
At any rate , that is my interpretation of minority rights .
These were his words to us then : " For five months we have had a new Turkey .
Those were Akin Birdal ' s words .
Akin Birdal was free at just that particular time because of what was termed ' ill health ' .
However , he would shortly be forced to return to prison if he were too healthy .
He also , of course , forfeited the right to be chairman of the Human Rights Foundation .
Akin Birdal is a gentle and peaceful man .
He still suffers from the after-effects of the attempt upon his life in the spring of 1998 .
It is real provocation .
Through this kind of action Turkey alienates itself from Europe .
The gulf becomes deeper instead of the other way round .
In the meantime we also know from incidents in Belgium who is really behind this .
Akin Birdal is not a Kurd .
No one who has met him could forget his smile and gentle nature .
And yet he has had to endure great suffering .
Leyla Azan is still in prison , and so are thousands of Kurds .
When will this end ?
There is no justification for the behaviour of the Turkish Government .
The European Union cannot continue to turn a blind eye .
People are being mercilessly persecuted , and religious freedom and freedom of speech are being curbed .
Tibet ' s culture and identity are being systematically obliterated .
These continual violations of the most fundamental human rights must now become an issue .
My own group , the Group of the European People 's Party , is firmly convinced of this .
Commissioner Lamy , Europe needs to stick its head above the parapet .
Point one : Tibet must become a peace zone .
Point two : China must finally renounce its policy of expulsion .
Point three : democratic civil rights must be guaranteed for all minorities .
Point four : Tibet ' s culture and environment must be protected .
Point five : genuine negotiations must take place on Tibet ' s future autonomous status .
How did a Tibetan delegate put it ?
" We will survive because of your moral support , but above all because of your solidarity " !
Tashi delek !
Eight years ago I was rapporteur on Tibet .
Nature and the environment are being polluted and damaged to an extent never seen before .
Mr Mann has made it unnecessary for me to reiterate this .
A great many people are involved here .
The fundamental right of self-determination is all too often ignored , possibly for reasons of political convenience .
I am sure a large majority of the House agrees with you .
Death penalty in the United States
Things are changing in the United States .
From this point of view , I feel we can congratulate ourselves .
In this way the USA has brought itself into line with China , Congo and Iraq .
Those are particularly depressing aspects of the text now before us .
Every execution is an irreversible act and that makes it so extraordinary .
This is by no means an enviable record .
More specifically , I would ask our American friends to abolish it once and for all .
Mr President , we should be clear as to why this resolution today is so important .
There is a presidential campaign under way .
In a presidential campaign executions , regrettably , become a political football in the US .
So for the Portuguese , being opposed to the death penalty is inherent in our culture .
Mr President , my Group firmly supports this resolution .
The American election campaign could provide a unique opportunity to send a strong message about this .
Mr President , this short debate takes place against a background of increasing tension in Zimbabwe .
We must , therefore , all encourage Zimbabwe to move towards elections in May .
It is therefore worrying that constituency boundaries have yet to be set .
This could take up to three months .
This would show real transparency .
African countries must work together to consolidate their future .
The new Partnership Agreement goes further and asks for good governance .
I particularly highlight land issues .
Much of this could go to rural areas for agreed land resettlement .
The Zimbabwean people must be given a chance to choose their future .
At the moment we are receiving very alarming reports from Zimbabwe .
There are clear signs that democracy in that country could be in jeopardy .
The court rulings were ignored .
What is more serious is the fact that innocent people are being beaten for no apparent reason .
The only possible reason for this is that they oppose the government of President Mugabe .
Land reform is necessary .
There are many landless farmers and unemployed people in Zimbabwe .
It must , however , take place lawfully .
One can think of a whole range of things .
These people have , over the last few years , shown that they deserve our confidence .
These problems will not be resolved by letting the Zimbabwean army fight in the Congo .
The country cannot afford such a drain on its resources , as is evident from the economic situation .
Neither will the occupation of the land of white farmers resolve the problems .
These have been announced for June at the very latest .
In my view , Zimbabwe deserves our confidence .
The population has chosen the path of development .
I hope that nothing whatsoever is done to put an abrupt end to this .
With this in mind , we support the resolution .
I believe that we have a reasonable common position .
The elections are therefore necessary .
The rule of law is necessary .
You need to have faith in the people and in the law for the system to function properly .
Let us express our complete confidence in the Zimbabwean people and wish them successful elections for 1 June .
Mr President , it is five to midnight in Zimbabwe .
Everything points to the country sitting on a volcano that could erupt at any minute .
In the run up to the elections , Mugabe will not hesitate to use violence against his political opponents .
What is more serious is the fact that the demonstrators were arrested and the attackers left alone .
The government systematically disregards the rulings of the Supreme Court .
But it is already clear that the elections have been rigged .
A quarter of the names on the electoral lists are fictitious or duplicates .
The President is still not allowing any foreign observers in .
What else has to happen before structural aid is suspended ?
I would urge the Council and the Commission not to wait until it is five past midnight .
These are subjects which should be at the forefront of political action by the European Union .
We cannot hide the seriousness of what has been going on in Zimbabwe for many weeks now .
The fact is that Hitler is on the loose again - Hitler is out and about again there .
He is a gentleman by the name of Chenjerai ' Hitler ' Hunzvi .
This is what is happening in Zimbabwe .
That is why we have to take more vigorous action .
As regards human rights in Tibet , we also share your concern .
We will doggedly continue to raise the case of Tibet with the Chinese authorities .
Finally , Zimbabwe .
Our main concern is the organisation of free and democratic elections .
Regrettably , we interpret these disturbances as forming part of the governing party ' s election campaign .
Like the European Parliament , we utterly deplore them .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Lamy .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
World education forum
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0384 / 2000 by Mrs Lucas and others , on behalf the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance
on the World Education Forum .
There has been some progress but , unfortunately , not enough as yet .
There are 880 million illiterate adults , two-thirds of whom are girls and women .
The Community is the largest donor to many of these countries .
A prominent African leader made a very pertinent comment .
He said that education is the only existing vaccination against AIDS .
This underlines the seriousness of the problems .
Many of these children who are not in school are working .
A hundred and twenty-five million children , mainly girls , do not receive any education .
It is , of course , also a waste of human resources that this is the way things are .
At the Copenhagen Summit , the deadline was changed to 2015 .
I am pleased with this resolution .
Make resources available .
This is also our message to the Commission .
And the first form of violence is failure to provide education .
We need to invent new responses and new social attitudes .
Human beings are born in a state of dependency .
Defenceless , babies have no duties .
They cannot have any .
Duties follow awareness and awareness awakens with education .
The funds allocated to this heading represent 80 % of the total amount devoted to education .
Consequently the answer is not ' no ' , but it is not entirely ' yes ' either .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Lamy .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0347 / 2000 by Mr Collins , on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group ;
B5-0388 / 2000 by Mr Nogueira Román , on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance
on Taiwan .
Extra troops have been sent to the Chinese province of Fujian , which lies across the water from Taiwan .
China reacted furiously .
Lü had shown her true colours as an extremist and incorrigible agitator for the independence of Taiwan .
That is indeed the case .
We know Annette Lü and the new President of Taiwan Chen Shui-bian .
Their election is the crowning glory of the democratisation process in Taiwan .
Is that a threat to China ?
The Taiwanese have shown that .
For the old man in Beijing the internal developments in Taiwan must be a nightmare .
Do they really think their threats will bring results ?
As Europeans we do not need to interfere .
The idea that Beijing could represent the Taiwanese in such organisations is absolutely ridiculous .
It is extremely important for this Parliament to forge closer links with the elected representatives in Taiwan .
Democratisation in that part of the world is also important for Europe .
These results alone mark a historical turning point .
The people of Taiwan viewed any attempts by outsiders to influence them with enormous sensitivity .
Nevertheless , everyone involved was aware of the circumstances .
However , the Kuomintang still has a majority in the Taiwanese Parliament .
The region needs security and stability .
Healthy relations are also needed for economic development .
We therefore welcome the fact that both sides in this conflict are seeking a peaceful solution .
Mr President , thank you very much for letting me speak for the second time today .
The newly elected President reflects Taiwan ' s democratic maturity .
Unfortunately , democracy is not infectious !
We hope to open an office , but it is not one of our priorities at the moment .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
( The sitting was suspended at 5.25 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m. )
We shall now proceed to the vote on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
Relating to the joint resolution on Iraq
Mr President , there is a drafting error in Paragraph 2 of this resolution .
But it then continues : " forward this resolution ... and the governments of the Member States " .
This is an oral amendment .
Are there any objections ?
If there are no objections , Mr Sakellariou ' s motion will be adopted .
Mr Perry , your objection is political , not procedural .
Mr Sakellariou tabled a motion ; nobody opposed it and so the motion has been adopted .
Mr Markov , you cannot make this request on your own .
The request has to be made by 32 Members .
If this request is made by 32 Members , I can check on the quorum .
The current rule is that whoever requests the quorum has to remain in the Chamber .
Other Members could have requested the quorum and then not voted .
Consequently , all this may well be crude but it is just a touch more practical .
They work very conscientiously and we should be just as conscientious when it comes to voting !
( Loud applause )
Mr President , I think we should vote .
Mr Cox , do you really think we can make this change to the Rules of Procedure now ?
I can understand why you would have to take a head count .
I would like to know exactly how many people you counted in the chamber today ?
If you are in agreement , I would like to proceed with the vote .
Let us proceed to the vote .
Relating to the joint resolution on Chechnya
Mr President , I rise to speak about the vote on the Chechen resolution .
Everyone has agreed to this specific proposal .
( The President cut the speaker off )
At the request of Mr Sakellariou , the motion for resolution B5-0350 / 2000 has been withdrawn .
Vote ( continuation )
Perhaps you could let me know later .
Mr President , I just wanted to ask why we are not voting on Ethiopia now .
Mr Swoboda , the vote is scheduled for tomorrow morning .
It would save time if you tried that first .
Ms McKenna , this is not an issue that can be resolved right now in this Chamber .
Both your interventions - this one and the one you made earlier - have been recorded .
We will have to evaluate whether it would be appropriate to amend the Rules of Procedure .
It is not an issue that we can deal with now .
Mr President , do you feel young ?
I think you are saying that you do .
It is inexcusable that this reference to the family has been removed .
Our young people are Europe 's future .
Our society does not have enough confidence in young people .
Graça Moura report ( A5-0099 / 2000 )
Gasòliba i Böhm ( ELDR ) .
We have supported this report but there are two aspects which we are not happy with .
Mr President , I voted for the establishment of the European Year of Languages 2001 .
This statement is thoroughly valid for lesser-used languages .
All of them are already bilingual .
It is completely wrong to exclude minority languages from this initiative .
Speaking a language other than one ' s mother tongue undoubtedly broadens the mind .
This practice needs to be disseminated to the other Member States .
It is a language with European roots and easy to understand , but also rich and subtle .
I therefore regret that it is not mentioned in this proposal .
There are people who prefer Esperanto as a form of communication across national borders .
Foreign language learning is indeed the key to integration .
It is an open secret that this situation differs greatly from one Member State to another .
The Member States are therefore inherently asymmetrical in this regard .
Speaking another European language can clearly be a key to success for those young people .
Dary report ( A5-0093 / 2000 )
Maes ( Verts / ALE ) .
The problem , however , is the price .
I think our ACP partners will also be pleased with the outcome of this vote .
Lagendijk report ( A5-0069 / 2000 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
Our vote against this report expresses our opposition to the past and present policies of the European powers .
Negotiations are currently taking place with Macedonia .
Croatia , where positive political changes have recently occurred , should be involved in the near future .
These agreements are individually tailored to take account of the specific situation in each country .
García-Margallo y Marfíl report ( A5-0059 / 2000 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
We regret that our amendment was not approved .
The establishment of a pan-European equity listing would also be aberrant .
Harmonised yet competitive listings guarantee a diversity of investment products .
I have not voted for paragraph 26 which is mostly incomprehensible in French anyway .
Kuckelhorn report ( A5-0053 / 2000 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
The opposite is true of course .
Right now there is a considerable need for reform in Member States ' retirement pension systems .
Subsidiarity and free choice require this .
They must be differentiated according to whether a scheme is internal or external to the enterprise .
They must allow managers to determine the best investment strategy .
Palacio Vallelersundi report ( A5-0098 / 2000 )
In other words , even less accountable capital transactions and even fewer legislative specifications .
That concludes the explanations of vote .
COM in milk
It would be logical if this power were extended to cover milk products .
This would be the case as a result of the amendment .
This has nothing whatsoever to do with shifting the balance of interinstitutional power .
I think it is rooted in common sense , and a very far-reaching sense of consistency .
I believe the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is also unanimous on this .
This amendment to the Regulation must be made .
It will be a very good and positive move for everyone , and agricultural and dairy producers in particular .
We have a slogan in German which says ' Milk cheers up tired chaps ' .
Is this really what is intended for the entire milk sector ?
What does ' efficient ' mean in plain language ?
In this case , " efficient " quite simply means abolishing export refunds for milk products .
Do you have real calculations and reliable figures for this ? What will the situation be then ?
I am sure that you will be able to explain this in your statement in a moment .
I think I might find it rather difficult to explain to the farmers at home .
I am sure that you will be able to give us some answers in a moment .
So what is this all about ?
So we have introduced an interim stage this year .
Our WTO commitments and budgetary discipline mean that we have to adopt a selective approach .
Is that logical ?
Surely you can see that .
Why not ' weary women ' as well ?
That concludes the debate .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
COM in milk
I found that remarkable in itself .
It is remarkable how casual we in Europe sometimes are about food .
It is always there and in itself is no problem .
This has been borne out by studies .
The European Commission has also commissioned a study .
That in itself makes for a stronger case .
Anyone who thinks that the school milk regulation will rescue the dietary pattern is wrong .
You must also be realistic .
Mr President , on the basis of the information provided I shall wholeheartedly recommend this report .
I hope it will lead to a constructive position with regard to the implementation of this report .
I understand that in any case the Council of Ministers will meet next Monday .
There are two main reasons justifying this measure and why it should continue .
That is a good thing .
I myself am a great supporter of school milk .
In fact , I think that not only children but adults too should drink more milk .
Having said that , I do not support Mr Maat ' s proposals .
I have asked the Commission a number of questions in this regard .
I asked Commissioner Fischler to what extent this measure corresponded with the subsidiarity principle .
Nor is it clear to me in the school milk regulation how much will be spent on administration costs .
I am also not sure what the financial consequences will be after enlargement .
I support the Commission proposal but not the proposals of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
Until now the basis for pricing has favoured fattier products .
I ask you sincerely : is that what you want to see happening ?
The proposals before us definitely militate against that .
Can I suggest to you what might happen as a result .
There are two possibilities .
We all acknowledge the aim here .
It is to cut milk subsidies .
Let us be clear .
That is the reality of the situation .
I am not proud of that .
It is an indication of our deprived status .
This is not the European Union that I thought my nation had joined .
This is not unique to my nation .
Sadly , it affects other nations as well .
Farmers then are told to diversify , to become multifunctional .
These are the buzzwords now in the European Union .
Yet they have already diversified .
They have already become as multifunctional as humanly possible .
Cutting this subsidy would destroy an industry already on its knees .
I believe we should call a halt to this general erosion of our rural communities .
At the present moment in time , that requirement transcends the need to cut milk subsidies .
Defending communities is far , far more important .
The Agricultural Committee deserve every support in this regard .
Mr Maat has done well in a very difficult situation and I wish him every success .
Mr Maat rightly mentions the way eating patterns change with our changing lifestyle .
These children are exposed to dietary deficiencies and have difficulty concentrating at school .
Why undermine the very one which affects the health of European children ?
( The President cut the speaker off )
Milk provides a very healthy and balanced diet , something we should all support .
The European Union should take that on board .
It is good value for money .
We do not always achieve that .
We have to go back to the drawing board and ask ourselves what our priorities are .
I want to thank Mr Maat .
I think it is complete nonsense .
It is totally wrong from a nutritional point of view and it is impossible to administer .
We should instead award subsidies per pupil .
However , the school milk scheme is one of the better schemes .
It is not just beneficial to farmers .
Children do not need so much fat .
Furthermore , a scheme with subsidies per pupil would be much easier to administer .
There is an enormous amount of administration involved in the present scheme .
I have received many complaints from schools which cannot work out how to administer the scheme .
It is a real science calculating the fat percentages in milk and cheese .
The schools often end up having to pay back large sums .
The scheme which he is recommending is administratively and nutritionally the only correct one .
And thanks as ever for the usual good work of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
The school milk scheme concerns health and nutrition .
As soon as the term cofinancing is mentioned in terms of agriculture , people ' s hackles rise .
Many see cofinancing as the renationalisation of the common agricultural policy .
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is also against the Commission ' s plans .
With such a viewpoint , Parliament can make the most of it .
Are we not kidding ourselves and the sector with this attitude ?
Is massive opposition to cofinancing in the interests of the sector in the long term ?
I do not think so .
If agricultural policy is not changed we shall not be able to pay for it .
The Union should develop its policy within this context .
Is it not more sensible to seek possibilities of financing such programmes elsewhere ?
If we wish to guarantee the agricultural sector a reasonable level of support , then that is urgently required .
What do you think about a reduction on the direct income supplements ?
Those who are against cofinancing bring such painful economies a lot closer .
We do not wish to be part of that .
Thank you for your attention .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
I should now like to ask a few questions .
We can expect an evaluation to be made this year by the Commission .
I feel this is especially problematic .
You know that I do not usually speak too long .
These are Amendments Nos 2 , 3 and 4 .
There are certain cases in which this setting of the resale price can be justified .
We are talking about exclusive contracts , sections 131 et seq .
Mr President , as we are short of time I will make my statement telegram style .
First of all , many thanks to you , Mrs Thyssen , for your excellent report .
It is very likely that this will happen before the end of April .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 a.m.
( The sitting was closed at 8.20 p.m. )
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
I therefore wish I had cast my vote the other way .
I wish that to be placed on the record .
We will include this in the Minutes , Mr MacCormick .
( The Minutes were approved )
Mr President , I only wanted to report my presence for the Minutes .
We can all see , Mrs Van der Laan , that you are here .
It will be included in the Minutes .
I think that we all know the rules by now .
Mrs Buitenweg , you cannot request this on your own .
Such a request must be made by at least 32 Members .
I will check if there are sufficient Members present who wish to check the quorum .
I notice that more than 32 Members have made this request .
We will have to establish whether there is a quorum .
( The number of Members present was counted )
They also specify that the outcome of the vote shall not be made known .
It is up to the President to establish that there is no quorum .
( More than 32 Members rose in support of this request )
( The President established that there was not a quorum )
Mr President , I have been trying to catch your eye for a while now .
They have had their little pleasures , Mr President .
They were able to appear on radio and television last week .
I notice that a few other Members would like to be given the floor on this point of order .
We should , however , bring this to a close very shortly .
I am now giving the floor to Mr Schulz .
We do have individual opinions within our Group .
The delegates in the Socialist Group are not unanimous here .
I would therefore like to speak as someone who is against this process .
I do not think this is fair to these delegates !
( Applause )
We are here to work and those who are not here to work are preventing us from doing so .
Mr Schulz is right . This is completely immoral .
This is absurd , and we are making a spectacle of ourselves in front of the whole of Europe .
We cannot go on like this .
Needless to say , we will discuss this matter .
I think that goes without saying .
I still have many requests from Members to speak .
I am now giving the floor to Mr Medina Ortega .
Four MEPs have left the chamber .
The practice often consists of asking for the quorum and then leaving the chamber .
Mr Medina Ortega , we need to straighten a few things out .
We are now working within the Rules of Procedure .
The doors will remain open .
This is not the case .
Mr Posselt , there are many points of order to cover .
I am giving you the floor for the last time .
Nobody acted upon this .
Mrs Van der Laan , I understand that you would like the quorum to be checked .
According to the Rules of Procedure , a vote is to be taken on this .
We need to check whether there are 32 Members who wish to support you .
I , too , noticed Members leaving the Chamber during the count .
( Applause )
That is not a serious way of doing things .
If Parliament has to work on Friday , then people must be here .
What we are asking for is simply confirmation of whether we are observing Parliament ' s own rules .
That can hardly be called frivolous .
If the rules had been different , we would have acted differently .
Therefore , some of the 32 Members have violated the Rules of Procedure .
This is not the way things are done .
Would you like to get the quorum checked now ?
My second point is an appeal to the delegates .
I also have people behind my desk who help me in this activity .
We can monitor all corners of the Chamber .
I actually think that I have not made too bad a job of it .
We will see how the point on the agenda unfolds .
I am now giving the floor to Mrs Flesch .
Everyone is , of course , free to act as they like .
Information and communication
An information and communication strategy must , therefore , be high on our agenda .
I would much rather that the Commission ' s office in Copenhagen was a little more accessible .
I believe that you share many of my views , Mrs Reding .
It is true that there is a gulf between the citizen and Europe .
Moreover , let me tell you quite explicitly that I have taken careful note of the problems which exist .
The honourable Member also mentioned modern technology .
That must be taken into consideration .
I also think we must all clarify our respective roles .
Obviously , the Parliament ' s role is different to that of the Commission .
I am deeply convinced that Parliament ' s special role must continue .
That , Mr President , is what I wanted to say for the time being .
Mr President , I would like to thank Commissioner Reding for her response to Mr Andreasen .
We have a very committed commissioner in Commissioner Reding .
I find myself totally supportive of this motion in addressing the information deficit of the EU .
The information deficit is actually more serious than the democratic deficit that we often talk about .
In a sense , the information deficit and the democratic deficit are part of the same problem .
They have analysed the problem , suggested improvements , but sadly little has been achieved .
I wish Commissioner Reding well in getting on with this problem .
The immediate response I got this week was : " No " .
This situation is getting worse .
It is getting worse right across Europe .
We only have to look at the turn-out in the European Parliamentary elections to see that .
Why is this so ?
Why this lack of enthusiasm for the EU ?
I fear we are doing neither .
It has delivered peace and prosperity for half the continent for half the century .
Let me just suggest a few possibilities .
What happened to President Prodi 's idea of a rapid rebuttal unit ?
If it is in existence , it does not appear to be very effective .
The Commissioner said quite rightly that new technology is good .
We must make more and better use of it .
I can watch the US Senate on television gavel-to-gavel .
But not the European Parliament .
We must emphasise the good-news stories of when we help the citizen .
We have a Committee on Petitions that addresses a thousand petitions a year .
When did they past publish any of the good news that comes from that committee ?
Finally , I have to address the problem of Parliament in Strasbourg .
I am not anti-Strasbourg .
I am certainly not anti-France .
In the 21st century , I am afraid it is a symbol of waste and inefficiency .
I ask Parliament , Commission and the Council of Ministers to address that problem .
You have mentioned two aspects which I would like to stress : the regional dimension and efficiency .
The aim of the information policy is to reach the citizens .
This goes hand in hand with efficiency .
However , that it is not the way to reach the public , nor is it efficient .
Therefore , it is necessary to ensure the maximum possible degree of decentralisation .
The Commission has long had an office there .
It is rumoured that BBC Scotland is about to remove its special correspondent from Brussels .
That would be a disaster .
It is not just the Commission and Parliament which need to think about their role .
I want to draw attention , yet again , to the case of the Italian language lecturers .
That really must be taken seriously .
Mr President , a distinction must be made between information and propaganda .
Mr Prodi ' s Commission has started off badly with regard to information .
This means information and propaganda from above .
Actually , this means the spread of propaganda , not information .
Public accessibility is just as important as information .
There is a very obvious discrepancy between the official documents themselves and the conclusions being drawn .
In addition , the way Parliament disseminates information must be criticised .
It has one Internet connection .
We thank you for this .
I do not think that it was !
It is a matter of Community promotion and not self-promotion .
We cannot do both at the same time within the meaning of Maastricht and Amsterdam !
Please submit to us a specific plan of action and a schedule .
In any case , this is the impression I gained from the comments of the honourable Members .
May I first answer Mr Perry .
He said that the situation is getting worse .
That is a very negative way of seeing things .
Probably , the honourable Member is right .
I just hope the situation is not getting worse everywhere .
That would be terrible .
But if it is getting worse anywhere , we have to take that very seriously .
We cannot just say that it is getting worse and not do anything .
We have to act .
Mr Perry has addressed three specific points .
Firstly , the website address should be better known .
I know about this problem .
On 3 April we launched the new access facility - Europe direct .
We will be distributing information about this site to schools and local authorities .
However , I leave that initiative to Parliament .
I consider it very important .
There are colleagues in this Chamber who sat with me on that committee some years ago .
It is the committee most concerned with the Europe of the citizen .
In practice , the euro cannot be introduced by means of a television programme .
Of course , I cannot intervene in that respect .
It is a private decision of the media .
The information office in Edinburgh will not be closed .
So at least regional policy in this area will continue .
If we do not cooperate , we will fail miserably .
I have no intention of going into the problems of the information policy of Parliament .
The parliamentarians must do that themselves , but we should all carry out Community promotion together .
Mr Karas has quite rightly said that we need the Member States .
Without them there is no way that we can get our information across .
I know that this is easy to say and difficult to implement .
But unless we at least make a start , then nothing will happen .
( FR ) Mr President , I cannot bring about a revolution single-handed .
( Applause )
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
I share the concerns of Mr MacCormick .
That is how it was , Mr MacCormick - he is no longer here .
I would like this to be recorded .
I am taking note of this .
This will be taken care of .
I am now giving the floor to Mr Beysen on a point of order .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start the debate .
Let us not enter into discussion .
I will tell you what the Rules of Procedure are so that we all know where we stand .
I am now giving the floor to Mr Van Hulten .
Mr President , our action is not finished .
I simply want to refute that our sole aim would be to disturb proceedings .
This is what we are doing .
Mr Speroni , let us be absolutely clear about this .
Deliberation is always possible .
I would really like to know what kind of nonsense this is ?
Night flights and excessive noise
A Green Paper was presented in 1996 and nothing else has happened since .
What has been done to regulate aircraft to date ?
Standards were last established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation in 1977 .
I therefore call upon the Commission to take action in this area .
I do not wish to see Strasbourg cease working normally from Monday to Friday .
The Commission is of the opinion that decisions should continue to be taken at local level .
I would also like to touch on the subject of hushkits .
The vote will take place after the debate .
Mr President , noise pollution caused by aircraft is a very topical issue .
We talked about hushkits not so long ago .
Mr President , it is not only hushkits which are causing us considerable concern .
At night time , in particular , this level of pollution is out of all proportion .
The number of night flights should therefore be significantly reduced .
But what is meant by night ?
But , at the end of the day , it is the people living near airports who suffer .
Mr President , so what needs to happen ?
This means thorough research into low-noise engines .
This means bans and international standards .
It was our own amendment , tabled on behalf of the European People ' s Party .
The noise pollution at Zaventem has exceeded the permitted levels for a long time .
What is worse ?
All of a sudden , the trade union and employers joined forces .
It is an improvement , but not a solution .
We would like a standardised method to measure noise pollution within the Union .
In this connection , we would also like uniform standards and an effective costing rule .
This is to be welcomed , but it is not enough .
I think that , with a little good will , this should be feasible .
I am looking forward to her reply .
Mrs Van Brempt already pointed this out : we are faced with a dilemma .
Our question is , therefore : how can we marry the two together ?
It is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea .
Because one thing is clear : noise must be penalised .
We would like to have these questions answered by the Commission .
When will this happen ?
For example , at Schiphol , there is a kind of complaints desk for noise .
But this is not the case at all .
No research has been carried out into noise pollution from airports .
It is essential to transfer short-haul air freight transport to the railways .
These three matters genuinely require urgent consideration .
I imagine that other populations living near any airport in any large city will have the same problem .
Let us hope that it will improve .
Hence the opportunity for this debate , which we should thank Mr Lannoye for .
Regional planning is only a recent introduction , whereas airports have existed for a long time .
In addition , provision of information is poor .
For example , many fingers are being pointed at cargo flights .
Cargo flights generate neither more nor less noise than passenger flights .
Consequently , a thorough knowledge of the facts is necessary even for debating purposes .
Then the legislative framework is also fairly complicated .
Does night start at 10 p.m. or at midnight ?
Does it end at 5 a.m. or at 7 a.m. ?
This is something to be taken into consideration .
Another factor is the involvement of the local authorities , for every airport is different .
The noise impact differs even within the same airport according to the runway used .
In short , we are simply shifting the problem .
Technically speaking , the problem is not that enormous .
The question is whether this long wait is desirable .
I do not think so .
For the sake of fair competition , this should be done on a global scale .
I also back the other proposals to reduce noise pollution .
We have tried to restrict the noise pollution for citizens .
The airports of Liège and Maastricht are within a radius of almost 200 km .
However , you have not set any deadline for this .
In effect , this embraces the three fields of technological , economic and regulatory considerations .
However , at the same time , we have to take into account the economic aspect of the issue .
I believe that Mrs Van Brempt has outlined the dilemma very expertly .
Tens of thousands of people live and sleep a stone ' s throw away from the runway .
15 % of the population are suffering as a result of the noise pollution generated by aircraft .
Needless to say , it makes no sense to ban night flights in one Member State alone .
Businesses , such as DHL , will then simply move to airports in other Member States .
Of course , the question which arises is how to reconcile economics with preserving the standard of living .
Munich and Berlin-Tegel limit night operations to mail freight .
A general ban on night flights would therefore seriously disrupt air transport activities .
I will not bore you with the details .
You have the documents in your possession .
It has committed itself to precise deadlines .
In addition , the Commission envisages the development of a code of conduct based on current best practice .
I would also like to reply to the question on the drafting of a new noise standard .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
Mr President , in principle , we should proceed to the vote .
It appears that the joint motion for a resolution is approved by all the political Groups .
There are therefore no complications and there are no amendments .
Mr Lannoye , I understand that you are moving that the vote be adjourned .
You know very well that this motion is to be made either by 32 Members or by a group .
Are you moving this on behalf of your Group ?
Mr President , I am , of course , making this request on behalf of my Group .
In this case , Rule 146 of the Rules of Procedure applies .
This is a matter which has extremely serious political repercussions !
This was the speaker against .
Is there anyone who would like to speak in favour of the motion ?
I am giving the floor to Mr Blokland .
Mr President , I would like to back Mr Lannoye ' s motion .
We have now had a speaker in favour and a speaker against .
( The request was rejected ) We shall now proceed to the vote .
Joint motion for a resolution on night flights and noise pollution in the vicinity of airports .
Mrs Buitenweg , we are voting at the moment .
We will not enter into a debate on Friday sittings .
I would like to point out , however , that the voting will be by roll-call .
Ladies and gentlemen , we will now attempt to hold an orderly vote .
This seems to me to be in the interest of the good Rules of this House .
We are going by the Rules .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
I do not consider this acceptable .
Even then a vote is fully valid .
Mr Posselt , you are absolutely right .
It is a fact that all votes are valid , irrespective of the number of those participating .
The legality of this vote is thus beyond dispute .
I am speaking on a more general note here .
This will not help us any further this morning .
This is clear enough , I think .
Let us move on to the next item .
The forestry sector after the December 1999 storms
The issue is wider than that .
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on the forestry sector .
Did we actually intervene ?
Did we employ the means available to us ?
This time , we are not claiming appropriations for exceptional circumstances under the " natural disasters " heading .
In the space of two days , 193 million cubic metres of timber have flooded the market .
We are familiar with the regulation of the market in the context of the common agricultural policy .
The question has been put to you .
What action are you going to take ?
Secondly , what have you done and what have you achieved with the means available ?
Is the Commission prepared to take steps to do this ?
To what extent , if at all , has it approached the WTO to request it to grant derogations ?
If it has not done so , what action does it intend to take in the forthcoming weeks ?
The matter is urgent .
I will come back to this point in a moment .
The French authorities may be requested to provide further information .
However , it is first of all up to the Member States to amend their initial programmes .
The vote will take place after the debate .
You encountered a storm and weathered it without the help of the Commission .
They are also able to identify bottlenecks in the implementation of safeguard programmes .
I therefore feel that exceptional measures should also be implemented .
It would also be desirable to promote incentive measures for using the poorer quality wood for energy production .
We do not know when and in what form the next disaster will strike .
We presently have neither the money nor the infrastructure for this .
It was offered on a voluntary basis in an exemplary manner .
It is also a healthy and important expression of solidarity .
However , in itself it does not constitute a European solution .
We will expect proposals for solutions soon .
The time has come to move on .
But first we must sort out the current consequences of the Christmas storms .
This involves three things in particular .
Well , now we know that forests do not fall within the remit of the European Union .
Yet we are well aware that this will take time .
The citizens are calling for immediate action .
The resolutions deal mainly with the regulation of the timber market and export subsidies .
The forestry workers ' salary is shamefully low - a mere 6900 francs .
They are calling for a decent salary which offsets the risks involved in their job .
We support these legitimate claims .
So what has become of these famous practical proposals ?
The sustainable and efficient management of our forests requires an economically viable forest .
The Member States are , and must continue to be , the main operators in forestry policy in Europe .
This must not , however , stop Europe pursuing the coordinated management of forestry issues .
The sometimes extremely binding regulations governing the single market apply to forestry products .
In return the Community must provide support for these products , especially at times of crisis .
In Baden-Württemberg alone the accumulation of storm wood runs to about 25 million solid cubic metres .
Tidying up , storage and reforestation all involve intense physical work .
Commissioner , I know what I am talking about . I am a farmer .
You can see that .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , the natural disaster which overtook European countries was tragic .
Yet neither the Treaties nor the budgetary regulations provide for this possibility .
Moreover , the same applies within the framework of Regulation 1257 / 99 .
It is the Member State itself which has to adopt the necessary initiatives and provide for appropriate aid .
Commissioner , you have been extremely active this morning .
The debate is closed .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Declarations of vote and other declarations
This latter point is especially grave and reprehensible .
( The President cut the speaker off )
I am extremely concerned .
Once again , I apologise to the people of Ethiopia .
Mr President , I would like to support what Mr Daul has just said .
That is the real question .
I support the protest action which has been taken here today .
We shall be a laughing stock throughout Europe .
It is disgraceful .
That was the formal declaration of vote .
It is true that some have left .
There is a French saying about the arroseur arrosé - the biter being bit .
Here we have the saboteur saboté - the saboteur hoist with his own petard .
They then suggested a nominal vote so a count could be taken .
For the first time this morning I joined in the request for the quorum to be established .
I am a supporter of Strasbourg and a supporter of Fridays .
For that reason , I did not go along with it any further .
But the fact that those delegates did what they did you have to grant them .
You then have to respond accordingly .
Matters proceeded as was established .
The votes which were carried out are proper votes .
They are no less valid because only a few delegates participated .
This is a matter of genuine symbolic and political significance .
So thank you .
And , even more seriously , it appears that this incident may well be repeated every Friday .
We simply need to return to the issue of the agenda again as soon as possible .
Nevertheless , we must stop trying to hide ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
This amendment was rejected by a large majority .
Therefore , we cannot now make any changes to our practices for the year 2000 .
Parliament was prevented from voting to send aid to Ethiopia by petty political issues .
I feel truly ashamed .
Mr President , I , too , regret the actions which prevented this House from working this morning .
I feel that we must be constructive in learning from this morning ' s events .
In this regard , I would also like to thank the staff who work so exceptionally on Fridays .
That is how all this came about .
That was the consensus , and this consensus was reached here .
Perhaps it is a healthy shock and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf is perhaps right .
These resolutions are not legislative .
Thank you , Mr Posselt .
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
( The sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m. )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday , 14 April 2000 .
I will do so when you consider it to be appropriate .
Thank you , Mr Barón Crespo .
I have taken note of your proposal .
Madam President , I rise to speak on the same matter .
On 13 April , we had received a departmental note stipulating which days were holidays and which were not .
I would just like to say that I propose to raise this matter with the Bureau this evening .
Thank you , Mrs Banotti .
We will have the same situation on Whit Monday .
We will certainly have to keep a close eye on that .
The report is accessible via the Internet , as is the Spanish Government ' s response .
They were both killed by a gunshot to the head .
All seven defendants were absolved of charges of torture and belonging to an armed group .
It is important to know about this matter .
Thank you , Mr Miller .
The answer is yes : the public will be allowed to attend the meeting .
Mr Wiebenga has announced that this matter will be referred to the President and the Bureau .
My question to you is : has the Bureau looked into this matter yet ?
As you can see , we have not let the grass grow under our feet .
Thank you , Mr Barón Crespo .
We cannot continue to put up with a lame currency .
Thank you , Mr Ribeiro .
I think that this major debate will entirely meet your expectations .
Withdrawal of Mr Le Pen ' s parliamentary mandate
Mr Gollnisch , pursuant to which rule do you wish to make a point of order ?
I think that this does , nevertheless , merit one and a half minute ' s explanation .
I think that you could allow me that much time .
First of all , I would like to refer to Rule 6 .
Rule 6 incorporates the provisions covering the waiver of parliamentary immunity into our Rules of Procedure .
You will see that it is a serious matter .
This is what Rule 7 states :
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr Gollnisch , You have exceeded your allocated speaking time .
I really cannot let you speak any longer .
It is quite out of the question .
This is not the time to debate this matter , Mr Gollnisch .
I ask you to give me a few seconds in which to finish what I have to say .
( Mixed reactions )
If you have any respect for your position and for the rights of Members ...
I have the greatest respect for my position .
That time is up .
Mr Le Pen will explain the entire matter to the Committee on Legal Affairs tomorrow .
Review of the financial perspective
The next item is the statement by the Commission on the review of the financial perspective .
Mr Levi , formerly Spokesman for the Commission , has been appointed Director of the Forward Studies Unit .
The Commission thanked Mr Carlo Trojan sincerely for his activities .
That is why now is the time to safeguard this task from the financial viewpoint .
I have already had an opportunity to discuss this proposal here in Parliament .
And it certainly does not mean curtailing the direct income subsidies for farmers .
This is therefore a decision that establishes a framework for the years to come .
I think that will make the financial planning even more transparent .
Madam President , I thank the Commissioner for that report .
There were not a great many surprises in it and , to some extent , I welcome that .
A question remains , however , in relation to redeployment in Category 4 .
Can you give us some idea whether there will be any across-the-board reductions ?
Last year , the Council proposed a 10 % across-the-board cut in Category 4 .
I am still unclear as to what happens from the year 2003 .
I would regard that as the wrong approach .
So these proposals are entirely justified and no across-the-board cuts are being proposed .
Secondly , the same applies to the cuts under heading 4 .
You tell us that there is such a thing as interregional solidarity .
I think that this is a genuine problem .
I will conclude with my third question .
In its proposal the Commission has now allocated EUR 1.1 billion for the period 2000-2006 .
However , I would like to make one comment and then put a question to you .
In fact , these appropriations are urgently needed !
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , I fully and wholeheartedly support your commitment to the development of rural areas .
The second point is the use of the flexibility reserve .
This year ' s budget includes EUR 540 million for the region as a whole .
This item is closed .
As such , I would suggest voting against the amendments .
Thank you for that clarification .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Pesälä report ( A5-0081 / 2000 )
Maat report ( A5-0074 / 2000 )
A proposal such as this represented a threat to the health of our children .
This is the situation in 2000 .
For the future , the European Commission has proposed to implement a cofinancing system .
This is an unacceptable proposal !
This is the only way to ensure that this system survives .
In 1999 , however , the Commission felt that it should put a stop to this programme .
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , school milk subsidies should be reduced to zero .
We therefore view the Commission ' s proposal concerning cofinancing as a step in the right direction .
Since the 1950s , Swedish schools have provided pupils with milk and school dinners .
They have been able to do this without subsidies from the EU .
Europe is now facing a series of challenges requiring more money to be invested .
There are several arguments for doing so .
By nourishing our schoolchildren we also support our dairy farmers who need our support .
But also we are preventing surpluses like those seen in the past .
Trans-European networks ( 1998 Annual Report )
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the ELDR Group supports the Hatzidakis report .
At present , 1.2 million lorries cross the Brenner Pass every year .
The growth in the transport of goods far exceeds earlier rates of increase .
It breaks new ground and can set an example to the European Union .
I believe that can act as a further model and pave the way to an innovative approach .
He proposes increasing the budget funding .
That is why we need this redeployment .
Studies alone , however , are not enough .
That is why we must tackle the projects and why we need investment .
However , I would like to underline a few issues .
In the future , greater care should be taken in selecting such specific projects .
Good communications are a vital necessity in these areas .
But two of these aims really are vital to the European Union .
They have not done so .
Secondly , it is still a mistake to think that the trans-European networks help reduce mass unemployment .
Is there really any point in investing more money and calling for more money in this case ?
In fact , they have achieved nothing .
Perhaps the people who are protesting are actually right .
We must revise the TENs policy with a view to combining mobility with sustainability .
This is true to some extent but they also make our society more vulnerable .
They help to strengthen the cohesion between the economies of the EU Member States .
What effect does this have on the people in Europe ?
Perhaps an increase in the number of jobs in the short term .
Nothing therefore to get too excited about for the time being .
The construction of the Betuwe line through the Netherlands is becoming increasingly controversial .
Economic experts have calculated that this expensive line would never be a success .
All in all , a good enough reason to abandon the Betuwe line project .
There is still far too little broad-based , social debate on the priorities set and choices made .
Clearly , it is absolutely necessary to increase the resources available for developing these TENs .
The Commission will shortly undertake a revision of the TEN guidelines .
Like the rapporteur , I am disturbed about this .
This is an opportunity to reduce the environmental burden on the region concerned and its population .
Moreover , this project will have a positive impact on the competitiveness of the Union as a whole .
Unfortunately , however , there is still a very long way to go as regards its implementation .
The people of the region cannot understand that .
For it is they who have to live with the ever-growing avalanche of traffic .
In the end , that kind of attitude has nothing to do with solidarity .
If that was such a terrible thing , the Greens should have opposed it at the time .
They did not do so .
Let me just mention two projects that have been successful .
We want railways and we want links with remote regions .
Our committee proposes a four-sided agreement between the three states concerned and the Union .
The environmental situation in the Alps is particularly problematic .
Something therefore needs to be done in this regard .
Above all , we must persuade governments not to shift the blame onto each other .
The Italians say they will start building when the Austrians build .
The Germans say they will begin building once the Austrians are building .
The Austrians say they will start to build once the Germans and the Italians begin .
Let me make two final comments .
Madam Vice-President of the Commission . Take your time with the revision of the trans-European networks !
First , you should take another look at all the projects in the light of today ' s debate .
We should indeed accord trans-European networks the real importance which they deserve .
We should ensure that the financial resources spent on TENs are increased .
We cannot , however , accept the method that has been imposed or the solutions that have been proposed .
Are all the fourteen projects that have been accepted relevant or essential to the needs of local populations ?
The most negative aspect , however , seems to be the financing .
It is based on the principle that public funds cannot be increased , which is a moot point .
This approach to rail transport raises the issue of public service .
Alpine transit must be looked at and understood as an overall problem .
Certainly Austria , France and the neighbouring states are affected most .
Moreover , the Inntal in Austria is one of the most densely populated regions .
Alpine transit is an integral problem which needs to be addressed in integral terms .
We cannot look separately at Brenner , toll roads and Alpine transit .
What we need is cross-financing .
I think that would give us sound financing .
I call for public-private partnerships , for I think working together is the best way to succeed .
We have a massive problem with north-south transit .
That is why I have tabled a minor amendment to paragraph 7 .
I have put one of these projects before the Transport Committee .
There are few better or equally good ones .
I would be most grateful to you , Commissioner , if , today , you could allay my concerns .
However , I am a little put out that German politicians are rather less enthusiastic .
There are almost always people who automatically say ' no ' to anything new .
One should not , however , be afraid of something good .
Improved growth and employment require sums of a quite different order .
A few of these TEN projects have been carried out within a reasonable timeframe .
I am more doubtful , however , where a number of the other projects are concerned .
It is , indeed , very worrying when these ventures are not taken seriously .
Let me give an example of this .
I should therefore like , here today , to ask the Commission ' s representative a number of questions .
When does the Commission think that the Nordic triangle and the other TEN projects will be complete ?
What is the Commission actually doing to make sure that they are in fact completed ?
I believe that his work will contribute decisively to the documents which the Commission will produce .
Accordingly , I will take this opportunity to make some observations on behalf of the Commission .
You say that some projects are being delayed .
In this regard , I would like to say that the target date is 2010 .
There is therefore still time to implement them within the time limit .
Furthermore , some of the projects present great technical difficulties .
I will concentrate for a moment on one of the most talked-about projects : the Brenner base-level tunnel .
This is also true in the case of the Brenner .
I want to make this very clear .
On the contrary , there is an absolute will .
That was the percentage which you , the Parliament , considered appropriate in your most recent resolutions .
It is midway between your initial proposal and the Council ' s proposal .
That programme will cover the period 2001-2006 .
We are about to review the guidelines on the trans-European transport networks .
I will be presenting this review report and an initial proposal shortly .
Does this affect France ? Yes , of course it affects south-west France , but only to a degree .
Mr President , lastly , I would like to refer to the question of the intelligent management of traffic .
This aspect will also be included as a key element in the review of the trans-European networks .
Thank you , Commissioner de Palacio .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
European airline industry
All these aspects demonstrate that liberalisation has stirred the market .
We are faced with an overcrowded airspace , or should I say a badly managed airspace ?
We have also asked ourselves about social development and the rights of passengers .
Is that in any way related to aviation ?
These are questions which we are still left with .
Important steps still need to be taken after liberalisation .
Firstly , air traffic control should , of course , be Europeanised .
This was agreed upon in conjunction with the large political groups .
A European Aviation Safety Authority should therefore be set up as a matter of urgency .
This , of course , determines the entire structure of the aviation industry in Europe .
This is actually quite rare in the world of aviation .
No mergers have taken place .
An important question is : what do we do if we cannot pull it off with the Americans ?
What do we do then on our own ?
Secondly , intermodality is highlighted in my report too .
Trains and planes could work together very well in a number of areas .
I am well aware of this , although we are not even halfway there .
As such , we need to get a move on , otherwise we will be buried under an avalanche .
I also welcome the Commission statement that subsidies have now ceased .
This has produced the real benefits and other countries need to take a look at this .
As a result we now have substantially more competition .
I think in future we will have to deal with four important points .
Mr Sterckx has already addressed some of them , and I would like to raise them again .
Secondly , let me emphasise that we do want to see more air transport .
It enhances individual mobility .
But , on the other hand , we must not disregard environmental conditions .
My position is fairly clear on this point .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Sterckx on his report .
I would like to illustrate this with air traffic control , for example .
This is dominated by three issues : firstly safety .
Common standards and inspection agreements boost safety levels .
This should not be restricted to the EU .
Personnel too experience the adverse , social effects of cost reductions .
It is even less fun if you become the victim of overbooking .
A fat lot of good that will do them .
This is a step in the right direction .
We are always harping on about consumer interests , well , here is one .
Let us recall that the title of this communication is ' From single market to worldwide challenges ' .
Of all the many words in this communication , just one short paragraph is devoted to this issue .
Let us not underestimate either the impact of aviation on the environment .
It makes the case that the number of people flying will almost double in the next fifteen years .
I would ask therefore that we see a bit more environmental mainstreaming .
Mr Sterckx has included environment in this own report .
Meanwhile , the countries at the heart of the European Union have been faced with unexpected problems .
These airports continue to grow and they place a huge burden on their surroundings .
The air has more or less reached capacity levels in that respect .
We have reached the limits of growth .
Another issue to be resolved is the age limit .
Mr President , aviation is undergoing turbulent times .
The report drafted by Mr Sterckx elaborates on the effects of strong growth within the sector .
Competition also leads to lower costs .
The pressure on personnel in the sector is increasing both socially and financially .
It is vital to guarantee their rights .
Passengers also suffer as a result of the commercial war .
This too needs to be regulated .
The impact of all these developments on the environment is of vital importance .
And this is not likely to change in the foreseeable future
This report should also accommodate the downside of a worldwide aviation market .
In short , the aviation industry is heading for stormy weather .
In our opinion , the rapporteur is steering things in the right direction .
I shall begin with the medium term .
Eurocontrol does not work and that has been proven .
I think the European Economic Area sets a good example .
We also need private service companies to carry out the actual operations .
I admit that Mr Sterckx would like to see the term " privatisation " replaced with " liberalisation " .
I think we will be happy to endorse that .
I now turn to the short-term aspects .
The reason why I mention these points is just to lend some balance to the argument .
We accept that an increasing number of EU citizens are demanding better services .
I would finally like to mention some basic points .
And maybe it will .
On the contrary , the situation will deteriorate .
Greece is a typical example .
These are the reasons why we shall be voting against the report .
We do not think that this is a wise suggestion .
This privatisation will result in major job losses and will certainly have a damaging impact on safety .
It is estimated that air traffic will double in the next fifteen years .
We have a unified market , free movement of people and a single currency .
This is most certainly a lesson we need to learn from the vicissitudes of the hushkits affair .
In summary , and by way of conclusion , I would like to advocate a pax avianautica .
I feel that these effects of liberalisation should not be ignored .
This is extremely important .
I feel that this aspect of regional planning should be taken into account .
This gives an idea of how competition has increased over these years .
The opening up of the markets means that the sector has evolved in very diverse ways .
On the contrary , more jobs and wealth are being created .
I would like to end by referring to some of the questions that have been raised .
We will make a proposal to the effect that slot allocation should be an administrative right granted under licence .
We must therefore try to ensure that aircraft are modernised .
The question of noise is also a serious problem .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Appointment of senior Commission officials
I would remind you that the vote on this matter will take place on 17 May 2000 .
There are clear imbalances .
I am grateful to the Socialist spokesperson , who knows my wife , for agreeing with me .
It is important that we fulfil the commitment to double the number of female appointments .
We will closely monitor this appointments policy , which must be open and decisive .
At least that is what I think .
Mr President , could I begin by thanking the honourable Member for his question .
I substantially agree with the points that he very effectively made .
In fact I would only diverge on one point .
They related to three officials of German nationality , two of Italian nationality and one of Irish nationality .
In the same period 19 appointments involving promotion to grade A2 have been made .
Eleven transfers at Director level which did not involve promotion in grade have also been made .
These figures are accurate as of 27 April 2000 .
Those decisions constitute specific legal rules for the institution rather than a generalised code of conduct .
Copies of those rules have been sent to the honourable Member and they are available on the Internet .
In the case of appointments of Directors , the agreement of the relevant Director-General must also be obtained .
Mr President , I too would like to thank the Commissioner for his reply .
We have also asked to " de-flag " senior posts .
I would actually like to return to the very root cause of this discussion .
We have precise data .
The Commission has to come up with proposals on these points .
Should this be seen as an attack on the Commission ?
The rotation system is clear .
I am speaking up today as a Dutch national .
Surely this position could not be any clearer ?
What should we make of it ?
In our opinion , we really need new standards .
This is what we asked the Commission for .
The Commission was willing to produce these new standards .
What you cannot do is judge the individuals who are not yet bound by these standards .
That is a mammoth task .
In my opinion , we would then be far removed from the efficiency required by the Commission .
First and foremost , appointments must be based on the candidate ' s merits .
This is how it was described in your document and I think that this clause should be retained .
It is clear that we continue to support this .
On behalf of my Group , I would say that this question was somewhat superfluous .
This is the question we need to ask ourselves .
I feel this should be acknowledged .
We must realise this .
Vice-President Kinnock , there is a strange atmosphere in this Chamber .
I supported the submission of the question .
Let us forget the figures for a moment and focus on the functions .
This is what is to be inferred from a careful examination which is not merely concerned with numbers .
Personally , I feel very strongly that there is a need for this .
First of all , we have to say that the White Paper reforms are progressing .
They are progressing slowly but Rome was not built in a day and we must remember that .
We are all desperate to see reform but it will take time .
The new Commission has been in office for only seven months .
It was approved by the European Parliament by a huge majority .
And the PPE Group is being hijacked by that element within the group .
As the Commissioner said , you cannot take a snapshot halfway through .
We should be interested in checking systems and not checking individuals .
The role of the European Parliament is to keep the Commission on its toes .
Mrs Hautala ' s question was very well put and we also would like an answer to that .
That is a serious problem .
The fact is that Commission reform is going ahead .
Mr Prodi has made some announcements today as the head of the organisation .
That is a post that we would like to have seen advertised .
Thank you very much , Mrs Morgan .
More often than not , it turns out that there are no women at all in top posts .
Who , in the end , is to evaluate the shortlist that has been mentioned ?
More often than not , it is exclusively men who carry out the final evaluation .
I will just stipulate one or two points that are evidence of progress .
I would not claim they were perfect and this list is not exhaustive .
Secondly we are already embarked on the process of collecting mission statements from every Directorate-General .
Most have submitted theirs .
I presume that he will follow through his enquiry as to why this question was asked .
I can only say that I welcome the opportunity to provide comprehensive information .
I think that also responds to the point raised by Mrs Morgan on that subject .
The question was also raised of women ' s appointments .
That to me is modest .
Mrs Hautala and others will know of my ambitions in this respect .
I hope that is of some reassurance to Mr Dell ' Alba .
I can only ask honourable Members to wait until the physical evidence is available .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Wednesday 17 May 2000 .
Legal aspects of electronic commerce
I have to say that this attitude has also been adopted by the various political groups .
The directive is also - as I have already said - a great example of interinstitutional cooperation .
This directive is a magnificent example of teamwork by Parliament , the Commission and the Council .
We must also understand that this directive is a priority in terms of guaranteeing the development of electronic commerce .
All of these elements are Community assets as far as the competitiveness of European companies is concerned .
I still have criticisms about many of them .
Here the Commission has already given the appropriate instructions .
The Tampere Council called for reports and voted on them .
Mr President , the passage of this directive at second reading has perhaps been historic .
No amendments !
Yet it was a carefully considered decision .
Speed with certainty in this fast-moving new world is essential .
That is a good balance .
We must continually be aware that the Web is not limited to Europe .
It is , of course , global .
European business has to keep up and the key to this will be confidence .
We have to aspire to the establishment of the highest quality of e-businesses in Europe .
We should also take care to provide coherent legislation .
Confidence is essential .
There are many opportunities but what of the threats ?
One bad news story may blow confidence in e-trade for years .
E-commerce is in its early stages .
Our rapporteur has given us an extremely good basis .
The ELDR Group will stick to her original ' no-amendment ' line .
I have some sympathy with Commissioner Bolkestein here today .
Is this , we ask ourselves , the death of ideology ?
That is important and I hope that the Commission will be taking that on board .
In these circumstances we should welcome the chance to bring in an effective regulation on e-commerce .
So let us be sure that we carry the directive but do not forget the other problems .
It is an indication also of the approach this committee will take on all the subsequent legislation .
I would like to perhaps put a distinctive slant on this legislation .
All of those things were fitted into the overall framework of this directive .
So essentially this is the core principle .
That essentially is what we have here .
Clearly the Internet world is going to be highly suitable for the Commission to set that up .
We want to know where the directive is being tested in the courts .
All of those I suggest need to be covered by the feedback .
The final point I want to make is about speed .
Mrs Palacio referred in her introduction to Internet years and the speed of approach .
We were challenged by the Commission and by the Council to get this directive through as quickly as possible .
Mr President , can I too add my congratulations to the rapporteur .
It is therefore a balanced proposal .
It is now an economic and political imperative .
We do this in the full knowledge that the e-economy is evolving at a rapid pace .
We are witnessing in the 21st century the equivalent of the Industrial Revolution .
That means , as policymakers and institutions , we are still navigating our way through uncharted terrain .
In particular , this is the case given the global nature of e-commerce .
We have in this directive an article which allows us to do that .
I would warn against complacency .
The legal framework of the internal market plays a crucial role in this .
Parliament works significantly faster .
The country of origin principle is one of the internal market ' s cornerstones .
It is therefore obvious that this should be extended to cross-border e-commerce .
I would therefore call on the Commission to support initiatives to this effect .
I would like a reply to this question .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work .
Without consumer confidence , e-commerce is going nowhere .
There has already been reference here tonight to the need for revision .
Even before we adopt the directive we are talking about revision and I think that is very wise .
The absence of legal infrastructures is holding back development .
All these areas will have to evolve , and , in many cases , change completely .
This potential for growth is our challenge for the future !
Communication using computers should be viewed in the same way as any medium of communication .
Is there anyone who wants to see a utilitarian nanny State ?
I do not think so .
I welcome her recommendation that we should not suggest any amendments to the common position .
All current surveys show the great economic potential of electronic business .
Europe continues to trail behind the USA in e-business .
Yet we have a real chance to catch up .
Europe is presently seeing a wave of Internet companies being set up .
We must give political support to this trend .
Many thanks !
I think that means we have a very good policy in that area as well .
That will send out a clear signal .
I believe it is also a good signal in terms of attracting foreign investment .
Here the regulation provides that what is known as the principle of the country of origin should apply .
That saves him a considerable financial outlay in these transactions .
That is why we need changes to the law and more far-reaching harmonisation in some respects .
I am glad the directive also contains a review clause .
I would ask the Commission to take that very seriously .
This can be done quickly if necessary , as Mr Lehne pointed out .
So there is no reason to delay .
Speed on this occasion is of the essence .
Of course , it is essential that we have a legal framework in place as soon as possible .
We should not forget that the Internet is international .
The rapporteur analyses the common position in the spirit of constructive criticism .
My second point concerns cultural assets .
I think that is not good enough .
I ask the Commission to devote special attention to these two points .
I am a little out of breath .
Hopefully , however , it will not have an effect on the matter in hand .
As so many have already said , the matter is urgent , and I agree .
There is competition with regard to speed and innovation .
New jobs will be created where the new technology is first introduced .
That is why I support the previous speakers regarding the adoption of the common position with no amendments .
Mrs Palacio has spoken about a milestone in the development of the European Union .
This is legislation which will offer legal certainty to industry and the consumer .
Furthermore , the directive strikes a very precise balance between all private and public interests involved .
This has also been acknowledged by various MEPs .
Some Members are left feeling not completely satisfied .
This is understandable .
This is , of course , true .
As I said , I understand that not everybody can be happy when the right balance is struck .
Parliament has not tabled any amendments and has thus paved the way for a swift approval .
I too would like to express my appreciation for this .
Parliament has been extremely sensible , if I may say so .
Those amendments have been incorporated in the Commission ' s amended proposal and subsequently in the common position .
This has also been highlighted by the rapporteur and the Commission is grateful for this .
First of all , I would like to address a comment made by Mr Harbour regarding feedback .
Those restrictions also apply to selling via the Internet .
The risk is there .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Food Aid 1999
But let me add a few general comments .
Instead , we should increase still further the share of food aid in the form of grants .
To finish , a word about the forthcoming WTO talks .
As such , we can hardly deny this Food Aid Convention review our approval .
In this way , local food production is often thrown off balance and deeply discouraged .
The Convention is used as a lubricant for commercial transactions and often clashes with social and cultural traditions .
These rules are now also incorporated in this international food aid agreement .
In my view , the intention to promote local agricultural development is vital .
Despite this , there is still a blemish on the new Convention .
The European negotiators have succeeded in cutting mixed aid in the form of loans down to 20 % .
But what is 30 years in the life of a nation ?
I am thinking particularly of areas where the desert is literally burying the productive land .
This is an issue that will have to be addressed in the future .
Water will become more valuable than oil in future in developing countries .
It is also good news that the new Convention covers transport costs and associated operational costs .
Mr President , I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur .
There is still an institutional resistance to radical reform of food aid policies .
This is summed up by the kind of tinkering on the edges which characterises the re-negotiated Convention .
That is very important indeed .
Clearly the challenge is to meet the needs of the hungry in the most locally sensitive way .
We need to see foodstock plans based on knowledge and transparency .
This would represent very real progress in the attempts that we make to tackle food security .
Mr President , this Convention will only be successful if , in time , it becomes redundant .
The Fiori amendment is preoccupied with Europe ' s own interests and is therefore wide of the mark .
As such , vitamin tablets from Canada do not form part of this .
Only when we manage to achieve this will aid no longer be necessary .
Mr President , I strongly support Mrs Schierhuber ' s report on food aid .
One euro a day is enough for survival and offers a chance for the future .
That is feasible , in any case .
How will future generations judge us , I ask myself ?
The report rightly refers to a whole range of guidelines on fighting poverty .
For reasons of time I cannot go into them in detail .
But the careful observer will notice that there are different weightings at work here .
We hold the goods of this earth on trust for our descendants .
If we take that approach , then I am convinced we really can combat poverty .
It is not charity , then , that Africa needs .
In my opinion , the correct weighting should be given to European production .
And that is why the Commission requested extending the period of validity of that convention until 30 June 2001 .
The new convention attaches special importance to the following points .
Firstly , more consideration is to be given to local nutritional customs .
Our position is as follows : food aid must be clearly separated from commercial transactions .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Fischler .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Aid to uprooted people in Asia and Latin America
Mr President , I am indeed privileged today to present this report to Parliament .
All are waiting with bated breadth to hear my speech .
This is a very urgent matter .
The extension we propose is for one year until 31 December 2000 .
Between 1997 and 1999 , Parliament sanctioned EUR 240 million .
This regulation came to an end on 31 December 1999 .
In addition , and more importantly , more than fifty NGOs were consulted .
Therefore the Parliament played a major role in producing this regulation with its report .
This is also a very timely report in the context of asylum-seekers .
The need for this work remains as strong as it did four years ago .
Or like the protection of the terrorised indigenous peoples fleeing from Burma .
On this regulation , we know that the Council has some divided thinking .
I have to say , Mr Patten , I regret that the Commission does too .
It is the usual way things are debated in parliaments .
A report is submitted which says that we must now extend the regulation .
It is four months since it expired .
But how can we do this without the necessary reports at our disposal ?
We hope that the report and in-depth evaluation will as yet be forthcoming .
Little consideration has so far been given to the operation of this programme .
Sound annual evaluation reports are lacking .
Moreover , we are still waiting for a long-term vision for this programme .
None of this detracts from the fact that the recipient countries sometimes have dire situations to contend with .
The European Union must help where it can .
The role of the national Member States , however , is at least as important .
Nothing more , nothing less .
The Bible as always is right when it states that there is a giving which does not impoverish .
The other side of the coin is also true .
Hoarding does impoverish .
The fact of the matter is that those displaced are mostly women and children .
This makes it even more imperative that action should be taken .
I welcome the recognition of this .
If such reports are not forthcoming then I could not find my vote to go with this renewal .
I believe that the Commission must answer to this and tell us what they are going to do .
The financial framework needs to be introduced in keeping with provisions already agreed to .
These provisions must be strictly adhered to and this change is absolutely necessary .
Mr President , the Commission proposes that the existing regulation be extended .
It is important that the programme should be extended , but not before we have seen the evaluations .
The purpose of the evaluation is , of course , to improve the future programmes .
It is this Directorate-General which has the expertise and it should therefore also have the responsibility .
It is indefensible and damaging to the programme that no effort is being made to introduce coherence .
However , he is only speaking for himself .
The Commission started preparations for the renewal of this regulation in Spring 1999 .
However , these discussions were delayed by the former Commission ' s resignation last year .
The final evaluation report will be submitted to the Parliament by September of this year .
Now let me come to the fourth amendment .
I recognise that the Parliament would like to see the independent evaluation report extremely soon .
A number of honourable Members have argued that you should see that by July .
That will give us a reasonable period to evaluate 1999 ' s activities .
I want to make that commitment unequivocally .
I hope that Parliament would be willing to agree this approach .
There have been references to the new regulation .
I can confirm that the new regulation is under preparation .
So I hope that we can do better by the time we next discuss this important subject .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11a.m.
I also want to thank the Commission for its good work in connection with the negotiations .
I also want to emphasise that it is important to view the agreement in its entirety .
Mr President , I too want to thank the rapporteur for his report and congratulate him .
Its adoption of the regulation on the liberalisation packages is the most practically significant measure .
On the one hand , Switzerland will gradually forego reducing the number of heavy goods vehicles .
So you can understand why the transport operators are rather critical of that .
It is a step in the right direction .
But there are a few aspects that still need clarification .
These cross-border workers are very seriously affected by the most recent deteriorations in Swiss pension schemes .
Under the tenth review , which recently came into force , this rule was removed .
It was replaced by educational credits , which were , however , tied to residence in Switzerland .
I hope all this will change in the near future .
Cross-border workers pay in just as much pension insurance as their Swiss counterparts but receive considerably lower pensions .
Since these instances of enlargement , a debate has begun on differentiated integration .
The first Agreement on the European Economic Area was offered to the EFTA countries .
It was then that concentric circles were being spoken of for the first time .
EEA membership was rejected in a Swiss referendum .
So the only countries remaining in the EEA were Iceland , Norway and Liechtenstein .
Bilateral agreements began to be drawn up for Switzerland .
Negotiations are now under way regarding the future accession of twelve countries to the European Union .
I very much hope we will make progress in this regard over the next few years .
That is a major advantage for both sides .
They have no say as regards its content .
That is something the European Parliament could organise .
In fact , this would also be a step towards bringing Switzerland and the European Union closer together .
I would very much hope we could do that .
Aside from that , let me thank Mr Carraro again for this excellent report .
Anyone who wants to learn will find a great deal of information in his report .
Once again , many thanks and I hope we will adopt it by a large majority tomorrow .
We want closer cooperation in Europe .
We want more dialogue .
The peaceful settlement of conflict - i.e. democracy - versus the declaration of war .
In fact , war never has been a solution for the people of Europe .
We need ground rules for democracy , and in the end we must also abide by them .
That should set us thinking .
I believe it is important that we use democratic methods to safeguard peace .
In Austria , Mr Haider resigned on 1 May .
He no longer plays an active role in Austrian politics .
We very much welcome the report by Mr Carraro and his colleagues .
But it has been a useful debate which has reflected the importance of the subject .
We are extremely satisfied that Parliament has given this verbal approval to the seven agreements with Switzerland .
They are the result of four years of extremely difficult and tough negotiations .
The agreements are very important .
They are very important politically and they are very important from a technical point of view as well .
They unblock the stalemate in the relations with one of our closest neighbours and our second biggest trading partner .
Equally important , a viable solution has now been found for alpine transit .
The European standard of free movement of persons will also be introduced in relations with Switzerland .
I want to make it absolutely plain that the Commission shares these concerns .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11a.m.
Financial assistance to Moldova
Examined in human and economic terms , Moldova is faring very badly .
The social situation is chaotic and democratic progress painfully slow .
Industry is still underdeveloped and unevenly distributed regionally .
A modest export trade is based on the sale of agricultural produce to neighbouring regions .
A look at the figures will show the level of desperation that exists .
Bilateral financial aid via the TACIS programme has been reasonably successful .
This , however , is not enough .
The other problem with regard to Russia is connected with the withdrawal of troops from Moldovan territory .
Furthermore , talks on dismantling Russian missiles stockpiled in Moldova must be pushed through immediately .
My report was unanimously adopted in committee .
There were good and sensible additions made to it by the Committee on Budgets .
I hope that this spirit of consensus will be present too in tomorrow ' s sitting .
The European Union is granting different forms of economic aid to different countries .
That is a maximum annual figure of EUR 200 million from the Guarantee Fund .
The people once again find themselves living in poverty .
The average monthly per capita income in Moldova is only approximately EUR 30 .
For days now , there has been a very real risk of all the lights going out in Moldova .
Many young Moldovans are looking towards the European Union .
At home , most of them want Moldova to become more open to the European Union .
How can we , the European Parliament , make it easier for Moldova to become more open ?
But Moldova must also know where it wants to go .
In that case , it also deserves stronger support on our part .
That support must be conditional on a radical modernisation of its economy and administration .
We hope Moldova will opt for renewal and for Europe .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs Matikainen-Kallström ' s report deserves our full support .
She has guided this ' child ' in difficult circumstances , for which I thank her .
It seems that the direction is not always clear .
Moldova ' s need for finance will be huge in the years to come .
The Russian crisis on 17 August 1998 had an enormous effect on Moldova .
It has become a ragamuffin state .
The basic pension is just one fifth of the heating costs of one small flat .
No nation can live and function like that .
The balance of trade surplus is a massive 23 - 25 % .
Our Group supports the rapporteur ' s views .
The country ' s economy has shrunk by around two thirds in the last ten years alone .
It will be extremely hard for Moldova to overcome its huge problems without foreign assistance .
The Union ' s support for Moldova is thus in place .
Moldova is still living proof of this .
Hence the present , third request for macro-financial support from the European Union .
However , I have two questions .
What has been the effect of the European Union ' s two previous capital injections into that country ?
Could the Commission be specific about this ?
Moldova is a country where the community , or society , has abdicated responsibility in a number of areas .
Many have to wait for over a year for their money , and sometimes even longer .
Moldova is today experiencing general migration .
We can do nothing other than support this country , Europe ' s very poorest .
Therefore , the Commission will support these amendments in the Council and I hope they can be taken forward .
Nevertheless , I would suggest to the rapporteur and honourable Members that they reflect further on the remaining amendments .
In our opinion this initiative would be excessively bureaucratic and would not make sense .
I would remind you that the Economic and Financial Committee is not a normal committee .
In our view these are the people who really have the ability to carry out this management .
In some cases they will be available to us , in other cases they will not .
By means of both reports , the Commission will have access to all the necessary budgetary information .
Nevertheless , in order to assess the aid we should be allowed more time .
In our view , there is no difficulty .
We believe that this type of aid can be dealt with by means of the current budgetary resources .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11 a.m.
( The sitting was closed at 10.55 p.m. )
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
It says 65 % in the German version of the Minutes .
( The Minutes were approved )
Combating counterfeiting and piracy
Piracy and counterfeiting constitute a risk to consumer health and safety .
This also undermines the fiscal resources of the state authorities .
Finally , it has been established that this phenomenon is often closely linked to organised crime .
If we are to prevent this scourge , we must first familiarise ourselves with it .
Of course , each Member State has its own internal regulations for law enforcement .
Obviously , penal sanctions must be made more stringent and civil measures and procedures must be simplified .
The approximation of the penal sanctions applied by different nations in the case of customs offences is certainly desirable .
It will also be appropriate to pay particular attention to matters of international judicial cooperation .
Mr President , I want to congratulate Mrs Fourtou on this important report .
It can be dangerous to health .
It can certainly be dangerous to innovation .
It can be dangerous for the future of research .
This is not a victimless crime .
We are talking about things that seriously damage the marketplace .
My second point has been touched upon by the previous speaker .
These must be kept separate .
A number of amendments from the political groups and the committees have tried to make this clear .
We do not want to see these two debates confused .
The Green Paper is , of course , a good one .
The Legal Affairs Committee has incorporated most of the proposals made by the various committees asked for an opinion .
Mr President , this is a useful draft legislative provision .
We must consider the implications of these inferior quality products for consumers .
We must find the means to curb the globalisation of counterfeiting and piracy .
Should the aforesaid undertaking not be a condition sine qua non ?
I foresee the risks of allowing harmonisation to become an end in itself .
Given the real risk of losing focus , I should like to issue a warning to the Commission .
But , of course , there is no fundamental difference between the two .
If that happens , we allow it to happen at our peril .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Transitional civil administration / peace accords
In this regard , I nonetheless feel a certain unease .
More information is required in this area .
There appear to be a number of gaps in this area .
There must be a great readiness to engage in continued operations of this kind .
There are positive features to be mentioned .
The Committee on Budgets has a large number of questions regarding these figures .
These considerations must not lead to the aid programme becoming bogged down in vague decision-making processes .
Against this background , we support the Laschet report .
For this reason , I would like to congratulate him on his splendid work .
The first concerns Category 4 .
Category 4 is already overloaded .
This transfer will bring with it a considerable need for additional financing in Category 4 .
Another problem concerns competence .
This is what is really at issue in Bosnia or in Kosovo .
What is the state of affairs , five years on , in Bosnia-Herzegovina ?
How is the outcome of the war in Kosovo to be appraised ?
How much did the military intervention cost ?
How much did the destruction cost ?
What is more , the planned solutions to assist these protectorates are problematic and harmful .
The deutschmark is foisted on Kosovo , and the law of the market prevails .
As far as we are concerned , the outcome of the military intervention speaks for itself .
Milosevic is still in power .
Kosovo is a ravaged country .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
I shall not dwell on aspects which have already been extensively discussed .
I should like at this point to return to one aspect I consider more fundamental .
The European Union is no exception .
Carraro recommendation ( A5-0118 / 2000 )
So pensioners are responsible for everything that goes wrong !
Therefore , the Pensioners ' Party has a liking for Switzerland .
It was therefore necessary to find some means of maintaining links between Switzerland and the EU .
This led to the signing of bilateral agreements .
This represented a minimum guarantee of coherence .
Shortly thereafter , the Council referred the matter to the European Parliament .
As it happens , our rapporteur is urging us to do so , and I shall follow his lead .
We must send out a positive political message by giving our assent .
I should , however , like to add a few minor points .
Switzerland must indeed clarify its position in relation to the European Union .
It must not be allowed to carry on picking and choosing the European policies it wishes to implement .
Laschet report ( A5-0111 / 2000 )
Let us make no mistake !
Hatzidakis report ( A5-0076 / 2000 )
Sterckx report ( A5-0075 / 2000 )
There is no mention of its huge impact on the environment .
These are the negative results of liberalisation .
Even the United States of America has not privatised its air traffic control agency .
It remains subject to the federal authority of the Federal Republic of the United States of America .
Even the home of liberalism did not go for this option .
They make this quite clear on a regular basis .
A subsequent return of liberalism will come as no surprise .
These are some of the reasons why we cannot vote in favour of this report .
Fourtou report ( A5-0096 / 2000 )
We must face facts . We already have tried and tested practices at national level .
Damage to the economy is much more significant .
These figures are probably still greatly underestimated , and Internet imperialism will make them higher still .
This gives us an indication of the major stakes involved for the internal security of our Member States .
I am thinking , for example , of pharmaceutical products and spare parts for cars .
Increasing penalties might also have a deterrent effect .
Counterfeiting and piracy constitute a threat to the proper operation of the internal market .
They introduce distortions of competition .
They undermine the foundations of a sound economy .
This consumer must be protected , so much is clear .
It is in this spirit that I support Mrs Fourtou ' s report .
That concludes the voting .
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 a.m. )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday , 4 May 2000 .
Around four hundred homes have been destroyed by the explosion , and more than a thousand have suffered damage .
Ladies and gentlemen , I invite you to observe a minute ' s silence .
( The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence )
- Thank you , Mr Oostlander .
This forum means to affirm that intimidation and blackmail are not enough to silence consciences .
Relating to Thursday :
We can have five items in the Human Rights section .
At the moment , we only have four .
We therefore have the opportunity to add a further item , and I have received three requests .
There are no substantial differences between us .
Thank you , Mr Barón Crespo .
I think the House is now sufficiently well informed to proceed to the vote .
( Parliament rejected the proposal )
And now to the proposal from the Group of the European People ' s Party on hooliganism .
It is not often that we discuss urgencies that might be able to change something for the better .
We are always very reactionary and talk about things that we really cannot affect .
However , next month , before we sit again in Strasbourg , the European football championship starts .
This is what this motion is about and I very much hope Members will support it .
( Parliament approved the proposal )
Now , I do not think that this is the appropriate place to debate this .
We can then decide next month what we want to do in the long term .
Thank you , Mrs van der Laan .
But we cannot keep in touch with what is happening .
What are you going to do about it , Mary ?
Thank you , Mr Blak .
Mrs Banotti will reply immediately .
Madam President , this is becoming a regular item .
We were not getting interpretation throughout .
Mr Blak will explain it to you .
But let those who want to work here on a Friday do so in peace and quiet .
I will allow two more speakers and then we shall move on to the order of business .
Madam President , I think there is a misunderstanding here .
Mrs Van der Laan spoke about the proposal made by the Bureau to the Conference of Presidents .
Surely a proposal from the Bureau cannot simply be sidelined .
All we want is that it should also be discussed and that a vote should be taken on it .
The first possibility is to scrap Friday sittings altogether .
We shall hear your comments , presented as procedural motions .
Madam President , on a point of order .
I was simply making a protest about the electronics here .
I just wanted to point that out .
Thank you , Mrs Ahern , we shall take steps to ensure that this does not happen again .
Madam President , on a point of order .
It is the same point , and for once I agree with Mrs Ahern .
This must be a first !
Madam President , I should like to start where Mrs van der Laan left off .
We really cannot tolerate behaviour of this kind !
Madam President , I should like to respond to what my fellow Member has just said .
It is inaccurate , therefore , to accuse Members of sabotage .
Madam President , I could not agree more with the observations made by Mr Wiebenga .
I wanted to highlight these two aspects .
Reference can be made to the last roll-call vote for this .
Madam President , I have little to add after Mrs Oomen ' s intervention .
I only hope that you will understand this .
I support the action in this sense .
It is easy to check up on , because electronic voting took place that day .
This has also given rise to quite a major debate in my own country , Sweden .
We must get a serious discussion under way about these matters .
Either we make Friday a proper working day or we do away with it .
I will be very brief , Madam President .
I cannot therefore put this request to the vote .
I am counting on you all , if only for the benefit of the public that attends our debates .
In my report I make my opposition to this absolutely clear .
The agriculture budget is neither a self-service shop nor a high-yielding dairy cow .
Our farmers are already experiencing uncertainty of a kind which ought to make us stop and think .
After all , we have already tightened the large ones as far as they will go .
We need to change fundamental aspects of our agriculture policy for the long term !
I refer in particular to the moisture content of cereals and the monthly increments .
That is what I want to prevent at all costs .
I started the report by reminding you of the beauty of the European agricultural landscape .
I should like to finish with the sentence : ' Food and drink hold body and soul together ' .
Let us not forget this , even in our political considerations and decisions !
Nothing more , nothing less .
This is an achievement in itself in certain sectors of agriculture .
In various European countries , large groups of farmers are in dire straits .
At present , there is a great deal of suffering in silence .
So far , it would seem that the agricultural budget was born under a lucky star .
The euro-dollar rate impacts favourably on the budget , although certain figures are a cause of concern .
There is nothing to say , however , that things will remain the same forever .
Despite this , the Commission has made various proposals to benefit from the agricultural budget , if possible .
The budget will stick to this principle .
Am I not right in thinking that sugar fell outside the scope of the Berlin agreements ?
But that is not the case !
The proposals on setting institutional prices and monthly increments cover the products already mentioned .
I should like to fully support the rapporteur ' s stance in this regard .
We should not continue to exert pointless pressure on farmers ' incomes .
I am familiar with the argument that we would save this amount because of the exchange rate mechanism .
This was also reiterated when we were discussing the organisation of the market in sugar .
Personally , I was extremely pleased at least by this admission from the Council at this stage .
The same applies to moisture content in cereals .
The Berlin agreement must continue to be our benchmark .
This is purely accidental .
All these points which I mentioned are also backed by the Liberal Group .
I would like to add a few more points , however .
We are living in an era in which the agricultural budget is extremely tight .
Potentially , however , there is another very large gap .
It was agreed in Berlin that this can no longer be the case .
Without a doubt , the issue of funding the whole reform package plays a decisive role .
This meant that the agriculture budget was fixed at EUR 50.5 billion and it should stay as such .
Agricultural prices change particularly quickly .
As a result of excessive over-production , pig prices fell by 9 % .
In the saturated marketplace , only products produced economically can be sold .
The price reductions will destroy farmers ' livelihoods in Europe and thus temporarily ease the pressure on the market .
Another price war will lead to a new round of market redistribution .
I am very pleased to see Commissioner Fischler here to listen to this debate .
This happens in many instances .
I would also like to congratulate the Commission on having included a multiannual element in the proposals .
Article 10 ( 3 ) of the Regulation on processed fruits and vegetables provides for lump sum aid .
This aid is going to stop very soon ; it comes to an end during this season .
In my opinion , it should be included in the next amendment of the COM in fruits .
Will it be extended ?
What is the intention here ?
Does this fit in with the Commission ' s plans ?
They are important sectors because they affect very specific areas .
It is necessary for this Parliament to make decisions on a new and ongoing agricultural policy after 2006 .
It is the farmers themselves who will ultimately have to pay these costs .
The farmers for their part have carried out all their duties and obligations .
The question therefore is : what are the farmers doing about this ?
The question is what will farmers and consumers do about this ?
Will they step up their fight ?
Thus the subsidies end up becoming a white elephant .
( The President cut the speaker off )
And how are these millions going to be used ?
I therefore think that this policy calls for caution , Commissioner .
And you have our support .
Commissioner , we are counting on you a great deal .
After all , it is the first which you have tabled in the House .
I shall now turn to the individual amendments put forward .
Amendment No 4 seeks to leave the monthly increments unchanged .
On the contrary , this is the logical consequence of the decisions made in Berlin !
You see , in Berlin it was decided to maintain the system of monthly increments .
But that has nothing to do with adjustments to the amounts .
In the past , too , we made adjustments- more or less - every year .
That is why I cannot accept this proposal .
I do not think that we should reopen this debate now .
That is why I cannot agree to Amendments Nos 2 or 5 .
It does not present a particular problem to farmers .
I now come to Amendments Nos 6 and 7 .
Some clarification is probably called for here .
At this stage , the Commission has specifically decided not to prejudice anything here either .
However , this was rejected by Parliament .
We will commission a study of this kind .
We will not obtain the results from those carrying out the study any earlier than that .
However , in principle , it is the Member States who are responsible for this issue .
We expect this report to be ready at the beginning of the second half of this year .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Flax and hemp for fibre
All the same , in my opinion , the Commission proposals overshoot the mark a little .
Allow me briefly to outline the basic considerations underlying my report .
Allow me to make one further comment on hemp because there is still some misunderstanding here .
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted this report by a large majority .
Flax , like hemp , is a special product , with a long European tradition .
We all know what happened to short flax .
People have overstepped the mark .
At the same time , they form a true complement to agricultural policy .
This is why I give my full backing to Mrs Schierhuber ' s report .
I would like to end on a historical note .
We therefore also ask you to consider the proposal presented by the Committee on Agriculture .
We are therefore voting against the report with regard to the disappearance of these contracts .
The existence of a contract is the best way of proving that the crop has been sold and processed .
There are no great differences between them .
As far as cereals are concerned , however , the differences are considerable .
Excellent schemes are already being developed and should be supported .
For example , 80 % of the land mass of my nation , Wales , is non-arable .
I would like to thank the rapporteur for accepting our amendments in this regard .
We also believe there should be a balance of support between farmers and processors .
Mrs Rodríguez Ramos ' amendments therefore seem to me to be a good solution to the problem .
It is vital not to lose sight of this objective .
It is precisely with the short-fibre variant that farmers fiddled the system .
An increase in support should , however , be accompanied by the following three control measures .
Thirdly , the use of certified seed .
Firstly , the Commission is explaining the need for the reform in terms of an increase in budgetary cost .
However , the thing that seems least appropriate to me is the proposal on processing aid .
These were the words of the local Minister for Agriculture for that region .
This type of situation will become inevitable if this amendment is put into practice .
However , I shall not repeat the many reservations about the proposals that colleagues have already mentioned .
We should note that flax and hemp are environmentally-friendly crops .
We should welcome , therefore , the expansion of industrial crop activity and the opportunities provided for diversification .
It would be helpful if the Commissioner could comment on this matter when he responds to the debate .
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Schierhuber .
I have a feeling that this type of subject matter is right up her street .
That is why the Commission was right to intervene .
Instead , they should be tied to certain user capacities .
Perhaps this initiative could help us to turn the corner .
You know what procedure this is .
Per-hectare aid for hemp is more than twice as high as that for cereals .
It gives farmers time to adapt .
I cannot , however , live with the recommendation from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
I take the opposite view , namely that the aid should be limited .
The proposal before you today has three main objectives .
It is intended to put a stop to subsidy-hunting once and for all .
You see we are not under any illusions !
The Commission has carefully examined Parliament ' s amendments .
Then there are others which , I am afraid , we cannot accept .
However , in my opinion , it is doomed to failure .
The same goes for Amendment No 37 which is along the same lines .
Nevertheless , problems could arise in some areas .
We will try to find a solution here , so as to reduce the possible constraints which might arise .
I can accept Amendment No 6 on hemp .
This is a highly political issue which we can certainly discuss further .
But the actual objective is clear .
It is a fact that processing long-flax fibres entails higher costs .
Our policy for the sector has to be unambiguous .
We can only accept investment in products which are profitable under market conditions .
This principle also applies here .
Nevertheless , the limits given in the budget cannot be exceeded .
The second important subject is the national guaranteed quantities .
In view of the well-known difficulties with checking harvest results , these are absolutely indispensable .
A maximum guaranteed quantity for the whole Community would not be a solution .
That is why I cannot accept Amendments Nos 20 , 21 , 27 to 30 and 35 .
In this case , I would be bound by the figures in the 2001 budget .
A reform of this sector is absolutely essential !
I think that you agree with me on this .
We really should not allow this kind of situation to develop .
Mr President , allow me to ask the Commissioner one more question .
Mr President , with your permission I should like to ask the Commissioner a supplementary question .
Perhaps I will begin with the second question , which was asked by the rapporteur .
In this regard , I have said that we are prepared to accept a quota of this kind .
I now turn to the first question , which was asked by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf .
And so I do not want us to turn the system completely on its head .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Fischler .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon .
Civil liability and motor vehicles
Mr President , I must , and can , be brief .
It is about improved protection for accident victims in the European Union .
Commissioner Bolkestein , a draft fifth directive already exists .
I have drawn it up and it will soon be put before Parliament .
I very much hope that we will also be able to cooperate closely on this issue .
The fifth directive is therefore already in the pipeline .
I would be very grateful to you in particular , Commissioner , if we could achieve this together .
That is a very big step forward .
When we debated this , some questions were still open .
You overcame resistance from within your own Commission .
This was a great achievement and we thank you very much for it .
Mr Rothley was extremely kind in thanking the Commission for what it has done .
The Commission is duly thankful to him for that initiative .
I wish to say that the Commission welcomes the adoption of this fourth motor insurance directive by Parliament .
This is also a measure which will bring the European Union closer to the citizens of the Union .
Mr Rothley has announced a fifth directive .
I have to tell Mr Bigliardo that this is a matter which does not concern this directive .
Strictly speaking , I could end my response there but his comments deserve a fuller answer .
That is a clear case of discrimination .
But that is not the case .
They relate to the different areas of Italy .
I do not think that the Commission can intervene on that point .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Bolkestein .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon .
Development cooperation with South Africa
It is very worrying that we should find ourselves in such a situation .
This took us past the expiry date and led us to the legal vacuum which I just mentioned .
The Council finally presented its proposal .
The first question refers to commitology .
During the previous five years the budgetary framework had been EUR 125 million per year .
Both amendments seem well-considered .
This is actually an unproblematic regulation and also , in fact , an unproblematic report .
The Council accepted nearly all of the amendments .
Of course , the rapporteur also referred to this .
The limit of EUR 5 million gives sufficient room for manoeuvre .
For the time being I offer you my warmest congratulations on this .
Today it is a question of anchoring the rule of law more firmly in the State .
I read with concern reports about the misuse of tax revenue at provincial level .
The situation is similar in large areas of South Africa .
I hope that this expectation too will be taken seriously in Pretoria .
The PPE-DE Group will be voting in favour of the report .
We thank you very much for it .
We are clearly in a very serious situation .
The regulation for South Africa expired on 31 December 1999 .
This budget line is the work of the European Parliament .
I was the budget rapporteur in 1994 when the Development Committee established the line .
Surely that has been one of the most encouraging events in recent history .
Decisions need to be made .
We cannot risk delay .
Even the 2000 budget of EUR 1.54 million would not be committed .
Let us be clear what we are talking about .
We risk jeopardising support for social housing programmes in South Africa .
The European Parliament position is , and always has been , realistic and morally right .
However I must express my grave concern about the possible misery which would be caused were we to delay .
It is the first year of the South Africa Trade Agreement .
To do that we have to have a regulation sooner rather than later .
They may want to escape their past , but they are compromising their own future in the process .
The Council has sat on the regulation for far too long .
A maximum of 5 million seems very reasonable to me .
Mr President , South Africa has enormous potential .
There is so much there which so few have enjoyed .
Economic growth is a necessary but not an adequate condition for development .
Mr President , I would like to start by adding my thanks and congratulations to the rapporteur .
Half of South African households are classed as poor .
It is quite clear that substantial funds are going to be needed to ease these countries ' transition .
The loss of customs duty alone is extremely high in some cases .
In Swaziland for example , this accounts for up to 40 % of all government revenue .
The European Union needs the same generosity of spirit .
In the light of this , the continuity of the development connection has been in the balance .
Would the Commission be able to answer that ?
I would like to finish off with just one remark for the rapporteur .
This is why South Africa ' s neighbouring countries can also benefit from European development projects .
Surely we cannot continue to work in this way .
This should strengthen the partnership between South Africa and Europe .
The Commission might like to comment on this particular point .
I would also like to hear from the Commission on how we can streamline the system .
The rapporteur has broken new ground on commitology which can only bode well for the future .
My group supports this regulation but asks for a speedy conclusion to the vacuum we are in .
We would not like to see any disagreement on budget amounts hold up ratification .
I must confess that the slow progress in Council negotiations for its renewal leaves me rather puzzled .
In 1995 , it became our key partner in development cooperation .
The fact that that country received most support from Europe was justified .
The Council needed no fewer than eight months to determine its position .
We are deeply ashamed about such a state of affairs , which resembles a cattle market .
There is another reason to feel ashamed .
I think this is disgraceful .
Poverty is an injustice .
We want the reconstruction of Kosovo .
We are happy to finance it , but not with money intended to combat poverty .
This is unethical .
We also support the second amendment .
This is why we give our wholehearted support to the rapporteur .
Relations between the European Union and South Africa must not be damaged .
The time has come to say enough is enough !
Cooperation requires a positive attitude of good faith and responsibility on the part of both cooperating parties .
On principle , I am always willing to discuss issues again .
I do not feel at the moment that Parliament wishes to delay the vote .
I would not be opposed to that and I do not reject that possibility .
I am therefore not opposed to the vote being delayed for another month .
There has been a misunderstanding .
The Commission was simply making a point on Amendment No 2 , as I understand it .
Perhaps the Commissioner would like to explain the point he was making on the amendment .
I said I would welcome it if a postponement of the vote were considered as a possibility .
It is totally in the hands of Parliament , as it should be .
It is simply in order to minimise that risk that I am expressing my views as I have here .
The decision is , of course , totally in Parliament 's hands .
That concludes the debate .
( The sitting was closed at 8.50 p.m. )
Decision on urgent procedure
I therefore propose producing a simplified report so that we can vote on urgent procedure .
Mr Wynn , chairman of the Committee on Budgets , asked for an opinion , has the floor .
Also , I have not had a chance to speak to my good friend Mr Westendorp .
Firstly , I should like to make it clear that the Committee on Budgets supports any aid to Montenegro .
It has done so in the past and will do so in the future .
On this occasion there is no urgency for this to go through now .
We are of the opinion that the relevant committees need to study the details of this proposal .
We should not be bounced into a decision because the Council deems it to be necessary .
As for budgets , our main concern is where the money is coming from .
We should leave it until next month .
The committees can debate it and we can vote on it at the June part-session .
Thank you Mr Wynn .
That is a very sensible opinion .
It might be helpful to verify this .
However , it would be an insult to the people of Montenegro if we rejected this urgency today .
However , we should wait until the Commission finally tells us where it intends to find the money .
It cannot take it away from Bosnia .
It cannot take it away from Kosovo .
( Parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
2001 Budget - Parliament ' s estimates
Unfortunately , the Commissioner has not yet arrived , although she is on her way .
I therefore propose that we examine the next item on the agenda .
What have we focused on in Parliament ' s Budget 2001 ?
I should like to outline this briefly with reference to five main points .
Both are provided for by figures in the draft budget .
That is the wrong way forward .
It is not the job of the budget to make such fundamental political decisions .
I am pleased to see the Commissioner is now with us .
I should like to thank everyone who supported me in this matter of concern .
That is the only way of achieving a parliament with an enduring public profile .
That is the right way forward .
We need to be a bit more realistic in our approach to the important question of enlargement .
We need to take account of that in our calculations .
I think I can present you with a budget which has earned Parliament ' s confidence .
There are three things which I would like to emphasise in particular in this Parliament Budget 2001 .
It is important to have a date when this facility will be available to us .
The last point refers to the question of the implications for enlargement .
We are aware that in the last Parliament a lot of work was done on this by Vice-President Cot .
His report was never released to Members .
What we also need to do is have a vigorous implementation of reform to prepare for enlargement .
That is a very long wait .
How are they possibly going to be effective with 25 Members ?
It is important that we plan and prepare .
I have been disappointed by some aspects of the report 's focus .
There is a contradiction in the rapporteur 's argument .
He has always focused on outsourcing of Parliament 's services .
Here we have an example of outsourcing that is not working .
I am also disappointed that the report ignores one of the biggest inefficiencies we have .
It also confuses the roles of the organisation .
Mr President , Mr Markus Ferber has produced an excellent report , on which I wish to congratulate him .
In the Budget , appropriations for wages are being increased by an enormous 12.2 % .
In addition , the Budget contains a significant number of new staff promotions .
Reallocation of resources is necessary , and consequently also reform of staffing regulations .
I will start by quoting and commenting on a number of political statements .
We support this and hope that it can be brought to a conclusion during the course of this year .
We must avoid hidden subsidies for European political parties at all costs .
Quite apart from this , the report also covers many administrative aspects .
I think that we should really re-think the system .
I would also like to comment briefly on the support which has been requested for the parliamentarians .
For example , the rent we pay for the buildings may increase .
As such , it is not really a criticism but I do object to running ahead of a decision .
I find this rather strange , but perhaps she has not yet said her last word .
We shall see , in time .
Yet on the other hand , in the Ferber report , Members of Parliament are awarding themselves fortunes .
We are awarding ourselves a second computer , claiming that one is not enough .
We are awarding ourselves a 20 % pay rise from a zero-growth budget .
Moreover , generally speaking , the objective is to reduce the budget .
But not in this case !
This paragraph does Parliament no credit .
We are in agreement and we are very happy .
We congratulate him wholeheartedly .
I hope that in September new appropriations will be provided for these lines .
We fully agree with the rapporteur ' s view concerning the linguistic staff necessary for enlargement .
We must initiate the preparatory administrative measures .
We therefore support all Mr Ferber ' s amendments .
The challenge which faces us has been described .
One can in fact do no more than repeat it .
We cannot allow the potential of this democratic and directly-elected Parliament to lag behind what the Council can do .
Nor can there be any question of exorbitant cost increases now .
Having scrimped and saved this money ourselves , we then need to use it to good purpose .
To good purpose means improving the potential and capabilities of this Parliament .
We are still within the 20 % margin which we set ourselves and we are keeping to it .
We shall accept this responsibility and take up this challenge .
Not because we are afraid of being forced to do so .
No , we want the public to know that we have nothing to hide here .
The basis must be clearly visible so that our citizens know what money is going where .
And it is needed .
But , when we are specifically called upon to move forwards , we should do so decisively .
So we need to get our act together and make preparations which allow for sound financial management .
According to one estimate , this will mean another 500 translators and interpreters .
No , preparations need to be made now .
We shall support the release of the Cot report - that is one part of Mr Elles ' motion .
What is more , that may be an underestimate .
Even that figure is awfully large , bearing in mind the number of new languages involved .
That is what the rapporteur is doing , and I think it is excellent .
We should also be clear about the fact that things are happening very quickly right now .
Mr President , I congratulate Mr Ferber on his report .
These types of reports are never easy and he has done a good job .
I shall explain why shortly .
I also have a loyalty to my political group which has given me this speaking time .
I am not saying that we have done that .
Not all the decisions will be taken when we vote this report through .
However , we are trying to reduce those costs , especially on buildings .
The policy of ramassage has been a great success for this Parliament .
Does enlargement require subtle changes in the membership and functioning of this Parliament ?
Now that the process of enlargement has been launched , fundamental changes are required as well as renewed ambition .
I congratulate Mr Ferber on the care he has taken over this work .
I broadly welcome Mr Ferber 's report .
The first , as other colleagues have mentioned , is the issue of languages .
I had the honour of sitting on Mr Cot 's working group on multilingualism .
The decision will be taken for us .
We were almost in that position with Finnish at the last enlargement .
So I want Parliament to rethink the 35 language posts .
The second area where we still have much to do as an Institution is informatics .
We have come a long way , but there are further benefits to be obtained from informatics .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon .
Presentation by Commission of preliminary draft budget for 2001
The next item is the presentation by the Commission of the preliminary draft budget for 2001 .
Access to new technologies is not very well developed in small- and medium-sized enterprises .
The preliminary draft budget also contains a new focus on foreign policy .
So now a few figures on the overall budget .
I stress this because it will certainly play an important part during the debate with the Council .
What does this mean for the European state quota ?
There are very positive growth prospects here .
The Council stressed the importance of this remit once again in Lisbon .
Is expenditure of EUR 815 million for the entire region too high an estimate ?
Now we can see at a glance how much is being spent on which political areas .
What is the European Union spending its money on ?
This is therefore a very important step , not a technical step , but an important political step .
In other words , EUR 3.2 billion will be refunded to the Member States .
These refunds will be offset against the contributions for this year .
So we need to take a good look at the question of exchange rates in the European budget .
Of course this will be followed by intensive debate .
I do not think that we should harp on about principles during our discussion of the Budget 2001 .
On the face of it , these relative figures alone , i.e. the percentages , are highly satisfactory .
So far so good .
We can support that .
But what about Parliament ' s priorities ?
That is perfectly normal and we have supported that .
I would have expected it to be higher . Information and communications have risen by 4 % .
But what about social dialogue and employment - down 4.7 % .
What about energy policy , which we have fought for tooth and nail time and again ?
You have cut it by 8.2 % and you have cut environmental policy by a hefty 28.2 % .
We urgently need to discuss this so that the budget also clearly sets out our priorities .
You wrote to us last December saying that a proposal would be submitted in the middle of April .
We are all dying to see it .
Thank you , Mrs Haug .
Remember that you will have many months ahead to discuss this matter and to speak at length .
Furthermore , this is simply a dream on the part of the Commission .
The serious discussion will begin in July with the Council ' s draft .
For the Commission proposals to be successful three factors will be crucial .
The first is the assessment of needs for the western Balkans .
That is why I say they have to be linked .
I will give you an example .
One area of great interest for me - I make no secret of it - is South Africa .
But EUR 12 million is a lot of money for the projects in South Africa .
Once again that would be a challenge for Parliament .
The third factor , and probably the most important one , is the attitude of the Council .
What happens if the Council is adamant and rejects the Commission 's proposals ?
But that is not for next year .
That is for the future .
In the meantime we await developments on those three factors .
Hopefully , at the end of this process , we will get a satisfactory outcome .
Protecting the Communities ' financial interests and the fight against fraud
Mr Dell 'Alba has the floor on a point of order .
Mr President , I should like to ask a preliminary question , pursuant to Rule 143 .
Some of us are starting to become annoyed .
I request that this be put to the vote .
Thank you , Mr Dell 'Alba .
Such a motion shall be put to the vote immediately . "
Mrs Theato , are you speaking against Mr Dell 'Alba ' s motion ?
As no one wishes to speak for the motion , the vote shall now take place .
( Parliament rejected the motion . )
I welcome this judgement .
That was my position from the outset , incidentally .
Unfortunately , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs did not subscribe to this view .
I said from the outset that members ' offices were off limits for OLAF .
Obviously , the Commission ' s legal service took a different view .
Now it has been taught a lesson by the Court .
The text which I have proposed is in line with the original proposal of the Committee on Budgetary Control .
I urge you to support this initiative to amend the Rules of Procedure .
They certainly would not have done so if they had felt that their independence was being jeopardised .
Three points on the content of my report .
Point number 1 concerns OLAF as an investigation unit which identifies and investigates suspicious cases quickly and efficiently .
The legal basis for this is in place .
Together with the Council , we have done everything within our power .
The development of OLAF is well under way .
Point number 3 concerns really effective disciplinary procedures .
This provision has never been applied .
The Commission is planning even now to delete it from the Financial Regulation .
That would be precisely the wrong signal .
We urge the Commission to reconsider such a move .
That cannot work and it does not work .
Except that the Commission wants to implement all the points addressed here before the summer recess .
I can only urge you to stand by your own decisions and not create difficulties where none exists .
( Applause )
First was the issue of definition .
The fact of the matter is that Member States have a high responsibility here .
My final point concerns the accession countries .
In the past - as we are now all aware - there have been irregularities within the Commission .
This opens the door to fraud .
Just think of the example of the collection of value added tax .
Under no circumstances should OLAF become nothing more than a help desk .
The immunity of members , for example , will of course continue to be protected .
I call on the Intergovernmental Conference to take our concerns on board .
We are fighting here for technical measures which , hopefully , will not turn into a long-running saga .
I know it is difficult to impart ideals and virtue to another person .
But that is where our efforts should be concentrated .
Because worthlessness soon turns into helplessness .
- ( PT ) Mr President , the current year is the first in which OLAF is fully operational .
There are many points in the present resolution which the Liberal Group can endorse .
We would call on the Commission to submit proposals to this effect as soon as possible .
Also , the date mentioned in the report is important , in our opinion .
OLAF starts its first full working year this year .
We will all have to wait and see what the outcome of that will be .
Expectations are naturally very high .
We must see to it that these investigations are carried out as independently and fairly as possible .
I would call on the Commission to submit proposals to this effect too .
They cannot remain outside OLAF ' s general scope of investigation .
We support the Commission so as to make this possible .
This anomaly must be resolved without delay .
Despite this , I believe that such a European Public Prosecutor ' s office should be set up .
Fraud is a scourge as far as the EU is concerned .
We think that the problems highlighted can be solved at national level .
The other paragraphs are about something completely different .
My criticism of the Bösch report , then , is the very simple reason that we have other instruments .
Let us take the proposal for an independent Prosecutor .
Mrs Theato attempted to have this adopted as a legislative initiative .
She did not succeed .
The Committee on Budgetary Control tried to do so , and Parliament rejected it .
This is not a proposal for a legislative initiative .
Probably in your own country too , and these were not exactly models of democracy .
So I would adopt a more cautious approach .
I think this report is a waste of a lot of paper .
What is more , many of the amendments seek to remove paragraphs .
Mr President , Mr Bösch has prepared a good report on protection against fraud .
What are we not allowed to see ?
What is the ombudsman not allowed to see ?
Will our rapporteurs be allowed to check on any payment from the funds ?
Lack of transparency is the fraudsters ' best friend and makes it more difficult to clarify matters .
It is other expenditure that we should be concerned about .
Finally , we should not duplicate responsibilities .
Mr President , I would like to join the many speakers who have congratulated Mr Bösch on his report .
I would like to distance myself somewhat from what Mr Mulder said on this score .
The steps required to fight fraud have been mentioned on countless occasions , including today .
I would like to highlight two .
The PPE-DE Group had better have a good explanation for this .
We have made a new start with the independent OLAF .
Mr President , my last point concerns the European Parliament itself .
This principle has been emphasised all the more by the revelation of inefficiencies within the Community institutions .
This is the reason why we are not in favour of creating a European Public Prosecutor ' s Office .
We must be able to have confidence in relying on the national structures .
No other area attracted nearly as much support for new initiatives at European level .
This is why the Bösch report deserves particular attention and support .
Allow me to congratulate you on this report .
Organised crime has identified the institutions of the European Union as a particularly easy target .
I am delighted that both the Commission and Parliament have included this question in the Intergovernmental Conference .
I require an answer and I should like it recorded in the minutes .
Mrs Theato , you know perfectly well what I am talking about .
The matter was discussed at length in the Conference of Presidents .
Do not pretend that you know nothing , you know perfectly well what happened .
That is the truth of the matter .
That has now been cleared up .
The immunity which we enjoy as MEPs must not be confused with impunity .
Mr President , I have to depart a little bit from what I intended to say .
He has a point and a minority of people in this Parliament agree with that .
Those problems exist and we have dealt with the solution to the problem .
Mr Bösch has rightly dealt with the problem of identifying and prosecuting fraud when it occurs .
I do not agree with all of his report .
Reform of the Commission is now under way .
In general , it is both visionary and realistic .
This idea is one we should stick to , I think .
We have had a lot of bad experience with internal disciplinary councils .
That is indefensible .
Both the ECHO and MED cases are all too well-known examples of this state of affairs .
Another panel would serve only to undermine OLAF ' s powers .
I cannot , however , vote in favour of setting up a European Public Prosecutor ' s office .
In actual fact , there is a need for a fundamental staffing reform .
It is , for all that , only the most serious cases which will have penal consequences .
Ninety per cent of cases will be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence .
We need changes to staff regulations and to the disciplinary procedure , as also proposed in the report .
I spoke for only two , but I am very disciplined .
I am happy to let someone else use my time .
You should also , of course , be allowed to make mistakes from time to time .
Mr Blak , allow me to apologise officially .
You are quite right , you had three minutes .
I was not wearing my glasses .
Do you wish to add anything else ?
Well that puts the friendship between Denmark and Bavaria back on terra firma .
Thank you Mr Blak for overlooking my error .
Mr President , this is just the sort of issue which gives rise to lofty declarations .
I think we need to amend and clarify the basis of the matters about which we are talking .
Mr President , I also congratulate Mr Bösch on his report .
One thing that is certain to create a stir in terms of the EU is big stories about fraud .
They always get big coverage .
That is quite right too because any fraud is unacceptable .
The figure that is being attached to it is about 5 % of the EU budget .
To give you an example , a farmer may fill out a form incorrectly .
That is not to say that he means to defraud .
It may be that he measured his land incorrectly .
There is a huge difference between these two things .
We need to have them distinguished much more clearly .
Let us not forget that 80 % of the fraud takes place within Member States .
Yesterday the Commission made a commitment to us that they want to cut irregularities by 2 % .
We want to know whether the Member States will follow that lead .
It is about time they signed up .
They have had five years to do it .
Let us see them ratify it .
Mr Blak stated in his speech that the citizens of the European Union are sick and tired of fraud .
As a result , such a move cannot be reconciled with the present Treaties .
Article 280 of the Amsterdam Treaty also makes this clear .
A conference on this subject is to be held in Ancona at the end of the week .
The Member States have indicated that they will not amend the Treaty in this area .
Unfortunately , neither bank has made a move over recent weeks .
Not that this was ever disputed for the European Central Bank .
I think that the new director of OLAF defends this view very vigorously , including in a personal capacity .
This too will certainly lead to further intensive and fruitful debate .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 12 noon .
( The sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and resumed at 12.00 p.m. )
However , for some technical reason , the services did not receive it .
We would be happy to vote .
In Parliament we have certain rules that are applicable to everyone .
They must be observed , and I cannot make any exceptions .
I must be frank and tell you that , even though I appreciate the problem .
I would like to hear the opinion of our rapporteur , Mrs Schierhuber .
Unfortunately , if we vote tomorrow , it will be too late .
Mrs Schierhuber , let us be clear on this .
You have just expressed your view to the effect that you prefer to have the vote today .
( Parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the vote )
Mrs Schreyer , can you give our rapporteur an answer in the affirmative ?
Mrs Schierhuber , the Commission has not changed its opinion .
The Commission presented this proposal as the outcome of experience in past years .
Our rapporteur , Mrs Schierhuber , proposes referral to committee .
Is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of referral to committee ?
Madam President , I should like to speak for the motion .
The groups have agreed that this is the only way of exerting any influence .
Madam President , exactly the same applies to this second decision as what you said for the first decision .
I therefore again ask the Commission if it has perhaps revised its opinion here .
Madam President , my colleague Mr Fischler made a statement on this yesterday .
The Commission has not changed its position .
( Parliament decided to refer the second part of the report to committee )
( Parliament adopted the resolution ) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTES
Rothley report ( A5-0130 / 2000 )
I was the victim of a road accident .
The most complex problem concerns the directive 's territorial application .
This matter is now resolved .
We are sadly all too familiar with the high figures of road accidents across Europe .
This is 500 000 too many .
Every insurance company will , therefore , need to appoint a representative in each Member State .
Martínez Martínez report ( A5-0114 / 2000 )
Yet South Africa presents itself as a beacon of hope in an otherwise turbulent continent .
EUR 98 million is not an insignificant sum of money in South African terms .
In terms of the European budget it is not something we would struggle to find .
Thank you , Mr Martin .
Thank you , Mrs Cauquil .
Jeggle report ( A5-0115 / 2000 )
In future , we must pay more attention to the needs of elderly family-based farmers .
The planned reduction in the monthly increments would therefore clearly be breaking our promise to the farmers .
A reduction in the monthly increments would further exacerbate the economic situation of farmers .
- ( SV ) A transformation of agricultural policy is a prerequisite for enlargement of the European Union .
- ( DA ) Agricultural aid is a heavy burden for the European Union .
We are forced to reduce aid to the absolute minimum , and we should have the discussion now .
Aid should not be reduced for the wrong reasons .
Schierhuber report ( A5-0124 / 2000 )
Basically , we must start to change the way we provide aid to agriculture in Europe .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of Mrs Schierhuber ' s report .
I consider proposed Amendments Nos 28 and 29 to be particularly important .
All direct forms of support for agricultural production ought gradually to be abolished .
Bösch report ( A5-0116 / 2000 )
It is absolutely essential that we change the way we spend our money .
Madam President , you have just congratulated the rapporteur on his work .
These particularly concerned all the sections to do with the White Paper .
We have had a lot of bad experiences with the internal disciplinary council .
That is indefensible .
Both the ECHO and MED cases are all too well-known examples of this state of affairs .
Another panel would serve only to undermine OLAF ' s powers .
In actual fact , there is more need for a fundamental staffing reform .
It is , for all that , only the most serious cases which will have penal consequences .
Ninety per cent of cases will be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence .
We need changes to staff regulations and to the disciplinary procedure , as also proposed in the report .
We were also unhappy with the references to VAT made within the report .
I did not vote , however , because of the establishment of a new control body .
( The sitting was suspended at 12.50 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
It has now presented it .
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and Mr Böge have drafted opinions on it .
In other words , we have been able to keep the BSE team going well .
So far you have presented no proposal on this .
Here too we need to take the Member States to task more .
But you have said that you have a problem with cat food .
Please say something about the risk of infection from cats .
I should also like expressly to praise the excellent collaboration between the committees and the rapporteurs .
Even scientists have so far avoided committing themselves on this point .
That is why the compensation paid by the Commission to beneficiaries must be quite substantial .
Commissioner Byrne is to be congratulated on moving that closer .
This would cost a great deal of money .
It would not remove a single additional suspect case of BSE .
I sincerely hope so .
Secondly , I want to congratulate Mrs Roth-Behrendt on a very good piece of work .
I also want to thank Mr Böge .
Nowadays , we know a very great deal indeed about the living world .
Life is not , however , complete , as it were , but is evolving all the time .
It is evolving not only in a positive way , but also in a negative way .
As time goes on , we are faced with new viruses and new problems .
The BSE crisis is an example of such a phenomenon .
There are , however , also many more examples .
There are therefore two things which must be done .
We must make sure that the situation does not occur again .
Such tragedies will clearly not occur in precisely this area but will crop up elsewhere .
We must have the same rules , monitored in the same way .
Everyone must be treated the same .
I am thinking of the last intervention .
The United Kingdom has been affected badly .
That would mean our becoming unclear and sending out false signals .
I would like to expressly congratulate Mrs Roth-Behrendt on her report .
My group has not tabled any amendments and is in full agreement with you .
We give you our full support and have every confidence in you .
After all , the proposal follows on from a pledge which was made previously regarding the follow-up committee .
This is therefore to be welcomed .
I would like to home in on the following issues .
Firstly , it makes sense to include regionalisation and regional differentiation in the goal-oriented fight against TSE .
If you are in any doubt about this , just ask my Scottish and Welsh colleagues .
These are cardinal amendments , to my mind .
It would have made provision for the necessary procedures and penalties .
We therefore oppose the Commission proposal .
This House must be vigilant in ensuring that it can never again be repeated .
The starting point for this business was the 1984 milk quotas .
BSE is the tragic product of the race for profits and the British farm model .
The disease has been identified since 1986 , but nothing much was done until 1996 .
The public could not be thrown into a panic because the Maastricht Treaty had to be sold to them .
In the first place , BSE has not been eradicated in Great Britain , and will not be eradicated .
Secondly , the belated ban on meal did not serve to eradicate contamination .
Fourthly , Great Britain and the industrialists causing the contamination have not , as polluters , paid .
That is the main lesson to be learnt from the TSE business .
Firstly , protection is always led by the states .
Secondly , the precautionary principle means safeguarding nations .
That is what we are doing here , Mr President , all playing out together .
Finally , the whole herd must be slaughtered if one beast is found to be infected .
Mr Böge , for his part , has ensured that these views will gain wide support in this Chamber .
She will appreciate even better than I how far scientific opinion on TSEs has developed .
Similarly , certain measures in combating TSEs have already proved effective .
Indeed , we take TSE and BSE very seriously in the United Kingdom .
We are committed to the safety of the public and to animal welfare .
This twofold concern seems to be particularly justified today , as French experience shows .
Medical and scientific uncertainty still prevails .
In these circumstances , the precautionary principle must be adopted to the full .
This is nothing new .
No public health policy should ignore these factors .
I can also vouch for the necessity of maintaining effective controls .
We already have enough and I believe they are adequate and effective .
This proposal simply adds more red tape and costs to an already overburdened industry .
Thus it is not new laws we need - we need more compliance .
We should wait to see what this inquiry says .
Her approach and hence her report is one we can wholeheartedly support .
Systematic testing precludes fraud and makes it possible to offer better guarantees .
The issue of slaughtering herds has been discussed at length .
In both France and Germany the whole herd is slaughtered if a single animal is found to be diseased .
I think this is not a tenable position .
It is important for the regulations of the various countries of the European Union to be harmonised .
I should , finally , like to talk about at-risk materials , these notorious substances which may present risks .
So this regulation is a good one .
It represents some progress , but it is capable of being perfected rather than perfect as it stands .
It does not raise any questions concerning the incineration of animal-based meal .
I think , Commissioner , that these are questions we also have to ask .
Allow me to say a few words on the debate .
We still have no tests for live animals .
Of course we need that .
We are not legislating just for Great Britain .
Which is why I believe that this regulation is a good regulation .
I will be the first to support it .
But I do not want this to be rushed , as is the case with certain proposed amendments .
This particularly applies to proposed Amendment No 56 , to which Mrs Attwooll referred .
What must the Member State do to qualify ?
The proposal also allows for the culling of animals and the compensation to farmers for loss of culled animals .
The principle of this approach cannot be faulted .
I make no case for leniency of treatment at all .
This is working .
Cases of BSE are declining rapidly .
That should be happening around about now , if it was going to .
No older animals over 30 months of age enter the food chain .
Very large numbers of animals die of natural causes or common ailments .
BSE is a degenerative disease which does not cause sudden death anyway .
This could well result in the under-reporting of cases , as we have seen in Switzerland recently .
BSE is not an infectious disease that is transmitted horizontally .
Whole-herd slaughter has no scientific justification .
The majority of herds that have experienced BSE in the UK have had only one or two isolated cases .
If one of those animals gets a disease , why kill the whole herd ?
Whole-herd slaughter is not an effective way of reducing cases of BSE .
It would cost a small fortune for no tangible benefit .
Mr President , I will omit replying to that particular remark .
With respect to Mr Martinez I will only say one word to him - sludge .
I will say no more as far as that is concerned .
That would be a drastic approach .
That is perhaps why our situation is much better than the rest of the United Kingdom .
Mr President , I would like to join in the congratulations to the rapporteur on her excellent report .
That is an issue which I have referred to before .
I should like especially to thank Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mr Böge for their huge contribution to this proposal .
I can think of no other individuals who have made such a positive contribution to tackling BSE .
They have both rendered an enormous service to the health protection of Europe 's citizens .
I turn now to the specific amendments and formal Commission position .
With regard to the recitals , I also accept Amendments Nos 3 , 4 and 5 .
It is not practicable to collect , incinerate and carry out a full epidemiological investigation on each fallen animal .
However , I accept Amendment No 52 .
I happen to believe that it is essential to maintain the flexibility of the commitology procedure .
That is the advice I have been given .
I also welcome Amendments Nos 38 , 39 and 56 to Annex IV .
On feed ban , I accept Amendments Nos 22 and 42 .
I identify cats here in particular .
That is the advice I have been given in relation to cats .
On disease eradication : I accept Amendments Nos 25 and 28 .
I cannot accept the second part of this amendment as it is in fact superfluous .
I should add that ADNS regions are too small and too difficult to control .
However , I propose to reformulate the text to ensure approval of the equivalent schemes by commitology .
I cannot accept Amendment No 55 to Annex VIII , reducing the protection measures against scrapie .
Finally , on laboratory techniques , I accept Amendments Nos 47 and 48 .
Thank you again for your cooperation .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Organisation of working time
Indeed , we finished up with a nine-year period .
We also were able to clarify the position regarding the classification of mobile workers .
That , I think , was another major achievement for Parliament in this negotiation .
Thank you , Mr Provan .
I think we can in fact thank all the Members of Parliament that were involved in this conciliation procedure .
My thanks go to all of you .
This has already happened in the case of road transport .
I would call on the Council and both sides of industry finally to resolve this matter .
Exemptions are only possible under a collective labour agreement or following consultation involving both sides of industry .
That culminated in the 1997 White Paper and the 1998 consultation paper and communication .
The power of codecision proved to be decisive .
In this case , we managed to keep the procedure within bounds .
I should briefly like to mention a point made by some of my colleagues from that delegation .
The first speaker in the main meeting was Mr Hughes .
One of my colleagues afterwards said that point was a powerful intervention .
Certainly it was meant to be .
That will not have strengthened our case .
A few weeks later , we did the best that we could .
But it is , as you know , nine years , plus two years , plus one year .
There are three main issues which I would like to concentrate on in the brief time available to me .
That was an important point of progress .
The second point concerns sea-fishing .
But of course that was to take account of the special difficulties facing one or two Member States .
I am confident , speaking today , that will be the case .
A further important point might have been missed .
The provisions relating to nine years for junior doctors only relate to the average working week .
The final point I would like to make relates to the transport dossier .
It is very important that we get movement in that area in the Transport Council .
Maybe the Commissioner has some news for us today .
The agreement will not be implemented in the near future at national level .
I would agree with Philip Bushill-Matthews as well .
I think the strength of having all-party support throughout the UK on our delegation was very , very useful .
I would like to talk specifically about junior doctors .
I am very pleased that they are going to be brought in line with the working time directive .
There are 270 000 junior doctors across the EU who will be affected by this .
A lot of those were going to Australia and New Zealand where the working practices were better .
We have to stop that drain .
The nine-year timetable , of course , is an improvement on what the Council of Ministers wanted .
It is far better than what the Council wanted which was the 13-year period .
I , of course , would have preferred a shorter time .
The UK Government , of course , was part of the problem .
They maintain that they cannot achieve the reduction in this timescale .
But as everyone else has said , it has to be in exceptional circumstances .
It is not twelve years - it is nine years and we must state that very , very clearly .
I assure you that it does change with the next speaker .
I consider that would be a real health and safety issue requiring rapid action .
That would simply be following the bad practices recently tried out by certain burger chains .
The progress of others will be monitored very carefully .
They have played an important role .
It was , of course , important to solve problems .
The idea was that seven million people should be brought within the scope of the directive .
I was especially critical of the agreement when it came to the issue of young doctors .
There was , therefore , not so much of a compromise on that particular point .
Young doctors do not choose these working conditions and working hours but are forced to accept them .
Naturally , we hope that , in reality , the process will be still more rapid .
I hope that this will continue .
There are ever more differences in the way in which working time is distributed in our society .
Working time puts the squeeze on women and children , in particular .
Young and old have different needs and different abilities .
Mr President , I join in the congratulations to all involved with this matter .
In addition , as Mr Hughes pointed out , the other parts of the entitlements come into force immediately .
I shall just deal very briefly with two other points concerning the whole working time directive .
Perhaps now is the time to look at this afresh .
It will also ensure that they can have equal benefits with every other worker in the Union .
Finally , I wish to pay my compliments once again to Mrs Smet .
I have one small , further request to the Commissioner .
The declaration was therefore a great help to us .
I would like to say one thing to the representatives of the GUE / NGL Group and the Greens .
The first problem was that they appeared unable to train a sufficient number of doctors .
If this plan fails too , then the whole procedure could take a very long time .
That is the problem .
I would like to know how the Commission intends to deal with this .
It is now up to the Commission .
The ball is now quite clearly in the Commission ' s court .
The Transport Council is behaving badly .
I wonder if the Commission can think of a way to resolve this .
More of this later .
That makes it all the easier to bring this directive about .
He - more than anyone - should be in our thoughts when dealing with this subject matter .
However , we should not be dazzled by the light .
This may be an improvement but I still have some questions to put to the Commission .
We have to recognise that there were good reasons for the initial exclusion of the fisheries sector .
The directive says that work at sea comprises sea fishing and other offshore work .
They are clearly not employees in the sense of the word that we would understand .
Is this directive going to affect them or is it not ?
I call for a similar exception for share-fishermen .
Hence the conciliation procedure which you , Mr President , were involved in .
I do hope that this directive can be implemented sooner rather than later .
One does not exclude the other .
We know that this overload sometimes gave rise to alcohol-related problems .
Parliament has shown sufficient flexibility ; Mrs Smet highlighted our legislative maturity .
I think , Mrs Smet , you have proven that we can also fight .
The results are acceptable .
But the transition period and the graduated plan are the maximum we have allowed the Council .
Directive 93 / 104 was already very restrictive as far as worker production is concerned .
It does not harmonise social legislation upwards , quite the opposite .
What is more , a number of categories were excluded from its field of competence .
It will permit further exemptions to the already excessive legislation of 48 hours per week .
We cannot support this report as it stands .
I will not pretend to be happy with this situation .
Some progress has been made and no doubt the conclusion of the conciliation has helped them in that regard .
That was unfortunate .
What we should have had was a quick decision and an appropriate reduction in working hours .
Well , the proposal does intend to cut hours , but by phasing in the cuts .
For the first three years , 58-hour working weeks are permitted .
Some restriction , even a derisory cut , in working hours is better than no restriction at all .
Thank heavens , my fellow Members have already said what needed to be said about the issue itself .
I shall come back to this point .
This is , however , an infinitely more wide-ranging issue , of course .
Mr President , I must point out how unusually tough the Council is to deal with .
Parliament made most of the running .
We are not proud of the result in terms of the content .
In a real democracy Parliament would have been determining the legislation .
Mr President , I would like first of all to make three political comments .
This was no mean feat !
Certain speakers raised the issue of the implementation of the directive .
I should like to stress that it is indeed a particularly important issue .
The Commission intends , with the cooperation of the French Presidency , to re-table the issue .
With regard to the issue of fisheries , the matter was raised once again by Mr Hudghton .
We have discussed this in the past .
I will try to clarify it .
I am afraid I was not clear enough .
The self-employed in fisheries is a matter of national competence .
That is very clear and very precise .
It is very much appreciated indeed .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Reviewing aid to third countries
The next item is the Commission communication - Reviewing aid to third countries .
I hope that is a problem which we will be able to tackle .
Very briefly , it is worth reminding ourselves what the background to this issue is .
We have seen a threefold increase in external assistance commitments managed by the SCR over the last 10 years .
The Commission has 2.9 staff for every EUR 10 million that we manage .
That is an embarrassingly large figure .
They have had to operate with extremely difficult procedures .
We have proposed taking urgent measures to tackle the backlog of old and dormant projects .
That is for the future .
The simple point I want to make is this : we cannot go on as we have .
In my judgement it is simply not an option .
We have to do better .
We are not bidding for a bigger empire .
They are the people who suffer as well as the European Union 's reputation .
I am sure this will be a long debate .
I would very much appreciate clarification of those two questions by one or other Commissioner .
We have done this without changing the portfolios that were defined .
My role on that board will be that of the chief executive officer .
There are two elements in this which will contribute to better coherence and better political consistency .
We have to get out of the culture of commitment and into the culture of delivering .
What we are doing here will be part of that change .
We also talk about ownership in our partner countries as being a major problem .
This is going to change as a consequence of the reform we are putting forward now .
Clearly continuing the way things are now is not acceptable , it is not possible .
This is the situation as we see it .
We do not want to invest our own role as Commissioners in fighting a losing battle .
We want to fight a battle we can be proud of participating in .
As Parliament is aware of this , we will offer our full support .
What will happen to humanitarian aid ?
Mr President , it is a shame that Mr Patten had to leave so soon .
I actually wanted to put my question to him .
That goes without saying .
I should like to know what your colleague meant by this threat .
Mr President , I am very sorry that Commissioner Patten had to leave .
In his absence I am delighted to direct my questions to the Development Commissioner , Mr Nielson .
I am delighted to hear of new innovations and reorganisations which the Commission is going to put into place .
EuropeAid would be a very important attribute of the European Union as far as our external relations are concerned .
Micro-credits and various other mechanisms are key to helping people to help themselves .
Firstly , ECHO is not affected by this reform of development assistance .
ECHO is going to continue .
This is clearly part of what we have decided .
This is a well established discussion .
We want to keep ECHO more or less the way it is .
I have confidence that with the new director of ECHO we are on track .
I noticed your choice of word there .
This is the message .
So saying it as clearly as we do here may sound wrong .
I realise that .
But there are other elements around .
We have to say it à tous azimuts .
It is absolutely necessary to make these measures clear .
Development ministers are not that unproblematic either .
This is our biggest problem .
We would welcome a little more competition as far as that is concerned .
That is not the case .
This is the goal .
Micro-credit is a big thing but it is not the only answer to all problems .
However , we are quite active in this field also .
Thank you very much , Mr Nielson , for your optimistic view of the future .
Question Time ( Commission )
The next item is Question Time ( B5-0220 / 2000 ) . We will examine questions to the Commission .
Question No 32 by ( H-0433 / 00 ) :
What action did the Commission take ?
These efforts by the Commission will continue .
I will gladly provide more detailed information on that , Mr Commissioner .
The question will , however , have been recorded .
Question No 34 by ( H-0357 / 00 ) :
All political institutions must rise to this challenge and so must the Commission .
Reform is therefore an essential precondition - a precondition for realising our vision of Europe .
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his response .
I would , however , like to add something .
Question No 35 by ( H-0411 / 00 ) :
What information does the Commission possess on these incidents ?
Has it taken any action in this regard , or does it intend to do so ?
Thank you Mr President .
Their inspection was carried out under its auspices .
Mr Commissioner , I am satisfied with your reply , but I would like to add something else .
Mr President , I am grateful to the honourable lady .
That is what I wanted him to clarify .
I would therefore like to make that request and condemn this violation of NAFO regulations .
He summarises the position precisely because the inspection has taken place and the Portuguese authorities are reaching their conclusions .
Question No 36 by ( H-0415 / 00 ) :
Questions to Mr Solbes
I am happy to respond to Mr Korakas .
So how are we to deal with this situation ?
Are you going to increase them ?
That is how we sustain our considerable lead in world markets .
Thank you very much , Mr Kinnock , for your cooperation during this Question Time .
I also say this from a Mediterranean standpoint .
Question No 37 by ( H-0409 / 00 ) :
This should also bring benefits for savers and investors .
What kind of large budget ?
Is it a large EU budget which is being considered ?
For example , Denmark has , in fact , on a number of occasions disregarded recommendations from the Commission .
In your reply - or comment - I note two implicit questions .
Firstly , a major budget is essential to tackle the cyclical difficulties .
Earlier I referred to the fact that the situation is different in each of the Member States .
What has happened with the euro ?
There are many technical explanations as to why we are in this situation .
It is true that the interest rate is not what we would have liked .
We believe that a strong economy means a strong euro .
It would require a very complex and profound debate to deal with this issue .
Question No 38 by ( H-0419 / 00 ) :
Questions to Mr Verheugen
Therefore , allow me to make a rather more general comment .
With regard to the basic problem , I would make a different comment .
Our concern has always been not only greater employment but also greater quality of employment .
Basically because they are two completely different types of figure .
Unless they all work in unison , they will not achieve this objective .
Thank you for your comments .
Question No 39 by ( H-0352 / 00 ) :
No-one has ever counted them and I cannot therefore tell you how many there are .
We usually talk of just over 20 000 legal acts in this context .
Mr President , there is not very much to thank the Commission for .
It is really quite simple . I have worked on it for a good many years .
So there is nothing to thank the Commission for .
I have no intention of arranging for them to be counted .
You tell your employees to count these legal acts , because I shall not tell mine to do so .
Mr President , Commissioner , the acquis is , of course , an important basis for accession .
Can you tell us how acquis screening is proceeding in your view ?
With which candidate countries has most progress been made ?
Which chapters have been completed ?
How do you assess the scenario if the legal inventory is completed in optimum time ?
This amended acquis must , of course , be included in negotiations .
But this happens on a regular basis .
The screening process has therefore been completed with all candidates .
Your question is based on a misunderstanding .
Screening is not the same as negotiation , screening is merely an adjustment process .
That has been done .
Now you want to know how far negotiations have proceeded overall .
A few more will be completed during the Portuguese presidency .
But more important than the number of chapters completed is probably the number of chapters opened .
Only the chapters entitled " Institutions " and " Miscellaneous " are still closed for obvious reasons .
They come at the end .
With the Helsinki group of countries , negotiations did not start until February of this year .
Between 5 and 8 chapters will be opened for these countries during the Portuguese presidency .
In all events , the process is proceeding apace .
I hope this question was not an improper one at this time .
Madam , what you wish to engage in now is a hypothetical discussion .
There is no point today in debating whether or not there might have been an alternative .
If there were , I would know about it .
But there is not .
The candidates will only see it as a serious breach of trust .
Question No 40 by ( H-0388 / 00 ) :
What transitional arrangements have been agreed to date ?
Questions to Mr Monti
Mrs Müller , the question is based on an erroneous premise .
You yourself know full well which industries are affected .
I would gladly do so , but I am not allowed to .
That cannot be the meaning of enlargement .
The region which you come from and the region which I come from are just such regions .
But we have not yet reached that point .
Having given this general warning , I give the floor to the Commissioner .
Now I am being asked to answer a supplementary question which very specifically concerns one candidate country .
All the acquis is taken into consideration in the progress reports on the candidate countries .
The Charter of Fundamental Rights cannot be taken into consideration because it is not yet ready .
Mrs Thors is raising a point of order .
I would ask you not to enter into a debate with the Commissioner .
What are the conditions under which services are provided ?
What are the conditions under which people are working ?
That is the corollary of free movement .
Mr President , I did indeed hear the words Charter of Fundamental Rights .
It forms part of the Community acquis .
Commissioner , we were in fact discussing the matter of transition periods .
My own personal opinion is irrelevant .
As far as linking transition periods is concerned , this happens automatically .
Basically their wishes concern transition periods .
It is a German problem and it is an Austrian problem .
Thank you very much , Mr Commissioner , for your replies .
Questions Nos 41 and 42 will be replied to in writing .
Mr Titley has the floor for a point of order .
Mr Titley , I will reply briefly so as not to inconvenience the other MEPs .
I am not getting at you .
There are two questions .
I am not going to get into a debate .
Question No 43 by ( H-0354 / 00 ) :
Such decisions must be taken within two months following the receipt of a complete notification .
The Commission would certainly prefer to be able to reduce this time-limit .
However , this seems at present not feasible for different reasons .
This will considerably simplify state aid procedures .
As to time limits , there are no plans to change the time limits in the near future .
You mentioned the problem of resources .
Question No 44 by ( H-0355 / 00 ) :
The Euratom Treaty does not include any clauses specifically prohibiting state aid .
It would only be possible to determine the incompatibility of aid following specific investigation of each case .
Thank you , Mr Turmes .
I very clearly understand your concern , but permit me some observations .
I do not think , therefore , that you can accuse the Commission of banning aid to renewable energies .
Aid to these forms of energy may , moreover , vary according to the Member States .
Question No 45 by ( H-0383 / 00 ) :
Commissioner , you have failed to answer my question .
I want to know what assessments you are making on financial aid .
You can provide state aids that are untouchable , even by a Commissioner as powerful as yourself !
But let me ask you what exactly is the situation ?
You said that under the Treaties there are derogations - and you quoted the Euratom Treaty .
There is clearly a distortion between Member States because of the state aids .
Where exactly in the Treaty are the written permissions for these state aids ?
Could you elaborate on that please ?
I shall try , Mrs Ahern .
First of all , if you allow me , I have here a note in French .
Articles 87 and 88 make no reference to nuclear energy .
I believe I have given you all the information available to the Commission on the subject .
That concludes Questions to the Commission .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.25 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
Carbon dioxide emissions from new cars
Of those 48 amendments , the Council and Commission accepted some in their entirety and others only in part .
The report therefore returned for a second reading .
It also seemed to us that they had not included a guarantee of the quality of data .
Another amendment which we felt was important concerned the dimensions of vehicles .
In this final agreement , our main concerns have been addressed .
The only amendment which was not accepted was the one relating to dimensions of vehicles .
I am glad that this one has gone smoothly .
Mr President , Commissioner , allow me to start by congratulating Mrs González Álvarez .
Parliament has asserted itself against the Council once again .
Some experts are advising us to try and stabilise emissions at present levels .
But we do still need a control mechanism so that we can intervene if necessary .
Hence : trust is good , control is even better .
And if they are not , then we must take legislative measures .
I regret the fact that it has not been possible to include light commercial vehicles in this system .
In any event , I congratulate Mrs González Álvarez once again on the results she has achieved .
I think that is a huge success .
I congratulate the co-legislators on their efforts in finding a swift and satisfactory agreement .
Therefore it represents an important milestone in the achievement of the Kyoto target .
Mr President , unforgivably , I have forgotten something .
Furthermore , I would like to thank all the MEPs for their support .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Interoperability of the trans-European rail systems
I think they are in the House and will arrive in time .
It is now 2.4 times higher than in 1990 .
In other words , freight traffic , especially transit freight traffic , is growing massively .
That is why it is important and urgent that we concern ourselves with the European rail network .
At the moment , we still have five different gauges .
We need uniform electrification , especially in relation to voltage and frequency .
The third , and I think the most important point is the safety of trains .
We really do need external inspection and certification agencies .
We cannot have a situation in which the agency operating the railway is also responsible for inspecting it .
What is the subject matter ?
Ladies and gentlemen , we must appreciate the full importance of this subject .
There is today an unacceptable contradiction between what is said in speeches and the reality of European transport systems .
Directive 96 / 48 was adopted for this purpose .
They have worked on the basis of the most general studies by the International Union of Railways .
Finally , during the transition period , it is important to prevent the networks from growing further apart .
The directive is even more important where conventional trains are concerned .
Interoperability will also have many advantages for both passengers and freight transport .
We are likewise opposed to involving passengers in working out TSIs .
Including these aspects will only result in the directive being difficult or impossible to manage .
This is an important topic , but also an extremely complicated one .
Mr Savary has taken good account of the views of others .
The rapporteur has quite rightly adopted a gradual approach .
Technical solutions can vary a great deal .
They are not necessarily inferior , but different .
For Finland , this is an exceptionally major issue .
This proposal is very good , but the solution remains half-finished , as far as Finland is concerned .
It will lead to unnecessary and laborious inspections of Russian wagons and to massive bureaucracy .
This gives me the opportunity to make a few comments on the environmental dimension to this proposal .
This does not bode well at all for the future .
The second important point is of course the social dimension , as I touched upon a moment ago .
I regret that we are confining ourselves to the bare minimum , i.e. working conditions .
This is now a thing of the past .
Meanwhile , railways are , however , in the process of being re-discovered .
The views on how to modernise the rail system are strongly divided .
The passengers are unaware that it is two companies who are responsible for this one joint and frequent link .
The position of the one million employees in the European rail system must be protected .
They are people who offer useful services to each and every one of us .
I am pleased that Mr Savary ' s proposals help strike a happy balance .
Nobody can deny its importance .
Most of their wishes have already been incorporated in some shape or form in the text of the directive .
This should not be done again .
Only clear agreements on qualifications for personnel who will be deployed on cross-border routes are necessary .
The curbing of the freedom of enterprise should not go further than strictly necessary .
We have made no progress whatsoever with interoperability .
I also hope that the Council will accept our proposed amendments .
I hope that the Council will do so and I call on it to act responsibly .
We are opening the markets but we need interoperability in order to do so .
The comment about industry is correct .
Except that , when it comes to American companies , the situation is quite different .
What we need is technical interoperability . That has already been said .
Safety is also , without doubt , an issue .
The huge advantage of the railway is that it is safe and environmentally-friendly .
In the race to develop infrastructures , rail has been the great forgotten area .
These are to do with taking account of social dialogue , which we deem essential .
I would urge you to support the amendments to this effect .
And new technical specifications for interoperability are at the forefront here .
The road-rail balance must be adjusted by means of a carefully calculated interoperability .
It is absolutely essential , in this eventuality , to have recourse to rail transport .
Interoperability is all the more necessary as rail transport is profitable over long distances .
Airfreight manages perfectly well without border stops .
So let us adapt .
We shall not be able to upgrade the competitiveness of rail unless we bring in stringent constraints .
The second figure concerns the average hourly speed of railways in Europe , which is 16 kilometres per hour .
And all this in the year 2000 !
However , it is not enough for us just to forge ahead with interoperability .
We should all realise that a common market without a unified transport network is simply will-o ' -the wisp .
The first problem is that Greece has no main cross-border rail links , especially with other Member States .
Mr President , I too regret the absence of the Commissioner here this evening .
Perhaps she is stuck at Brussels airport .
Perhaps she should have taken the train .
What is the problem ?
For 150 years , the railways have been organised along national lines .
More recently the railways have adopted 16 different and incompatible electronic signalling systems .
That all adds costs and it means railways cannot compete .
Differences have also contributed to the fragmentation of the market for railway equipment .
That will make the railways more efficient , reliable and more competitive .
It would also boost the railway equipment industry in countries such as my own .
That is why Mr Savary 's report deserves our full support .
Mr President , Commissioner , like aviation , the present issue is reminiscent of air traffic control .
Instead , we are now faced with the opposite .
Trains should not be confined to internal borders within a large European market .
I think that is important .
Liberalisation and competition should be introduced within this large European market .
That , in my view , is the best solution for customers and services .
I think that we need to take sound steps and take them fast .
A difficult issue was that of personnel .
Mr Savary , I welcome the compromise that we were able to reach in that respect .
This is especially important for those people who manufacture trains and train equipment .
It means that a fixed link is being created between Scandinavia and the continent .
However , we have a problem , at present , with different voltage systems .
We have different gauges in Sweden and Finland .
The only railway linking the two countries is that between Haparanda and Torneå .
Gauge switches are now being tested there to make it easier to cross the border .
However , there are also some extremely good examples of other systems .
This works well because the countries concerned have cooperated with the employers and employees .
Road traffic in Europe is increasing each year .
Railways are the means of transport which now best meets these requirements .
Rail transport must therefore become more attractive and competitive .
The Savary report is therefore very important and one step along the road .
It is now just a question of all the Member States turning it into a reality .
But still !
And yet the facts do not look very promising .
In this context , a word to my Austrian Minister of Transport .
The southern railway in Austria is an old stretch of line and is of regional importance .
But , more importantly , it is the north-south link in the east of the present Union .
That is in nobody ' s interest .
Let us end all forms of isolation and ensure that we have comprehensive interoperability in the Union .
( Applause from various quarters )
Therefore , let us deal with this issue when other points are under discussion .
In those days , military factors were given priority over the transport of people and goods .
For this reason , the transport of passengers and goods by rail has been suffering for decades .
Therefore , we resort to road transport , despite the fact that it creates pollution and is dangerous .
The inclusion of a social clause seems to me to be an excellent idea .
These workers have already paid the price for our forgetfulness .
Their number has decreased by 500 000 in the last 15 years .
It is possible to revitalise the railway , as certain projects that have already been undertaken demonstrate .
Rail transport is not really a great help in this respect , quite the reverse , in fact .
Let us be honest , the train has remained stuck in the nineteenth century .
In percentage terms , trains have certainly not retained their share in transport .
We can only hope that they have retained it in real terms .
Trains are not durable and they are no longer clean , especially the diesel locomotives .
Rail systems develop extremely slowly .
This should also be the case for railway legislation , right across the board .
This route covers Germany , Geneva and Italy .
Each country has its own set of rules regarding speed , safety and travelling comfort .
Only if these requirements are met can access be gained to the railway network .
This makes the interoperability of the European rail systems almost impossible in practice .
As a result , a lot of things work well within our countries .
However , the deficiencies become apparent as soon as it is a question of crossing a border .
It is just not an option to force goods or passengers back onto the railways .
Firstly , a diversity of operators is required .
Secondly , a distinction needs to be drawn between the national operator and whoever owns the track .
I would like to speak on this particular subject but from a regional aspect .
It is extremely important that we recognise the importance of a railway system .
I find that totally atrocious .
This is a very important link and one that has been upgraded recently .
Then we have the link between Belfast and Larne which links us to the rest of the United Kingdom .
So we have to take a really serious look at what we are talking about here .
I certainly want it within my region because that is important .
It is wrong , it is totally unacceptable that it is allowed in any way to be run down .
Above and beyond these measures , further efforts are required if the strategy is to be complete .
This has also emerged clearly in the course of the debate .
Most of the amendments to the report are acceptable .
A series of amendments entail actual added value , something for which we wish to thank Parliament .
When it comes to the amendments , I only wish therefore to deal with those which are unacceptable .
First of all , Amendment 9 , Article 1 ( 3 ) .
Amendment 28 , Article 22 ( 3 ) .
Amendment 29 , Article 24 ( 1 ) .
Where this is concerned , there are legal obstacles to acceptance .
Amendment 39 , Article 18 ( 3 ) and Amendment 40 , Annex VII .
Allow me to leave the other amendments , because they all have our support .
We must hope that it will be possible to adopt the directive as early as at first reading .
The directive will take on a key role when it comes to revitalising railway transport .
I now move on to the second report , which concerns the interoperability of high-speed trains .
Increased interoperability is a key factor in our endeavours in this area .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
British Nuclear Fuels at Sellafield
The response to previous recommendations by the NII was to ignore them .
Indeed , I have documents showing this to be the case as far back as 1981 .
This shows arrogance , even when they are called to account .
Surely it should have been the other way around .
He gave me a serious answer .
However , what about Euratom inspectors ?
Can we trust them ?
Do they also imbibe the cultures that they are there to control ?
Local people often ask me what the EU is going to do about it .
I can give them very short answers .
I believe the scandal of abuse of safety at Sellafield is a European question .
The THORP reprocessing plant produces continually more waste .
Reprocessing by its nature produces large quantities of liquid waste .
Even then , they will still be highly radioactive for more than 50 years .
I would suggest that this could be done by ending reprocessing now .
I have already talked about going native in regard both to Euratom and the UK inspectorate .
This is the polite euphemism for corruption , and that is what we must control here .
I would ask what does " urgent " mean in this context ?
The Commission is highly concerned with this event which raises questions in relation to nuclear safety .
The neglect of internationally agreed nuclear safety standards should be openly and firmly condemned .
It is also clear that our Member States do not wish to give up this responsibility .
That is a quote from their report .
We are now awaiting the formal reaction of the inspector to this programme .
Therefore the verifications performed by Euratom safeguards did not indicate that these declarations had been incorrect .
Therefore , also for the transport of radioactive material the prime responsibility lies with the Member States .
However , the Commission welcomes any decision which would increase even further the safe transport of nuclear material .
As such they would be unlikely to improve on current nuclear installations ' safety standards .
There are , however , several activities at Community level where harmonisation would be both beneficial and possible .
These activities are based on common recognition of national requirements and the promotion of best practices .
One area where there is scope for in-depth harmonisation is in relation to new types of facilities .
We have in fact set our sights and those of the accession states beyond such a level .
I am convinced that more could be done at Community level to achieve this .
I do not propose to go through those in great detail .
I have no time .
Let us not lose sight of the fundamentals here .
Regulatory safety mechanisms worked in this instance .
Members of the staff reported the error and then the regulatory procedures took their course .
Both of these are forms of recycling .
The regulators themselves are undertaking this job across Member States : who better to undertake that task ?
The result will be an enhanced safety culture and that is to be welcomed by all .
The highest standards are required of any nuclear installation .
I have considerable sympathy for the workers at BNFL let down by a sloppy management .
Their livelihoods were endangered .
BNFL is now in for a very difficult period and deservedly .
There are harmonised standards in almost every other aspect of European industry .
We cannot really contemplate enlargement without some sort of acquis communautaire in the nuclear sector .
The Commissioner says she does not feel it advisable to produce a communication .
Please come to our committee Commissioner and we can discuss this further .
There is undoubtedly progress .
I recognise and feel deeply the concern expressed by colleagues in the Republic of Ireland and Denmark .
My group cannot support the Green motion here tonight .
We feel that it treats the matter in too gargantuan terms .
But one cannot conduct this debate in the terms employed by the tabloid newspapers .
This is a saga in which nobody , least of all Sellafield , comes out well .
But it is an area where action at European-Union level really can make a difference .
This is unacceptable .
A strategic approach is needed .
Mr President , an essential requirement in parliamentary work is rigour .
This is the view of the British regulatory authority .
These have been welcomed both by the inspectorate and by the minister responsible .
I am glad that the Commissioner has reinforced that view this evening .
The fuel can be safely used for the purposes for which it was manufactured .
But to say all this must not lead us to be complacent .
It is the reassurance of public opinion that must be our main objective as a Parliament .
Mr President , I have been a Member of this Parliament now for sixteen years .
Our concerns have been expressed by successive governments to the British Government .
We are a country with all risk and no benefit from this plant .
I ask the Commissioner to reconsider her point .
We are joined in our concerns by them as well .
I do not .
I asked to speak because I want to try and help to get some truth into this debate .
No , it did not !
She spoke of the damning indictment on safety checks .
No , it did not !
She said the report came from a press statement in The Independent .
No , it did not .
The workers at BNFL raised the issue .
They were the ones who discovered it .
She spoke of contamination of the seas in Ireland and Denmark .
When your mind is made up facts only confuse the issue !
She spoke of the scandal of abuse of safety .
Those workers would not work in that plant if they thought it was unsafe .
They would certainly not put their families at risk it that was the case .
That is an absolute indictment of those people who work there .
Then she finished by talking about corruption .
That really is the last throw of the dice .
Let us be clear .
There have been real lapses in the way in which it has been managed .
Those lapses quite simply are not acceptable .
I know that there are many people who would like to see Sellafield closed down .
In particular I know this is a very strongly held view in parts of Ireland .
But that is no reason why the plant should be closed .
This true in Ireland , Denmark , the United Kingdom or any other Member State .
This applies in this case just as much as to anybody else .
I wish them well .
But words are not enough .
They must be matched by deeds - their deeds .
The powers of the Commission in this area as the responsible Community institution remain hopelessly inadequate , embarrassingly inadequate .
Nuclear safety in the enlargement process is a major cause for concern .
Realists accept and understand that life is full of risks .
What benefit accrues to Ireland for the risk of being exposed to the majority of Britain 's nuclear installations ?
To minimise the risk to these population centres of course .
Witness the BSE and dioxin problem .
Often questionable decisions are made behind a wall of secrecy .
I will conclude .
Serious doubts are being raised about the long-term viability of reprocessing .
A director has publicly stated the future of the plant is in doubt .
Mr President , thank you very much for an interesting and valuable debate .
I can say that personally I would very much prefer to have Community rules .
We need European rules .
However , we must not give the impression that this will be achieved very easily and quickly .
I share the view that we ought to discuss it more thoroughly .
I should be pleased to come to Parliament at any time to continue this discussion .
That is also why we have restricted competence .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m. )
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Mr President , I would like to make a comment in relation to yesterday ' s Minutes .
I do not appear amongst the signatories of the attendance register .
I would be grateful if this error could be corrected .
We will check the list , Mr Valdivielso de Cué , and make the necessary correction .
Documents were taken away , the telephones were cut off and threats of legal action remain .
Mr President , this matter is one of the utmost importance .
Mr Robin Cook is in Moscow today .
But we in the European Parliament - what are we doing ?
I believe this is worth sharing with the House .
Thank you for your statement , Mrs Stenzel .
( The Minutes were approved )
Broad outlines of economic policies
The Commission , however , has avoided specifying the ratio of investment to GDP .
This percentage is a familiar figure .
Obviously , we endorse the general thrust of the Katiforis report .
This is the direction the broad guidelines should be taking .
This is surely some mistake !
Finally , the basic problem still remains .
We have an ersatz currency whose volatility is enhanced by its non-identifiable character .
Formerly , speculation on the exchange market involved the pound .
Now it is the euro .
It would almost be like the United Nations issuing a currency .
Mr President , the report is self-contradictory .
However , inflation should always , of course , be between zero and two per cent .
We no longer have any need for elected representatives to devise the right policy mix .
It is worse than the sacred cows in India , yet the report does not protest against this .
That is an alternative recipe for economic policy , but one which is contrary to the Treaty .
Mr President , I enthusiastically support the further deepening of integration .
We must take advantage of the fact that we are in the European Union to do things collectively .
I wish to concentrate on research and development .
We need scientists in order to have research and development .
Let us stop young people choosing to do other things .
Let us encourage women .
Let us ensure that competence in widely-used languages is increased .
Above all , let us look at the salaries paid to scientists and technologists .
That is what makes them choose other careers .
Of course , we need infrastructure in science facilities and communications .
We need a strategy .
Jacques Delors spelt it out in his White Paper , so we do not need to reinvent his thoughts .
Commissioner Busquin ' s communication on the European research area is very good .
Let us be innovative in the European Union .
That would be a not very revolutionary but a sensible thing to do .
We must shake up the dogma of the Stability Pact .
Some say that political control of the economy at European level would be a way of resolving this crisis .
Mr President , the present draft resolution by Mr Katiforis contains many valid points .
We should , however , qualify one key point concerning a matter of principle .
Do we want even more ?
Do we really need so much growth or can we combat unemployment by other means ?
The lopsided emphasis on material goods is bound to have a detrimental effect on our society .
It stimulates egocentricity , social exclusion , a blurring of moral standards and moral decay .
The corruption of society eventually harms economic development .
Only since 1999 have both government expenditure and revenue fallen .
After all , the Kyoto Agreement more than merits compliance .
That is one of the reasons why the United States is doing better than Europe .
I refer to the remarks made earlier by Mr Lipietz for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
I have a shared concern about the jobs of workers .
That is a structural reform we must drive through .
It is not just in that area .
That is robbing the jobs of some of the poorer states who are represented here .
Unfortunately , spring had already started this year .
At the moment , it is just tacked on at the end .
I only have time to mention a couple of points .
The first is one which is extremely important to the whole problem surrounding the euro .
This is a crucial point .
What is missing , of course , is a political superstructure for steering economic policy .
It is these political consequences which are so crucial to the issue of the Danish people ' s consent .
We shall therefore be voting against this report .
Mr President , we do not support the Commission ' s guidelines .
Today , we are discussing in particular the broad guidelines for economic policies .
It has been said that they do not incorporate it fully .
The problem of full employment is patently one of our primary concerns .
It all depends on what we consider the objectives to be .
This is something we have regularly stressed .
A major point of concern throughout this debate has been the development of investment .
That is why public and private investment are absolutely essential .
Since 1997 , investment has been increasing progressively .
Some speakers have also mentioned the importance of research and development and the new economy .
I would like to make an additional comment on two points .
In my opinion , the greatest possible coordination is essential .
Stability and convergence programmes
This is the first time that this Parliament has debated the 15 plans presented by the Member States .
These include , firstly , labour reform , which we discussed earlier .
In the long-term reforms , we should also include the serious problem of population .
This is the way to tackle the problem at source , and not only its effects .
This is the only way we will prevent the old Europe from becoming a decrepit Europe .
This perception betrays a rather narrow-minded budgetary policy .
It is something in addition to the Stability Pact .
But they are higher in Europe because we have a social state .
In the debate we have just held we rather confused the three elements .
The Commission must judge them , but it is not our job to give instructions on this point .
These structural reforms in fact fall within the broad guidelines for economic policies .
I am referring to the demographic problem and specifically the ageing of the population .
We will also tackle the issue of our future obligations .
All of this will allow us to hold the debate which you have mentioned .
I believe that that will be the time to carry out this type of comparison in more depth .
Mr Karas referred to the Greek problem and the problems of sustainability with regard to convergence criteria .
In the case of Greece , exactly the same criteria were applied as in previous assessments .
Therefore , I believe that these concerns about Greek inflation are sometimes excessive .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Adoption of single currency by Greece
Mr President , Greece will be the twelfth country to sign up to the euro .
At the beginning of the 1990s , Greece was considered the sick man of Europe , economically speaking .
The rate of inflation exceeded 20 % .
The European Union officially described the budgetary deficit as excessive .
The public sector was notoriously mismanaged .
It must be noted that private operators have also discovered Greece .
In recent years , it has become a significant net recipient of foreign capital .
The stock exchange has undergone rapid expansion .
International rating agencies have improved their rating for Greek loans .
The situation is far from perfect , of course .
There are still problems , particularly regarding the restructuring of the public sector .
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs stresses the following points .
Cooperation between the two sides of industry seems essential in order to maintain a situation of non-inflationary growth .
Greece ' s entry into the euro zone does not entail any political risks .
Greece is entitled and , indeed , obliged to join EMU .
Mr President , let me add a few more personal observations .
I hope that the results of these plebiscites will be favourable .
There are some Members of Parliament who will vote against my report tomorrow , or who will abstain .
It must be stressed that the euro is a stable currency .
Such fluctuations are inevitable in a floating exchange rate system .
Even so , the euro has not become a weak currency .
In the last twenty years , the Deutschmark has experienced much more extreme variations in relation to the dollar .
In 1985 , the dollar stood at 3.5 DM .
The only grey area is a rate of unemployment which , although falling , is still excessive .
Financial markets operate according to their own particular logic .
This trend looks set to continue , as the Federal Reserve has just hiked up its interest rates .
If the euro is a weak currency , than the Mark was positively anaemic .
For Greece and the other members of EMU , the problem of sustainability is crucial .
Greece has a tax reform problem .
This structural change is pending , while our government is confining itself mainly to privatisation .
However , they are due mainly to the efforts of the Greek people as a whole .
Why did the Commission not take these skeletons in the cupboard into consideration during the assessment ?
Why does the Commission turn a blind eye to this ?
We do not need you to remind us that the Greek economy is weak .
We know it is .
No one should rejoice prematurely at the present vicissitudes of the single currency .
That is the meaning of Greece ' s accession , that is the meaning of its acceptance .
The Swedish economy is doing well - very well .
Mr Goebbels also points this out .
This is a timely reminder of something which is self-evidently the case .
If one is going to join the EU , one should not do so by halves .
This could have been brought out more clearly in the report .
The euro has provided greater stability .
This has benefited companies , especially small companies .
Price competition has increased , and there has been greater transparency .
The euro is not weak . Instead , it is the dollar which is extremely strong .
The euro provides Europe with economic stability and competitiveness .
There are very strong economic and moral reasons why Sweden should join EMU .
As far as EMU in general is concerned , we are in favour of real economic and monetary union .
Unfortunately , this union is only monetary , not economic .
It is MU , not EMU .
But the road is long and full of adventures , as the poet says .
We agree .
There is no danger to the economies of the other 14 Member States .
As far as Greece is concerned , our reservations concern the economic risks mentioned in the report .
Efforts have focused on improving indicators , not real economic quantities .
The competitiveness of the economy has not improved and unemployment continues to rise .
The rich got richer and the poor got poorer .
Some government finances are indispensable prerequisites for economic stability and economic progress .
I welcome Greece into the euro zone .
It will be adjourned for a formal sitting and will resume immediately after the formal sitting .
I therefore urge the Members not to leave the Chamber at the end of the formal sitting .
Are there any objections ?
That is why the Bureau proposed this solution .
I accept the President ' s words , but I must point out that there is some inconsistency here .
Mr Barón Crespo , I quite understand your objection .
Perhaps Mrs Buitenweg can give us her opinion , as rapporteur ?
The Council will be convening before our next plenary sitting .
I therefore do not rule out other motives which might be at play here .
If we fail to meet that commitment , what does that say to the racists ?
And my second point : we talk about the dignity of Parliament .
Ladies and gentlemen , I should like to make things quite clear .
I think it would not be right to vote on it immediately .
Madam President , I do not see why the Conference of Presidents should make the decision .
Mr Cohn-Bendit , I think you have not been listening to my suggestions carefully enough .
It goes without saying that only the plenary assembly has the right to make this decision .
It is regrettable that there have been administrative delays in producing all the language versions .
Joint motion for a resolution

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- González Álvarez report ( A5-0128 / 2000 )
I therefore support the use and preservation of pensioner cars as well .
It is better than nothing , but not much !
Despite its limitations , we nonetheless voted in favour of the González Álvarez report .
Smet report ( A5-0129 / 2000 )
The doctors will need to have learnt their trade well , free from considerations of working time .
I refer , in particular , to categories of the transport sector .
. ( EL ) It is a fact that man ' s strength and capabilities are limited .
Extending the directive is essential , but it is not enough .
We struggle greatly with the long transitional periods for the junior doctors sector .
Under certain conditions , this period can be extended by another two or three years .
These States may therefore be permitted an additional period of two years .
The maximum number of weekly working hours may not then exceed 52 .
These restrictions are no longer acceptable today .
That , then , is one urgent question to be raised for the forthcoming revision of the Treaty .
Ambiguities and inadequacies are , however , just as evident in the proposal before us .
Mrs Smet ' s proposal extends the general rule of 48 hours to some of these sectors .
until 2004 there will be no change , there will be no restrictions on working hours ;
between 2004 and 2007 the maximum working week will be 58 hours ;
between 2007 and 2009 it will be 56 hours ;
between 2009 and 2012 it will be 52 hours .
In adopting this text we are sending out a worrying message .
Roth-Berendt report ( A5-0117 / 2000 )
So let us combine practical action with a desire for improvement .
- ( FR ) I should like to express my satisfaction with the content of this report .
It incorporates all Community regulations in force in the field of TSEs .
- ( FR ) The problem under discussion this morning was first identified a long time ago .
Why has it been necessary to wait so long to effect the necessary changes in the regulations ?
Why is there this time lag between scientific discoveries and Community proposals ?
It is a perfectly good idea to make the use of rapid diagnostic tests more widespread .
They will be a significant component of BSE monitoring at Community level .
Let us not , however , treat them like a universal panacea .
They are therefore no substitute for , in particular , the withdrawal of specific high-risk materials .
Savary report ( A5-0113 / 2000 )
How could I do otherwise ?
Long-distance transport can only be regulated at European level .
Savary report ( A5-0112 / 2000 )
- I voted against the report on the trans-European high-speed system ( A5-0112 / 2000 ) .
The high-speed sector and the conventional rail system respond to quite different philosophies .
Only half of the Members of the very same committee voted for the latter .
This fact is , in itself , expressive enough .
We are a long way from debating the priority to be given to rail !
It would , however , be unfair to say that no progress has been made .
Even so , these achievements are still inadequate in terms of the issues at stake .
It is therefore essential to give a fresh boost to interoperability .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.20 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Adoption of single currency by Greece ( continuation )
The Commission has now concluded that Greece fulfils all the convergence criteria .
I am convinced that Parliament will take the same view .
Sweden , too , fulfils the basic economic requirements .
However , Sweden still does not fulfil all of the more formal requirements .
I am very well aware of the implications of the Treaty .
I look forward to that day .
Mr President , I would like to make a brief comment concerning Sweden .
There is talk of a referendum coming up .
Mr President , I would now like to move on to Greece .
I have a problem with that country .
The Greeks have produced a fantastic achievement .
I only wonder how long the effects of that achievement will last .
Greece probably does not meet the criteria any more or less than other countries did .
The euro zone should be able to carry a relatively small economy such as the Greek one quite easily .
But the Central Bank , for example , is not concerned with the euro ' s external value .
The true culprits are the governments of Germany , France , Belgium and especially Italy .
They do not introduce the required structural reform within their own markets .
Why is Italy not called to task when it makes a shambles of its good intentions ?
The large Member States and Belgium are trifling with the interests of all European citizens .
In the Netherlands , many farmers are emigrating to North America .
A weak euro lets them down badly .
Businesses within the European Union have become 25 % cheaper for the United States to buy .
I think it is time for some changes .
I will be abstaining from the votes today .
And I refer , in particular , to the Greek pensioners .
Mr President , the euro was born two years ago .
We are , unfortunately , the country without an EMU strategy .
That is indisputable .
For me , the reason for this is clear .
There is a lack of confidence in the European governments .
There is a lack of leadership .
Today we are studying the report on convergence , which deals with the Swedish and Greek problems .
With regard to Sweden , the situation has hardly changed since 1998 .
With regard to Greece , the situation is radically different .
Greece did not fulfil the convergence criteria in 1998 but now it does .
There have basically been two issues of concern : debt and inflation .
Are they sustainable ?
Is this inflation situation sustainable , or durable , as you call it ?
The second point of concern is inflation .
The Eurostat figures were also published this morning .
Therefore , in terms of figures , I believe that we should not worry about the Greek situation .
However , the Commission also shares the concern which certain MEPs have highlighted .
This is the end of a process .
When will the Commission enforce the Treaty ?
The Commission always respects the Treaty .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Solbes Mira .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon .
Transparency of financial relations between Member States and public undertakings
Mr President , Article 86 of the Treaty captures the very essence of the resolution .
Let it be clear , then , that the much desired level playing field no longer exists .
These are the considerations with regard to the proposal .
In short , what is the origin of investments in the commercial field ?
This caused me concern .
The Commission is , in turn , responsible for observing Article 86 .
I wonder how we must come across in a situation like this .
Those against this directive are thus giving the governments a helping hand .
My third observation , Commissioner , is on public broadcasting services .
This sector is very clearly covered by specific conditions .
I just wanted to complain about the quality of sound reproduction .
Can something be done about this ?
We will try to resolve the problem you have raised in your speech , Mrs Maes .
We want to thank Mrs Randzio-Plath for cooperating so well .
The rules must be applied in the same way to all parties .
An example is Internet connection .
These are very reasonable demands .
Both these obligations are simple means of upholding the rules governing relations between private and public undertakings .
This is important for the purpose of maintaining proper rules in the internal market .
My second comment concerns the actual purpose of this proposed directive .
I await the Commission ' s response on the matter .
Thank you very much , Mr President .
There are clearly opposing views in this House on this subject matter .
We must ensure that with the advance of new technology the public service broadcast ethos is not undermined .
( The President cut the speaker off )
This directive sets out to identify and prevent subsidies which distort competition .
However , I believe the final outcome will work and is a practical and correct approach .
Admittedly , an exception is made but then this exception accommodates further exceptions .
For example , it is very difficult for public broadcasting to survive in an increasingly commercialised environment .
I am against the commercialisation of culture .
In my opinion , culture is above these market laws .
The Commission has thus overstepped the mark .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Monti .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon .
Poor countries ' debt
We are all aware of the situation .
The whole thing verges on the ridiculous .
Peace between nations can only be achieved if there is balance .
Political and economic balance are , on the other hand , devastating to a world which is increasingly unipolar .
Mr President , hearing the other speakers , I note that we all agree on the facts .
The harsh and tragic figures are there for all to see .
The 50 poorest countries spend twice what they receive in aid in order to pay off their debt .
An average of 40 % of the budget of poor countries is dedicated to debt payments .
What action are we taking to prevent this ?
They were given plenty of fine words , but no practical action .
The Commission 's contribution to debt relief can be seen in the HIPC initiative .
It represents a coordinated effort by all donors including , in particular , multilateral creditors .
It was the first time ever that the multilateral aspect had been addressed directly .
Fortunately , we are mainly a provider of direct grant assistance and not loans .
The Community has since decided to considerably enhance support for the HIPC II Initiative .
In June , it will present the relevant financing proposals .
The first EC tranche will be paid in July .
The expectation created a year ago was that the G7 countries would come up with additional resources .
This draft budget needs to be passed in Congress and this is definitely facing some difficulties .
In fact , it seems very doubtful that the US will deliver its share as planned .
Resolution of the debt issue must be accompanied by actions promoting local development .
The immense repayment costs prevent any form of development .
Debt relief is therefore a matter of extreme urgency .
However , a very broad strategy will not get us much further .
The debt cancellation programmes must be tailored to the specific circumstances of each individual country .
If this fails to materialise , then foreign investments will not be forthcoming either .
We should not be naïve about this .
We can no longer write out blank cheques .
In the past , billions never reached the intended causes .
Last summer , the conditions were amended , with good reason .
Aid was made conditional upon tangible results .
Let us do everything possible to help the poorest countries fight poverty .
This can work if the victim is involved in his own rescue .
There are at least two questions which I think must be answered .
That is naturally not enough .
The Council responded by saying that it was not in favour of that kind of control .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , this year is 2000 AD , a jubilee year .
Such a year created the opportunity to start the future with a clean slate .
We therefore welcome national and international initiatives to reduce debts with open arms .
In this respect , it is desirable to deploy local governments and NGOs .
A careful and generous stance is a welcome bonus in this respect .
The question we are left with today is : what will come of this ?
The total debt burden of all developing countries comes to 350 billion .
This means that , in comparison , this 1 billion is really peanuts .
Well , here is one of the most important reasons .
One question which remains is : should you cancel debts unconditionally ?
In my opinion , conditions should very much be part of the deal .
The countries involved should be the poorest ones , to start with .
Mr President , we should really call for something to be done about this .
We should simply spend 10 % of the total development budget on cancelling these debts .
If we do nothing , the countries will remain trapped in a downward spiral .
Mr President , I have listened with interest to both the Council and the Commission .
I do not believe that to be the case .
This is therefore an example of the need for coherence and coordination between Community policies .
Unfortunately , this inspired policy comes too late , far too late .
Let us learn from past experience .
I am in favour of debt reduction but not on a level repayment or unconditional basis .
It should feature as part of an integrated and multi-lateral strategy .
It must be accompanied by proper management requirements .
Mr Da Costa , that is not neo-colonialism in my book .
As the Commissioner rightly says , the burden deserves to be shared .
That is an appalling fact for us to take on board .
So far , the United Kingdom is the only country that has offered 100 % debt cancellation .
Japan , incidentally , ties its debt relief to responsibility to buy Japanese exports .
This is essentially an issue on which there is a degree of agreement , particularly within the European Union .
This is the crucial issue : debt is a symptom but underdevelopment is the disease .
It is our opinion that these issues are fundamentally linked to development .
Mr President , I wish to begin by commenting on the necessity of conditionality .
I agree with a number of the contributions here .
All this shows that the fight against poverty is at the centre of this effort .
I turn to the matter of whether too few countries are part of the initiative .
There would be a number of adverse effects if we did so .
This is also the case for the billion of EDF money we are reallocating .
That part of it is highly welcome .
Otherwise , the European Union is the only one able to do something of real value .
Finally , I welcome very much the way this debate has gone .
Parliament 's interest is an important asset for the European Union .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon .
Situation in Zimbabwe
The next item is the statements by the Commission and the Council on the situation in Zimbabwe .
Various meetings have also been held with the government of Zimbabwe , at the Council ' s initiative .
The Commission is concerned about the evolving situation in Zimbabwe .
Parliamentary elections have now been announced by the government for 24 and 25 June .
This is a good sign .
The Commission continues to urge the government of Zimbabwe to hold elections , free of intimidation .
I had a very direct conversation with President Mugabe at the EU-Africa Summit .
I followed this up with a letter to him this week .
The international community , while condemning certain governmental actions , still supports the people of Zimbabwe .
Suspension of these privileges would be economically crippling for Zimbabwe and would aggravate the crisis .
But so far I believe we have followed the right course .
What a waste in a country dependent on agricultural exports !
The use of Article 366 should be considered .
All reporting of opposition parties is negative , with the MDC a particular target .
People in Zimbabwe are afraid .
Zanu-PF has the government resources , and the MDC supporters are too afraid to donate money .
It is deeply worrying that the opposition are fighting their campaign on Zanu-PF grounds .
The people understand that and are aware of it .
There is evidence also of this Fifth Brigade being involved in pre-election crackdowns .
Why have so few former colonies turned into constitutional states ?
Where anarchy and lawlessness rule , the law of the most brutal party applies .
In Zimbabwe , this takes the form of Mr Mugabe .
Land reform is necessary , of course .
According to the Zimbabwean election monitors , the incessant violence renders free and fair elections impossible .
As long as this is the case , the election date has to be postponed .
If the elections are not conducted fairly , European aid will need to be postponed .
The Zimbabwean population deserves a far better government than it has at the moment .
It is high time that the European Union spoke very clear language .
The black people of Zimbabwe are still suffering under the legacy of colonialism .
The legacy of this barbarically successful strategy can be seen in the chaos that is happening in Zimbabwe today .
We condemn the violence but we also see that black Zimbabweans have a compelling case .
It is a fearsomely difficult problem when Mugabe will not negotiate .
I was astonished to hear the speech just given by my colleague from the Greens .
Yet out of despair comes resolution , determination and hope .
It has a functioning civic institution and culture .
The opposition parties want more transparency .
Twenty people have been killed and more than 1 200 farms illegally occupied .
Mr Mugabe has lost control of the country , presiding over lawlessness and corruption .
On 24 June elections are going to be held .
Yesterday , the Commonwealth Secretary-General said that it is still possible to have free elections .
The future of the country lies with the young people of Zimbabwe .
They demand the elections .
They must be given a chance .
It is their future .
I would therefore like to back up the Commission in this opinion .
Observers need to be sent to Zimbabwe at the earliest opportunity , today if possible , rather than tomorrow .
Another worrying development is the reaction of the neighbouring countries .
We must avoid this at all costs .
Threats can never create confidence and social harmony .
Lawlessness can never create security and human solidarity .
Enthusiastic young people from our two countries met .
Put away hatred .
Do it for the sake of your own reputation , both now and in the future .
Do it for the sake of Zimbabwe ' s citizens , and do it for the sake of Africa .
First in answer to Mrs Kinnock - we are indeed in close contact with civil society .
Civil society represents a hope of achieving a civilised society .
But there is some way to go right now .
We are also in direct contact with the opposition .
I hope we can solve the problems of funding of the observer mission .
I have to tell Parliament that this once again demonstrates the inadequacy of our system .
We cannot just push a button somewhere in our system and the funds appear .
It is highly complicated to find the money for this in time .
This is the kind of system we have .
Yesterday ' s discussion about the external relations reform is even today relevant .
Let me finally explain to you what we are doing on the ground even in this situation .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday , at 12 noon .
Question Time ( Council )
The next item is Question Time ( B5-0220 / 2000 ) . We will examine questions to the Council .
I would like to remind you that we are 20 minutes behind schedule .
The rest will be replied to in writing .
We will begin Question Time .
Question No 1 by ( H-0350 / 00 ) :
I hope that this is in fact the case .
Should the Council and the presidency not have made a move to help Leila Zana ?
Mr President , on a point of order .
I should like you to investigate why this should be .
Mr Purvis , I believe that we should not enter into any judgement of intentions .
I do not know whether Mr Alavanos has so much influence with the Presidency of Parliament .
What I can tell you is that it is not the Greek Communist Party but Synaspismos .
That I do know about .
However , we shall continue with our agenda .
I will take good note of your question .
Question No 2 by ( H-0361 / 00 ) :
Turkey has not acknowledged the genocide in question and is still imposing its economic blockade on Armenia .
Mr President , I should also like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his answer .
This framework includes good relations with Armenia , especially on trade matters .
Question No 3 by ( H-0365 / 00 ) :
I would , however , like to mention an issue that is often overlooked .
The Jordanians are particularly sensitive to the slow pace of progress .
Commissioner Patten is determined to reinvigorate the whole Barcelona process and the European-Mediterranean relationship .
As the author is not present , Question No 4 lapses .
Question No 5 by ( H-0370 / 00 ) :
Will the Council now make a statement on the issue ?
Mr President , I gather that this question refers to the issue of culture within the WTO .
I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his response .
France pursues a very independent policy where the French language is concerned .
Do you see any evidence of similar tendencies on the part of the Germans , Spanish or Portuguese ?
As the authors are not present , Question Nos 6 and 7 lapse .
Question No 8 by ( H-0376 / 00 ) :
The current financial regulations do not allow for appropriations to be transferred between two headings in the financial perspectives .
The Council is currently studying this issue , which is highly controversial .
The Council ' s view is correct : payments to farmers are at stake .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , what do we do in this event ?
That is all .
- ( EL ) Mr President , frankly the President-in-Office leaves me speechless .
In other words , part of the CAP budget will be redistributed .
I repeat : they are unused CAP appropriations .
Question No 10 by ( H-0381 / 00 ) :
The article refers to the importance of political parties at European level .
This matter should be considered at the Intergovernmental Conference . '
Does the Council take the same view with regard to the legal basis for this ?
Will the matter be placed on the agenda for the IGC ?
Question No 13 by ( H-0389 / 00 ) :
This results , de facto , from the fundamentally ambiguous situation in that area .
- ( EL ) Mr President , Mr President-in-Office , thank you for your reply .
It was most interesting .
What I am hearing is quite absurd .
Except that , of course , they include members of the European Union .
Question No 14 by ( H-0390 / 00 ) :
Hopefully , it will not be too long before we have details of the proposals .
I did ask a specific question about fisheries .
Fisheries , unlike any other industry , depend so much on seasonality and weather factors .
Mr Gallagher , I am sorry that I did not specifically mention your point about fisheries in my answer .
They think it is just another piece of paper saying how wonderful they are .
We will be willing to consider all the opinions of small- and medium-sized enterprises .
Question No 16 by ( H-0396 / 00 ) :
The Commission ' s three proposals enshrine different approaches to combating discrimination .
However , subsequent regulatory development and the initiatives being proposed are incomplete and unbalanced .
At world level , we can be truly proud of the steps that we have taken in this area .
One of these groups is the disabled .
Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou , I cannot add much more to what I have already said .
Question No 18 by ( H-0392 / 00 ) :
More recently , at its meeting in April , the Council adopted three additional sanctions against the Burmese regime .
To this end , the European Union plans to send a second EU Troika mission to Rangoon .
President-in-Office , thank you for the answer .
I should prefer it if Parliament avoided the term Myanmar also .
Whilst I express my support , one thing still puzzles me .
We are waiting for the US to decide against these Federal laws .
Will that remain the case ?
Question No 20 by ( H-0395 / 00 ) :
However , Ecofin remains the decision-making body .
Thank you for your answer , which I think was important and valuable .
That is how the EU works .
Mrs Sandbæk , let us be quite clear about this .
Thank you very much , Mr Seixas da Costa .
That concludes Questions to the Council .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
Telecommunications / radio spectrum policy
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
The traditional telephone as we knew it is now a fading memory .
I am sure this has come as a surprise to many .
This has not happened , however , and instead services have become diversified and prices have fallen .
In some countries , however , implementation has been slow and even formal .
This initiative is impressively entitled : " An Information Society For All " .
The radio spectrum is a scarce natural resource which has now started to come up for auction .
We take a negative view of this with the exception of certain special instances .
Experiences from India are equally bad .
Your rapporteur is in favour of an overall payment for each commercial service which uses the spectrum .
We must not lose sight of the consequences which such practices will have on the final user .
He has drawn up not only a very concise but also a very hard-hitting report .
I want to focus on some of the key points highlighted in the report .
Just to move forward on some of the issues related to opening up the market .
To have an open competitive regime has now become the accepted wisdom .
We will not have a developed market unless we have investment .
That is something we shall address in the next communication .
There was no such consensus previously .
Even foreign calls were ten per cent lower than previously .
We are therefore still making quite large strides in this area .
The Commission is undertaking many investigations and inquiries .
These two reports deal with issues both large and small .
In certain Member States , that is already the case , for example in my own country , Finland .
The auctions issue has provoked discussion and does so every day .
There is a risk of roaming for third generation mobile telephony being put in jeopardy .
There may also be a risk of barriers arising between the Member States .
Mr President , there has been a change over to electronic capitalism , both in Europe and worldwide .
I must say that the assessment presented to us is , at least , detailed .
The EU ' s operating logic thus falls into two stages .
The Commission is addressing many of these problems which you identify at the moment .
It has the very recent recommendation on the local loop and on bundling .
The Commission will also use its powers in regard to competition to monitor carefully dominant positions .
Parliament ' s report will provide important input .
Cable systems will be examined more closely by the Commission .
For that reason , the Commission proposes a harmonised approach .
The Commission therefore welcomes the report from Mr Alyssandrakis .
The competitiveness of European industry at global level must be developed in the interest of the European citizen .
Mrs Read put a question about the balance between competition and regulation .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Liikanen .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Coherent European approach for space
At the same time , it has brought practical applications which have changed our lives .
Space is the one sector in which international cooperation is particularly important .
The Commission has made it clear that a coherent approach is indispensable for the European Union .
This structure comprises the Space Advisory Group and other high-level groups .
Satellites and telecommunications have been mentioned , and we could add the weather forecast .
The Commission must put forward measures to control what are genuine abuses .
This is the only way to achieve the consensus such a policy requires .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioners , the European market for space applications is fragmented .
There are many smaller companies active which do not work together very well .
There is , as such , plenty of work for the space advice group .
Cooperation at Community and international level in space activities is imperative .
My second point concerns the position of the European satellite industry .
The sector is growing by 10 % annually and thus helping create employment .
Unfortunately , the European satellite industry is very much dominated by governments .
All this noise is making things very difficult : the sound quality is dreadful .
I would appreciate it if the technicians could do something about it .
Thank you , Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel .
Let us hope that the sound quality will be better tomorrow .
I am 55 years old and in 15 years ' time I will be 69 .
I am booking my seat today !
Thank you very much , Commissioner Busquin .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon .
European research area
It comes at exactly the right time , between two framework programmes .
At present , there is no European research area as such .
In addition , we invest far less in research than the United States and Japan .
The forthcoming enlargement of the Union makes this all the more pressing .
This means that European researchers need access to each other ' s national programmes .
Only 10 % is spent on new innovative research .
As such , the framework programme certainly makes a considerable contribution to this 10 % .
A better link is required between the development of new technology and application in the market .
It creates employment and prosperity .
Universities and companies therefore need to work more closely together .
Commissioner Busquin has now indicated how a European research area could be brought about .
Infrastructures do not innovate , neither do electronic networks , although they are a prerequisite .
In my view , the potential of women has been neglected for too long in this respect .
My final point concerns the lack of a Community patent .
The existing European patent system causes fragmentation and leads to considerable extra costs .
Will the Commissioner consult Mr Bolkestein to do something about this ?
After all , small- and medium-sized companies do not have the means to pay for expensive legal procedures .
I would like to thank my colleagues for their kind cooperation .
It is mentioned in clauses ' n ' and ' o ' of the preamble .
I am very grateful for that .
The whole is better than the sum of its two parts .
It was very good of her to work it in so effectively .
There is indeed a European crisis in research funding .
We must increase it .
Legal devices are important .
We should improve the European patent .
They are the people at the sharp end .
We also need other things .
The omens are not entirely good .
All that is stated in paragraph 40 of the report .
It has never been taken up industrially .
Many good ideas that are developed do not get taken up .
That is also vital .
I have the pleasure of shadowing Mr MacCormick in the Legal Affairs Committee .
That activity cannot really be achieved by a lot of centralisation .
The Commission has a job to do as a catalyst for the process .
We have now fantastic new tools to be able to do that .
The second point I want to make links in with our competitiveness .
We have to improve the ways that we do that .
As things are now , resources are wasted due to overlapping and lack of coordination .
Even worse is the fact that the gap with respect to the USA is widening .
While I have the floor , I would like to bring up a few additional points .
I would prefer to talk about cooperation or strategy , rather than research policy .
The word policy has a connotation of activities being closely controlled by Brussels .
The participation of women in scientific research within the EU continues to be too fragmented .
More tangible action must be incorporated in the programmes in order to promote this participation .
Researcher exchange programmes and interaction between research teams are matters which deserve our full support .
The COST secretariat has already produced some commendable work .
Its position as research coordinator should be further strengthened .
I wish to thank Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel for her very dynamic work on this report .
Both fundamental and applied research must , above all , retain public support and a public dimension .
Europe may be a significant driving force in this field .
In this respect , there is also a need for serious thinking about the STOA .
The twenty-first century will be the century of knowledge and grey matter .
According to the figures made available by the Commission , Europe is definitely lagging behind the United States .
The first is that European investment in research is at least as important as the European research area .
In the United States , there is rather less concern for semantics and more for practical action .
Research is , first and foremost , a matter for freedom and not for planning .
This is all included in the Commission communication and the report by our fellow Member .
This prioritisation should focus primarily on researchers and businesses .
As far as researchers are concerned , their standard of living throughout Europe must be enhanced .
As far as businesses are concerned , research work must be encouraged .
This is what our approach must be .
So the area ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
We are looking forward to seeing his analysis of the results of the consultation .
It is itself a centre of excellence in many areas .
I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on his ambition , which is considerable .
This is evident to all of us , yet our governments fail to set aside sufficient funds .
This is true for the Member States and regions , some of whose percentage levels are shamefully low .
This is why it is good to emphasise cooperation .
Cooperation , however , requires organisation .
And really , the absence of this is something we only have ourselves to blame for .
We cannot do this to the Commissioner either .
Dear Commissioner , what a challenge !
But I would prefer it if we were a little more precise in our debate .
We have to ascertain that not all research leads to more economic growth or more employment .
In these particular areas , European cooperation is meaningful .
The Joint Research Centres , the JRCs , have many examples of sound cooperation projects .
I would like to finish off by saying a few words on basic research .
Research situated between applied and basic research now has a lower profile but remains significant .
It is precisely in these spheres that coordination of national research efforts is of major importance .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her invaluable work .
The Commission ' s communication provides an unnecessarily one-sided view of the challenges of European research .
It is not enough to talk in broad terms about the competitiveness of the Union .
I am the only person from that committee who is speaking in this debate .
In this respect I would like to offer some constructive criticism .
In Europe there are no training programmes for researchers .
FEDER and the FEDER projects do not cover grant holders .
How can we talk about mobility if we do not have researchers ?
I repeat that we must recycle our teachers .
Only by means of a strategic European resources plan can we do so .
Lastly , I would like to express my fear that only centres of excellence will be recognised .
The first concerns the close relationship between research , economic growth and employment .
Point two : research and development have generated an extremely well integrated system .
These two aspects are closely linked .
In order to create the necessary dynamic , it is therefore essential to develop the concept of benchmarking .
Mr Bolkestein , who is responsible for the internal market , is well aware of this .
So , to be brief , I should simply like to inform Parliament of the forthcoming stages .
The first stage is clear .
I would first of all like to emphasise just how important it was that Parliament expressed its opinion today .
This report will provide practical examples to support the determination that we must display .
For I have clearly understood that practical action is needed .
So , regarding the practical action , let me quickly list a few points , starting with benchmarking .
With national research policies , the methodology exists .
Initial results will be available by the end of the year .
That is no surprise to anyone , I think .
The mobility of researchers presupposes the mobility of workers in general .
Thank you very much for your contribution , Commissioner .
Given the time , we should not hold lengthy discussions .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Peking action platform
Europe has done this in the past and we must be able to continue to do this .
No statistical data exists .
After all , there is an enormous gap in this field .
I would like to direct my second point to Parliament itself .
It may be useful that we , together with the women involved , should take an initiative .
That is all I have to say as regards assessment and I will not touch on it any further .
This was also said a moment ago .
Another theme is decision making .
I think that efforts should also be made with regard to both sides of industry .
Women are very much absent in the media .
Finally , I already said that Europe is expected to play a pioneering role .
I would mention two areas , in particular .
We are now familiar with this .
This much we now know .
What is happening in Afghanistan is unjustifiable .
The social changes of recent years have affected women in a special way .
The majority and , in many cases , all of the responsibility for domestic tasks falls to women .
The cooperation of the media is essential to achieving these objectives .
But the heavens are not enough .
That is unacceptable .
Just about all the governments of the world endorsed the Beijing Conference ' s action plan .
These three tools have so far been missing in implementing the Beijing Action Platform .
Is that not so , Commissioner ?
Women are , to a very great extent , the victims and those who suffer in wars now .
I should like , however , to point out a number of things .
Economic independence for women is a necessity if it is to be possible to achieve true equality .
These are points which religious fundamentalists of different kinds now refuse to accept .
They are thereby sabotaging constructive dialogue between governments and voluntary organisations .
The European Union and the Member States must be on the front line of this fight .
Five years on from Beijing , we shall be assessing the past five years .
One question which arises is whether or not we have the information needed at European Union level .
That was the reason for the delay .
I should like to stress that Beijing will obviously give rise to negotiating problems .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
( The sitting was closed at 11.53 p.m. )
Address by Mr Kuçan , President of the Republic of Slovenia
And a free and democratic Slovenia was born .
The European Union is first and foremost a Community based on values .
And now Slovenia belongs to the greater European family which we hope to bring together in the near future .
On 10 June 1996 , your country submitted its formal application for membership of the European Union .
I am therefore particularly pleased to welcome you here today .
You are most welcome , Mr President , and without further ado I shall give you the floor .
That was the day when the process of European integration began .
It is your and our common European day of celebration , and I offer you my sincere congratulations .
This idea seems to me particularly important , for it emphasises coexistence .
Yet the question is : what will coexistence be founded upon ?
These are the laws of the global community .
Politics is lagging behind this trend .
In the ruins of the Berlin Wall , however , traces of new divisions are appearing in Europe .
In real life , several Europes exist .
Some of them will not get there without help .
They would prefer to toy with the project of a new ideological division of Europe .
We may call this the fourth Europe .
The possibility of bloody military clashes is still real .
This puts pressure on fundamental values , and threatens coexistence and our common future .
Insensitivity to these phenomena would create new barriers between us .
We are reminded of this by the experience we carry with us .
There are ever increasing signs of the emergence of two classes in society .
The world is beginning to divide in a new way .
They are threatened with social exclusion , stagnation and marginalisation .
Of course , we are not responding in entirely the same way .
Nevertheless , it is essential that in seeking answers we all proceed from the same value system .
The common cornerstones of values for coexistence have been established .
Now everyone must be afforded the chance to live in accordance with those values .
This frame of mind would be the best guarantee that intolerance and enmity remain a marginal phenomenon .
Such an event would demand common action , without wavering or compromise .
The NATO intervention in Kosovo is perhaps the first step in this direction .
The value of fundamental human rights was placed above the value of classic state sovereignty .
It is becoming a subject of responsibility for the international community .
Europe , and in particular the EU , should not be in two minds about this .
It is the turn of countries that , because of this , have lagged behind in their economic development .
It would also indicate that Europe is abandoning its influence and presence in the world .
They are moving from the entirely known to the not entirely known .
Could it be perhaps that once again the special interests of individual Member States are rising to the surface ?
Dilemmas , doubts and uncertainties are also emerging among the candidate countries .
With its back to the wall , Slovenia signed the so-called ' Spanish compromise ' .
Slovenia is a small nation .
The worst thing of all was the aggression during the time of the Nazi and Fascist occupation .
Our right to existence as a nation was taken away .
In order for the current goals to be achieved , negotiations should be concluded next year .
We are convinced that the current progress in negotiations should make this possible .
The positive effects of these processes are interdependent on the simultaneously establishing freedom of individuation and fragmentation .
Only respect for such freedoms can be the foundation of European coexistence .
This involves establishing the principle of ' unity in diversity ' .
The alternative is clear .
My firm conviction is that united Europeans could be more than a match for these trials .
Thank you , Mr President , for addressing us in forceful , committed and frank terms .
Thank you , too , for mentioning the visit I made to Ljubljana a few weeks ago .
You also mentioned unity in diversity .
Once again , I think your views are in total accord with the objectives of the European Parliament .
I wish you and also the Slovene authorities participating in the negotiations the very best of luck .
We sincerely hope that these negotiations will come to a successful conclusion within the expected time limits .
( The formal sitting was closed at 12.30 p.m. )
We cannot create a Europe which does not condemn the atrocities perpetrated by Communism and Nazism .
We entrust the matter to your wisdom and authority .
Thank you , Mrs Napoletano .
Statements by the President
I have two statements to make .
The Quaestors acted quickly to resolve this situation in the best way possible .
You should therefore have received this statement by e-mail .
I thank Mrs Palacio , the committee ' s chairperson , and the committee members for their efforts .
Once again , I thank her .
I intend to abide by the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee .
If you will allow me , I will justify my proposal .
Go ahead , Mr Barón Crespo .
One of them is respect for parliamentary rules and the Treaties .
( The President cut the speaker off )
( The sitting was suspended at 10.20 a.m. and resumed at 10.40 a.m. )
I thank the two Members who are doctors for taking immediate action and for giving me this information .
This sort of thing could happen to any of us so we definitely need to do something .
Madam President , we have all been deeply distressed by the illness of our colleague .
Many colleagues are finding it particularly difficult this week in the heat .
Thank you , Mrs Banotti .
I believe there are no age limits for this type of illness .
I am very satisfied with the time that was taken and the action of Parliament ' s medical services .
Ladies and gentlemen , we trust that the Quaestors will look into the matter .
However , we have all made a free choice .
France is a constitutional state .
There certainly are precedents and my Group believes they should be respected .
I respect what Mr Barón Crespo says .
His views were discussed and examined in depth by the Legal Affairs Committee .
Allow me to refer to what was said in this committee .
It makes no sense now to look into the reason for the sentence .
The sentence exists .
The fact that it involves ineligibility is what concerns us .
Please allow me now to refute Mr Medina ' s statement on his interpretation of the matter .
However , in my capacity as chairperson , I must point out that the two letters are complementary .
The vote had already taken place in the Legal Affairs Committee .
I say this in order to refute these statements .
I would now like to make a comment in relation to the Rules of Procedure .
Madam President , Rule 7 ( 4 ) is being cited .
Madam President , there is no proposal to the plenary here .
( Noise )
It is absolutely irregular and contrary to the Rule that has been cited ...
( Applause )
( Protests )
( Protests )
( The President cut the speaker off )
( Protests and the President cut the speaker off )
Ladies and gentlemen , we are not going to repeat the discussions of the Legal Affairs Committee .
I accept full responsibility in this matter .
Under the terms of the Treaty I could no doubt have quite simply noted the decree .
You can imagine the problems this would cause !
This is therefore an extremely important responsibility for both your President and this House .
Now that I have this opinion , I could ignore it .
This , effectively , is what our Rules of Procedure say .
This is my proposal .
We are not going to spend the whole morning on this .
I would ask you to be brief and we will then take whatever seems to be the best decision .
This decision is yours to make as this is a very serious issue .
We are fully aware of the political sensitivity of this issue .
Mrs Hautala , we must be very clear on this .
It is not a question of voting to waive anybody ' s immunity .
Is this now clear to everyone ?
( Mixed reactions ) But the letter will be provided to you .
This is a case for absolute objectivity and attention to the rules .
( Mixed reactions ) This is what happened .
Madam President , I wish to raise a procedural motion .
I must remind Mr Wurtz that a tribunal does not deliver judgements .
A court delivers judgements .
He should brush up on his legal knowledge .
That apart , the Legal Affairs Committee rightfully discussed this issue and Mr Wurtz was not there .
There was political confusion but no legal confusion .
The position of the Legal Affairs Committee was simple .
The decision is not final and therefore cannot be accepted .
Ladies and gentlemen , I have received many requests to speak .
We absolutely must find the best solution .
We are now in a difficult position .
We must resolve this situation .
I will therefore immediately put the two possible solutions to the vote .
We do not have such a document .
The President is right .
I do not often agree with Mrs Garaud but in this case she is right .
Understand that if you can , but it is up to the French Parliament to reform this law .
The European Parliament is also sovereign and can adopt a position contrary to a state decision .
This is my conception of Europe .
This can happen very quickly .
We should not be presenting the public with a spectacle of that kind .
That is your right .
There is a legal problem here that only you can clear up .
There is a discrepancy here .
My advice is that we need to clear up this discrepancy .
That is your task , Madam President .
( Applause )
I agree with Mr Hänsch .
This is the best solution for everyone .
The latter , Madam President , was unfortunately not the case .
As I understand , the French version was still not available this morning .
Madam President , on a point of order .
I wish to make three brief points .
I myself was absent , but I have had this confirmed to me .
That is my first question .
He is perfectly correct to insist on the application of that rule , if he should so wish .
I should like to have that confirmed .
Thank you , Mr Cox .
It is quite clear that we are not within the time limit established in Rule 115 .
It is now 23.5 hours later .
Mr Poettering , the law affecting any given issue is subject to interpretation .
That is another issue .
We agree .
I am now looking to see whether the deadlines would be respected in this case .
They would .
I therefore put Mr Cox ' s proposal , as accepted by the rapporteur , to the vote .
I would ask you to accept this request .
This really is a mess !
At what time will it start ?
I have a right to know .
Trafficking in women
Trafficking in children does exist , but they are used as adults .
Men , too , are victims of trafficking in people and are sexually abused .
Victims are also recruited for the marriage market , as well as to sports clubs and football clubs .
Victims are often unable to speak out on account of the illegal situation they are in .
Various initiatives have already been taken at European level .
As I said , trafficking in people is not just about the problem of demand for prostitution .
A great deal therefore remains to be done .
. ( FR ) Mr President , this report is vitally important .
We are profoundly affected by the tragedy of trafficking in women which is a modern form of slavery .
Our priority must be to give aid and assistance to the victims .
Women and children are being traded like goods and doomed to prostitution .
They are attracted by promises of employment and some even come in the hope of getting married .
We must help these victims to speak out and denounce their living conditions .
We must welcome and help them .
Some even go as far as committing suicide .
Fighting against trafficking in human beings is essential but it is better to prevent this .
We should not forget that trafficking has economic roots .
We demand a coherent European policy which is why this report is so important .
Mr President , it has already been said .
We are touching upon an important topic here , namely that of people ' s dignity .
Men , girls and boys , are also involved .
It is a growing problem in the EU , too .
Trafficking in women appears to be financially lucrative .
Women are often easy prey , given the poor conditions they live under .
Trafficking in women is increasingly linked with international criminal organisations .
These groups do not always get the recognition they deserve .
The amendment states that NGOs can also include ideologically-based organisations .
Finally , I would like to state that this is an important communication from the Commission .
It is a sound communication and a sound report on which I would like to congratulate Mrs Sörensen .
I hope that the Member States will adopt a dynamic approach in their future dealings with it .
Unfortunately , the institutions ' search for solutions is progressing very slowly , and the problem is growing .
Poverty , social inequality and armed conflict explain migratory flows .
Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Sörensen .
Not only is she proficient , she is also extremely committed to the subject matter .
Trafficking in women has been overlooked for too long , and politicians underestimate its importance .
This actually happened in the Netherlands , not least thanks to the efforts of Secretary of State Verstand .
At the same time , legislation as well as cooperation are inadequate .
The first concerns automatic refugee status for victims of trafficking in women .
We will therefore continue to support this proposal .
Our second objection concerns the reversal of the burden of proof .
This principle is important in a constitutional state .
The concept is taken from administrative law and mainly pertains to discrimination at the workplace .
To incorporate this principle into criminal law would be a huge step .
Finally , the discussion on trafficking in women and people is important and a matter of urgency .
This should not happen .
The problem is urgent and effective measures are required .
Not just words , but deeds are what are needed now .
There are nonetheless two things we do not entirely agree with .
The first concerns the role of the sex industry in this issue .
I would again thank Mrs Sörensen and all our colleagues .
Raising such an issue today might seem anachronistic but slavery will indeed be a part of the 21st century .
Our societies are demanding the right to happiness , pleasure and freedom , and the removal of taboos .
Yet it is actually a denial of freedom .
So much the better , for the resignation shown towards what society has deemed to be irreversible is intolerable .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , simply raising a problem is an admission of its gravity .
Some 500 000 victims of the traffic in human beings arrive each year in Western Europe .
Establishing specific offences at Community level would therefore lead to an impasse .
We shall now proceed to the votes .
Mr President , there was to have been a debate on the question of football violence .
The debate will take place as proposed .
The exact time will be announced later .
Mr President , I am very surprised at the order of voting here .
Mr President , the resolution by the Green Group was tabled first .
Let us proceed with the vote and not reopen the debate .
( Parliament rejected the joint motion for a resolution )
( Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution )
Joint motion for a resolution on falsification of data concerning MOX fuels at Sellafield
( Parliament adopted the joint resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Joint motion for a resolution on the external debt of poor countries
( Parliament adopted the joint resolution )
Joint motion for a resolution on the situation in Zimbabwe
( Parliament adopted the joint resolution )
I say this in relation to the Provan report and the reform of the voting system in Parliament .
I believe this is an unacceptable way to proceed .
As a result , I will not take part in any vote on this report .
I do not want to have a debate on this .
I do not want to dig the rules up .
My own memory of the Rules is that you should do it before votes as well .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
After the adoption of two amendments : Ford , Glyn ( PSE ) .
Mr President , on a point of order .
These two amendments are very similar to those which were rejected in committee .
Could we be clear that the rapporteur is giving the committee 's view and not his own ?
I think that is a matter for you to discuss in your committee .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Mr President , I wanted to make the following suggestion .
This is a tidying-up exercise .
Are there any objections to that oral amendment ?
( Parliament accepted the oral amendment )
Mr Barón Crespo , is this a formal request on behalf of the Socialist Group ?
We can only vote here on things that have really been worked through in committee .
It really is unacceptable to work like this in this Chamber !
This is a report which had to be produced in great haste .
Two committees made substantial input to it .
Maybe it is useful occasionally to look at how we set about things here in Parliament .
This seems a very enjoyable exercise .
I do not want to start another debate .
The Bureau is looking at the working methods of Parliament .
You will all receive a copy of Mr Provan ' s excellent discussion document in the near future .
I therefore request that this be orally amended to " biennial " .
( Parliament accepted the oral amendment )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
That concludes the vote .
That will be the agenda .
Mr President , on a point of order .
Could you explain what the situation is ?
All I can suggest is a belt-and-braces approach .
I accept that it is not a very satisfactory situation .
There must be a chance to do this if another group withdraws its request .
That was the point here !
This is a matter for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs .
Mr President , I did not understand what was to happen with Mrs Sörensen ' s report .
Otherwise , when is it intended that the debate should take place ?
That is correct .
So we will carry on with the debates .
This seems unacceptable to me .
We have agreed to vote at 6 p.m.
Mr Ford , that is not a matter for the President .
The house did that earlier .
That was a decision for the House .
The House is sovereign in these matters .
It was not agreed we would reduce the time of that debate , let us be clear on that .
You are right .
I said an hour .
It was a slip of the tongue .
I believe it is scheduled for an hour and a half .
Again , it will depend on Members ' discipline , something that this House is renowned for .
Mr President , on a point of order .
Could you provide us with information on that ?
What procedures have been put in place ?
Has the air-conditioning system now been switched off ?
Can we therefore assume that an operation has been undertaken to disinfect the system ?
I personally am not in a position to answer any of your questions .
I have no information on this subject .
You will have to refer the matter to the President and to the Quaestors .
I will certainly draw attention to your remarks .
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Ferber report ( A5-0121 / 2000 )
Mr President , I was unable to assent to the Ferber report .
But the European Union will not become more democratic if the European Parliament receives more funding .
Public opinion within Europe requires us to be frugal .
This is why I have voted in favour of Amendment No 2 .
As previous enlargements have shown , it is not viable to wait for this to happen .
Multilingualism is a prerequisite for the smooth running of the European Parliament for three reasons .
Secondly , due to the democratic legitimacy of the European Parliament .
The European Parliament is the democratic representation of the people .
Thirdly , because of the requirement of usefulness .
Multilingualism boosts the efficiency of parliamentary work .
Whichever is adopted , it is clear that linguistic preparation for enlargement should not be postponed any longer .
- ( NL ) Democracy inevitably costs a great deal of money .
We are voting on a Parliament budget to the tune of nearly EUR 1 billion !
We have everything we need in Brussels in terms of facilities .
Secondly , that each MEP has documents in his language at his disposal .
The European Parliament now has three places of work : Brussels , Luxembourg and Strasbourg .
The idea is to keep at most the specialist services such as the printing and translating services in Luxembourg .
This cannot and will not happen .
I have a word of warning for those people who are using these salami tactics against Strasbourg and Brussels .
Katiforis report ( A5-0134 / 2000 )
In my opinion , it is absolutely unacceptable that the elderly continue to be blamed for national budgetary difficulties .
The old government led by the Social Democrats certainly did not bequeath it an easy task .
However , all the commitments in the Stability Pact should now be fully met for the year 2000 .
The Katiforis report is a crude apology for the broad economic policy guidelines of the Member States .
Of its 29 paragraphs , eight start by showing approval and four by being self-congratulatory .
As a result we have voted against the report .
I approved Mr Katiforis ' s approach and arguments in committee .
Like Mr Katiforis , I am delighted to see renewed growth in Europe .
I must firstly congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of his work .
Whether or not the pessimists like this , all the economic lights are on green .
This last point clearly poses the main problem .
The Katiforis report is an incredible demonstration of the lack of awareness among European capitalists .
Despite this convenient denial , the report proposes to plunge further into social regression .
It proposes increased flexibility in the markets , starting with the labour market .
But why should these automatically be allowed to threaten the European social model ?
We have therefore voted against a text which is both foolish and repugnant .
Two points have particularly shaken us .
Can you believe it ?
Since when has growth been rejected in the name of outdated economic dogmas ?
Pomés Ruiz report ( A5-0108 / 2000 )
However , the rapporteur goes even further in supporting the Commission ' s recommendations .
We have accordingly voted against the report .
Goebbels report ( A5-0135 / 2000 )
The derogation of Greece is abrogated with effect from 1 January 2000 " .
I have voted with just as much conviction for the amendments to the Pomés Ruiz report .
Mr President , the vote on Sellafield was a first for the European Parliament .
Randzio-Plath report ( A5-0109 / 2000 )
This is a distortion of competition .
Let us take another sector : state and private pensions .
The report indicates the need for financial transparency between Member States and undertakings .
Resolution on poor countries ' debt
The external debt of the developing countries poses a major challenge .
It imposes far too many conditions on the countries requiring debt relief .
This is why I have abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution .
First of all , we must acknowledge that the Third World debt is illegal .
Resolution on Zimbabwe
The Mugabe regime is authoritarian and corrupt .
Paasilinna report ( A5-0094 / 2000 )
European Union telecommunications directives ought to relate to the European Union .
This undertaking led to the adoption of a series of directives .
However , major problems remain .
The reason for this is clearly the cost of access to these new services .
The preservation of universal service must therefore ensure the inclusive nature of this society .
This measure must be thoroughly discussed with the national authorities in order to respond to the relevant objections .
A major effort must be made in terms of harmonisation and simplification of rules .
We only need to look at Portugal ' s experience in this respect .
We do not think this is the right way to proceed .
We need a modern public telecommunications service which embraces technical and scientific progress .
We also want to see improvements in conditions of employment for the workforce in this sector .
In this context , the report illuminates a number of important aspects .
I therefore abstained from voting on this report .
Alyssandrakis report ( A5-0122 / 2000 )
I offered to teach her , but she refused .
This means that the elderly are not able to benefit from progress .
Alyssandrakis report ( A5-0119 / 2000 )
Mr President , in relation to the second Alyssandrakis report , I must mention my daughter .
That is what they told me when I arrived here this morning . "
I therefore put my name forward to become the first European Union astronaut .
Maybe you should give your mother the spaceship and your daughter the telephone .
The limits on communitarisation imposed by the principle of subsidiarity should therefore be kept in mind .
The logical conclusion is therefore to create a Community patent .
Decision makers at national level will have to be sufficiently far-sighted if this ambitious project is to succeed .
Plooij-Van Gorsel report ( A5-0131 / 2000 )
All this money should be managed by a single expenditure centre : the European Union .
Smet / Gröner report ( A5-0125 / 2000 )
Such an approach ensures that the people concerned have a better understanding of these broad international texts .
We have also discussed and voted on Mrs Sörensen ' s report which deals with trafficking in women .
- The British Conservative Members decided to abstain in our vote on this report .
This should not be construed at all that we are not opposed to discrimination .
We are opposed to discrimination , we do believe in equality of treatment between men and women .
Quite the reverse .
We think quotas of themselves institutionalise discrimination .
For these reasons we voted against certain amendments and abstained on the final vote .
This makes men into hirsute and aggressive beings who are the source of all the world ' s problems .
Clearly , they can contribute to this and we must give them the means to do so .
A restrictive international instrument certainly cannot be based on false assumptions .
The wage gap between men and women of around 30 % still remains .
On this issue , the report should have introduced coercive measures to eliminate this state of affairs .
This would , of course , require a political will .
It is our duty to support them .
That concludes the explanations of vote .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.48 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Meanwhile , coal and steel have ceased being the cornerstones of the integration process .
Europe as a Community of values .
I would now like to move on to the Commission ' s proposal .
The Commissioner has done justice to the wide range of areas across which discrimination can manifest itself .
I hope that this addition can be adopted by the Commission .
Parliament has also looked very carefully into the areas to which this directive applies .
I hope that I have got the wrong end of the stick here .
A much-debated topic in this Parliament is the burden of proof .
This arrangement works well and has caused few problems .
At the same time , I recognise the fact that even more protection is not essential .
Unfortunately , statutory measures against racism are necessary .
They provide victims with protection and a right to redress .
But it is also important in the forming of attitudes .
It makes it clear that Europe will not stand for racism .
It is this message which this Parliament needs to broadcast .
Everyone is different , everyone is equal .
I note what you have said , Mr Ribeiro e Castro .
This is a Parliament with a proud record .
We , too , believe that we have to see a ban on incitement to racism .
Racism is on the rise again .
We all have our local examples .
This has to stop .
Firstly , I want to congratulate the Commission on this text .
It is a good text .
Many of the basic principles we wanted to see are in it .
They want this legislation quickly and they want it now .
That is why it is important that we vote this afternoon .
It is important legislation .
In the context of what has happened in Austria , it becomes even more important .
There are a few things which would add to and strengthen the text .
We need to make sure that these are not just covers for racism .
It is very important that we get it through today .
That is the first point .
The hesitation mainly relates to what should and should not be included in the one report .
It is then up to the party which is indicted to prove that we are wrong .
It is to be welcomed if legislation develops in this respect .
Distribution of the burden of proof will affect their position .
A directive needs to be incorporated into national legislation .
This is , after all , the nature of the directive .
We will not be voting in favour of this , or rather , we will be voting against this .
We must strike up a social dialogue where this type of issue can be discussed .
This is what it is all about .
We are gathered here , people from different nations and of different origins , and we are working together .
I am delighted that this subject is now being discussed in a proper manner .
I am pleased , however , that we managed to stop them in their tracks .
This will not be easy .
The majority of MEPs know very well why this directive is important .
Firstly , it is extremely important for the non-discrimination directive to have a wide and efficient scope .
This is taking it much too far .
We women are already familiar with this procedure .
Equal treatment ( continuation )
I am delighted to have been able to work with Mrs Buitenweg .
This proposed directive is a landmark for Europe .
I want to highlight a few aspects of the text .
Firstly , the very significant inclusion of indirect and institutional racism , and amendments have strengthened that aspect .
Thirdly , the inclusion via Amendments Nos 15 and 29 of disguised race discrimination .
I think that Amendment No 38 is not well drafted .
The definition of a minimum European framework for the fight against discrimination is therefore urgently required .
All these aspects reveal a clear desire to forge ahead .
However , certain shortcomings must be highlighted .
There are also two other problems which I must raise .
The first is of a general nature .
Singling out one type of discrimination gives the impression that some types of discrimination are less reprehensible than others .
This is unacceptable .
A second directive on discrimination at work is to be examined shortly .
Protecting them from just one type will only go part-way towards helping them .
The second problem concerns the exclusion of religious discrimination from this directive .
For example , how do you define the Jewish identity ?
Discrimination against North African communities in Europe is also two-sided .
But first of all , we have to do our work .
How can we claim to be protecting from discrimination those to whom we refuse any citizenship ?
Discrimination will only be effectively combated when governments stop using double talk .
However , this text is a step forward on which we must build .
Unfortunately , it is not evident that that has happened .
On some points , the amendments involve precise improvements to the text in question .
However , in key areas , the amendments that we are debating could potentially wreck everything .
Reversal of the burden of proof is already a very sensitive matter in its own right .
Secondly , there is the issue of nationality .
I myself and my circle of friends have not the faintest idea of our ethnic background .
But it is important not to confuse separate issues .
In other words , ethnicity is one issue and nationality is another .
The other vital area is religion .
We do not believe that the end justifies the means but that the means prefigure the end .
Finally , we do not agree with the references to positive discrimination .
Mr President , it is with mixed feelings that I am making my contribution to this debate .
The change in the burden of proof is just one example of this .
Parliament ' s amendment takes the Commission ' s proposal one step further .
The Commission specifies that the principle of subsidiarity is still being enforced , but I question that .
The directive is said to have a supplementary function with regard to the political signal it sends out .
There is no place for discrimination on these grounds in a modern society .
However , it is possible to overshoot the mark , even in the case of such an uncontroversial issue .
Arrangements like this do not result in greater understanding for the victims of discrimination .
Quite the opposite - it actually harms the cause .
Twenty years on , it is now coming true .
We are here discussing this directive .
I should like to comment on a number of amendments .
I think , therefore , that we can use this experience and be bold enough to take this approach .
We understand the argument that it is often difficult to make a clear distinction .
I should like to refer very briefly to the more basic amendments which we are unable to accept .
It is with pleasure that I compliment Mrs Buitenweg on her report .
I have another four points I would like to make , Mr President .
This would be a gain , in my view .
All the more reason to accept a swift implementation here .
And on time !
MEPs and NGOs worked very hard to get Article 13 into the Treaty .
I look forward to seeing further directives , perhaps starting with disability .
Initially , I was against racism being taken separately .
I would have liked to see it taken with the directive on employment and with the Action Programme .
I was persuaded of the urgency , because of the current rise of racism across the EU .
A number of Members have cited individual cases today .
We have to send the message that we are opposed to racism and xenophobia across the EU .
I am glad for that reason that we are having the vote today .
May I turn specifically to some of the amendments .
I am very well aware that some European jargon excludes people .
This is the reason I wanted Amendment No 48 on simple language to go in .
Amendment No 43 : people have talked already about the burden of proof .
This is working towards a shared burden of proof .
They are at the sharp end ; they know what they are talking about .
It is very pleasing to see this .
There was no anti-discrimination provision of this kind in the treaties before .
The European Parliament has also made its own contribution .
In general , Mrs Buitenweg ' s 55 or so amendments make the Commission proposal much more substantial .
She has achieved a great deal .
The proposal before us is the first implementation of Article 13 .
It concerns equal treatment irrespective of the colour of people ' s skin or their ethnic origin .
The Commission is also attempting to build on experience gained in the Member States .
The reversal of the burden of proof will make the directive a very important instrument .
The defendant will now have to provide convincing proof that there is no discrimination .
Nevertheless , a very important step is being taken today and we are giving a signal .
Mr President , I too congratulate Mrs Buitenweg on her excellent work .
This discrimination encourages them to withdraw into their identities and further reinforces their marginalisation .
For all these reasons we must vote for this report .
Yet discriminatory practices are continuing .
Most of the time complaints are filed without being followed up by the police .
Ensuring equal rights is a state responsibility .
The associations are currently leading the fight against discrimination .
Finally , another problem still remains which is the differing application of the nationality code .
That apart , I congratulate Mrs Buitenweg and warmly welcome this report .
Yes , I asked Mr Sylla to slow down .
But he is free to accept or reject my advice .
Mr President , I wish to make three points .
It has been a long time coming .
I suppose in a way it was worth waiting .
The last of these must be workable , because otherwise we will keep the previous speaker happy !
Thirdly and finally , I wish to warn my colleagues in the PPE Group .
Yet a few clearly have darker motives .
Those who lie down with dogs get fleas .
We are used to coming out against racism , because we want to combat intolerance and xenophobia .
Perhaps we must also combat these things for the sake of our own future .
I support most of the amendments , but on one point I am uneasy .
I am afraid that this may be self-defeating .
The general interpretation is , in fact , that ethnic affiliation embraces nationality .
I shall not , therefore , be voting for the present amendment .
It contradicts what I properly consider to be the case .
I welcome the directive .
I am pleased Council feels a sense of urgency about it .
I assume this will be reflected in their willingness to take on board what Parliament is saying .
We have to demand the highest standards of ourselves .
It will not be easy to implement this directive and I am not referring to the votes .
That will not be easy or painless .
That cannot be done unless the individuals within them examine their own beliefs and actions .
We should also all be concerned about integration , about good neighbourliness .
We should endeavour to provide incentives and to act as a model .
I believe that in human society acting as a model is a particularly important characteristic .
We are therefore the European country that has accepted most refugees per inhabitant .
We were a kind of life-raft in Europe , and we still are today .
We fight against extremism on both the left and the right , as well as against violence .
Austria has the world ' s strictest laws against fascism and against nazism .
We have learnt some lessons from history and we know how to fight these things .
We are now talking about discrimination .
First and foremost , I am speaking on behalf of small- and medium-sized enterprises .
Form filling is , of course , a very inefficient kind of work .
It will encourage abuse .
People will need to protect themselves against such abuse .
It will be necessary to keep more evidence .
I can see great dangers here and we must ensure that they are averted .
This House should recognise and change its tone on what it sees as Article 13 .
Posturing is easy .
Motivations are many and varied .
My friend , Mr Sylla , and I are concerned about two important things .
One is that we create a level playing field through Article 13 .
We have some - we can improve ours .
I would also congratulate the rapporteur on a splendid piece of work .
I would especially emphasise four factors which I think are particularly interesting about this directive .
At the same time , a shared burden of proof has been proposed .
The time is right to do so .
We are more than a trading block .
I hope that this approach will be addressed when we look at the situation effecting all minorities .
The price if we do not is a Europe falling far short of its true potential .
That is why this directive and the Article 13 package , as a whole , are so significant .
It is not perfect .
These current steps must be applauded but there is still a long way to go .
( Applause ) .
We should , therefore , adopt this report without further delay .
If anything , these so-called more recent factors deserve more , not less , attention .
It was probably for fear of stating the obvious that no such mention was made .
Mr President , we are all opposed to discrimination and violence of all forms .
New laws will not change the hearts and minds of the people of Europe .
This is a very dangerous precedent against all forms of natural justice .
Of course , we all condemn violent racist crimes and attacks .
Criminal justice must remain the prerogative of the Member States .
This must remain the prerogative of the Member States who will retain control of their own justice systems .
The EU has no competence in this area whatsoever .
I call on all those with any sense to oppose these measures .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place immediately following the urgencies .
Topical and urgent debate
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
The first item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0432 / 2000 by Van den Bos , Malmström and Thors , on behalf of the ELDR Group ;
B5-0448 / 2000 by Sauquillo Pérez del Arco and Schori , on behalf of the PSE Group ;
B5-0456 / 2000 by Van Hecke , Ferrer , Schwaiger and Maij-Weggen , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group ;
B5-0465 / 2000 by Morgantini , Sjöstedt , Brie and Manisco , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group
on the situation in Sierra Leone .
Mr President , let us exercise honesty rather than hypocrisy .
We are not prepared to make any sacrifices .
The United States is paralysed by the Somalia syndrome .
The Union hides behind Washington ' s back .
The United Nations ' intervention has once again turned into a fiasco .
More than anything , we now need a watertight diamond boycott .
I would call for at least exercising more honesty when we discuss Africa .
Murder , mutilation , abduction and rape simply continued as before .
Mr President , we are appalled at the present situation in Sierra Leone .
We demand an end to this military escalation and the immediate resumption of negotiations .
One-sided recriminations are neither appropriate nor helpful in this situation .
Quite the contrary , it brings with it the risk of uncontrollable escalation .
It is high time that the causes of this situation were addressed and a political solution was found .
However , our commitment must not end with this call .
We must also eradicate the cancer which has given rise to the destabilisation of that country .
We are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Schuman declaration .
This is exactly the rapid reaction we are asking for within the European Union .
We should consider that lesson when we try to impose peace agreements in the future .
However , the Sierra Leone army and its militias should also come in for criticism .
We are right to condemn the use of diamonds by the RUF for war purposes .
But what are the economic interests behind the government ' s actions ?
But who is selling arms to these countries and who is buying the diamonds ?
We understand that has already commenced , but there is a long way to go .
That , if anything , is an understatement .
In addition , this funding has covered support to amputees - the all too many amputees in the country .
Ex-combatant children will again receive psychosocial support .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken at 6 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0433 / 2000 by Van den Bos , on behalf of the ELDR Group ;
B5-0449 / 2000 by Titley and Sakellariou , on behalf of the PSE Group ;
B5-0457 / 2000 by Van Orden and Deva , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group ;
B5-0466 / 2000 by Frahm , Morgantini and Manisco , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group ;
B5-0474 / 2000 by Lambert , McKenna and Lagendijk , on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group
on Sri Lanka .
The resolution sends out a powerful message .
The fighting has to stop .
The parties have to get round the table and reach a reasonable solution that will last .
We must all recognise the overriding importance of maintaining the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka .
Beyond that there are many political options that can fruitfully be pursued .
Above all , Parliament ' s resolution is unequivocal in its condemnation of terrorism .
This is a scourge which affects us all .
This situation must change .
I commend the resolution on Sri Lanka to this House .
In this conflict , far too many people have died .
It is clear that thousands of people have been displaced within Sri Lanka .
The resolution is clear .
Those laws must be lifted before the elections in August .
Something has to change .
We have to do what we can to work for a peaceful and lasting settlement .
Northern Ireland is a clear example of the difficulties of such a process , but also the possibilities .
There are four million Tamils in Sri Lanka and there are 15 million Sinhalese .
The resolution states how many people he has killed .
The LTTE has to be stopped .
Mr President , here we are again witnessing a conflict between two diametrically opposed parties .
At this point , a choice must be made between the two solutions .
One of the Members referred to the case of the State of Singapore .
Singapore used to be part of Malaysia but it is now an independent State .
I know Sri Lanka , I have been there .
I can give you examples of what I have seen .
I have seen Tamil men being harassed on the streets by government troops .
That goes back longer than last May .
The Commission shares the concerns of the European Parliament regarding the latest developments in and around Jaffna .
That is fairly clear and understandable .
The European Commission will continue to provide emergency humanitarian aid to populations affected by the conflict .
I last visited Sri Lanka in the late 1980s .
Alas , 12 , 13 years later , the violence continues .
That is a reminder of what has been missed in Sri Lanka as a result of this violence .
We all hope that it ends very soon .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken at 6 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0434 / 2000 by Haarder , on behalf of the ELDR Group ;
B5-0442 / 2000 by Collins and Ribeiro e Castro , on behalf of the UEN Group ;
B5-0454 / 2000 by Schori , Sakellariou and Linkohr , on behalf of the PSE Group ;
B5-0458 / 2000 by Posselt , on behalf of the PPE ­ DE Group ;
B5-0473 / 2000 by Isler-Béguin , Kreissl-Dörfler , Wuori and McKenna , on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group
on the Philippines .
B5-0435 / 2000 by Gasòliba i Böhm and Sánchez García , on behalf of the ELDR Group ;
B5-0459 / 2000 by Ferrer , on behalf of the PPE ­ DE Group ;
B5-0468 / 2000 by Marset Campos and Cossutta , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group ;
on Equatorial Guinea .
Iran ( press code )
B5-0436 / 2000 by Malmström and Ries , on behalf of the ELDR Group ;
B5-0440 / 2000 by Belder and Van Dam , on behalf of the EDD Group ;
B5-0447 / 2000 by Rühle , Boumediène-Thiery and Cohn-Bendit , on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group ;
B5-0450 / 2000 by Schori and Sakellariou , on behalf of the PSE Group ;
B5-0460 / 2000 by Posselt , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group ;

B5-0451 / 2000 by Schori , Sakellariou and Veltroni , on behalf of the PSE Group ;
B5-0461 / 2000 by Maij-Weggen , on behalf of the PPE ­ DE Group ;
B5-0470 / 2000 by Vinci , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group
on Burma .
on the right to safety at Euro 2000
Mr President , Commissioner , the crisis in the Philippines we are discussing is a tragedy .
I represent one of the countries which has citizens as hostages there .
There is , nonetheless , something to be learned from all tragic events .
To that extent , we are responsible for many of the conflicts in this region .
We should not put ourselves on a pedestal .
We have to recognise that we bear a lot of the responsibility for these developments .
We also know that the violence has its roots in poverty .
Without the political will to end the situation , the violence can only continue .
Secondly , the population endures harsh conditions of poverty .
We are therefore concerned and we ask that efforts be made to observe how the elections are carried out .
Guinea is sinking further and further into under-development .
We therefore believe that this House should follow that line .
This is the only way that freedom may be fully restored to the people of Guinea .
Iran ( press code )
The struggle in Iran for reform and freedom is of great interest .
They are targeting the independent press because it is a major channel for reformists .
This course probably coincides rather well with the pursuit of a civil society .
This was underlined by a painful defeat in the parliamentary elections only a few months ago .
This hit the ultra-conservatives during the parliamentary elections particularly hard .
The latter knew and know that they can count on the support of the large majority of the population .
The reform process in Iran is at risk .
We are also concerned about the ban on all pro-reform newspapers and magazines published in Iran .
Mr President , we are currently witnessing massive attacks on the freedom of the press .
Yesterday , the same thing happened in Belgrade to the independent radio station there .
We must not leave the opposition unsupported by adopting measures that encourage isolation .
Awkward because the Burmese junta was successful in obtaining international recognition .
I refer , naturally , to Burma joining the ASEAN .
These relations are too important for this .
However , we have to ascertain at the same time that our own sanctions were not that effective either .
It may be opportune to consider whether we can take so-called intelligent sanctions against Burma .
After all , sanctions should just focus on the one goal , namely the reinstatement of democracy in Burma .
We also need to criticise the French government for the fact that they are backing this .
Even the British government is more progressive when it comes to their policy on this .
The British government has actually called on Premier Oil to withdraw from Burma .
The French government should follow the example of the British government .
Mr President , it is now ten years since Burma witnessed a political drama .
In the parliamentary elections , the NLD won most of the parliamentary seats .
Shortly after this , the military once again seized power .
Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi was imprisoned .
Since then , Burma has been the scene of unprecedented repression .
There is talk of forced labour .
Burma can be compared with South Africa and Chile in the Eighties .
What action would we like the Commission and Council to take ?
This is the core of our request .
If it does , then we are using double standards .
Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi should at long last receive an effective response to her peaceful protest .
Football : " Euro 2000 " and preventing hooliganism
Most Members will find this motion uncontentious .
These I will tackle now because I believe these points are what people want to hear about .
This stand , like all the others , will be full to capacity on 17 June .
Most people are looking forward to a good match and hope that it will be safe .
But , unfortunately , that is not the view of everybody .
There is a group of people who very definitely are planning to be there .
The head of the Belgian Police Federation has said that he is concerned .
I do not believe , however , that the motion before us deals with the problem correctly .
This is wrong for several reasons .
Our fellow Member has spoken of regional pride .
It is therefore completely wrong to talk of regional rivalries .
Are we going to deal tomorrow or next week with the trains leaving Paddington Station ?
Mr President , there are a number of advantages to this text .
Despite that , is there still a risk ?
Of course , but then there is always a risk .
Paragraph 2 , as indicated by Mr Dehousse , is incorrect .
The Belgian authorities have given authorisation for the Charleroi stadium to be used .
Paragraph 3 , which indicates that the King Baudouin stadium in Brussels might be used , is wrong .
No authority and no official has indicated this .
He said that it is a suitable stadium for a high-level match .
So , be sporting !
Mr President , we must take these issues of hooliganism seriously .
We must try to counter this phenomenon of hooliganism to the best of our ability .
The motion is good in that it indicates that adequate safety measures must be taken .
In this respect I believe there to have been a recent example in France which is very important .
The content of the current resolution overlooks the causes of hooliganism , whether or not consciously .
It is clear that the initiators of the resolution are more concerned with slating the organisation of Euro 2000 .
The Liberals , however , refuse to play this game .
Mr President , we are unable to support the submitted resolution .
How can we better educate club managers and organisers of games ?
It will be different at Euro 2000 , as this will be a football party for everyone .
We strongly condemn such terrorist actions .
We are following events in Mindanao and the neighbouring islands closely .
Obviously , we all hope for their early release .
Our thoughts are , I am sure , with their families .
I hope that their whereabouts will soon be discovered .
Moving on to Equatorial Guinea .
We have been closely monitoring the human rights situation there for several years .
We share the concerns of the European Parliament about the local elections there .
Those concerns were reflected in the presidency declaration at the beginning of May .
An answer containing detailed reasons for the refusal is being sent by the Commission to President Obiang .
However , we intend to involve ourselves in promoting the process of democratisation in Equatorial Guinea .
The Iranian authorities are well aware of the importance we attach to these issues .
The current trial of the 13 Jews on charges of espionage is also very disturbing .
I turn to Burma .
We deplore the continued violation of human rights by the Burmese military regime .
I just wish to make two additional points .
I would just like to add one point .
I very much hope that Euro 2000 is a great success .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken at 6 p.m.
Mr President , on a point of order .
I know a number of Members during the week have been unable to get any food .
Could we have some clarification from the Quaestors so that we can have a Members bar ?
We have a Members bar in Brussels .
I hope we can have some clarification .
Thank you , Mr Sturdy .
We will refer that to the College of Quaestors , as you requested .
The matter of football hooliganism was under the human rights matters .
That debate has been concluded .
So we have finished that whole section .
I do not want lots of debates .
We have a lot of voting to get through tonight .
If that had been the case , some Members might have voted differently .
We were going to discuss Guatemala .
That was the rule under which this practice has been established .
I agree with you that it should not become a precedent .
Let us move forward now to the vote .
Mr President , on a point of order .
I should like to move that we proceed to a vote straight away .
Mr President , people are different , yet of equal value .
Everyone is entitled to this .
There is also discrimination if the basic requirements of people are made unnecessarily scarce .
And this is just the Commission ' s text which is the most moderate .
The European Parliament report adds to this in all respects .
This unusual procedure clearly shows that the issue is not cut and dried .
This is why I abstained during the vote on the legislative resolution .
- I am voting in favour of the Race Directive for the following reasons .
The attack on the white partner of the world-class black athlete Ashia Hansen is a sickening example .
Right-wing extremism is increasing , not just in Austria , but throughout Europe .
Minority groups must be given a greater stake in Europe .
The EU should pay more attention to their problems and aspirations .
We need to connect EU institutions to all the communities of the Union .
Europe must be inclusive , not exclusive .
We must tackle racism wherever and whenever it occurs .
The race directive is a stand against racism and a major step towards stamping it out .
According to Article 13 of the Treaty , the European Parliament is merely to be heard on this matter .
These matters continue to be national concerns .
But what about all the other protective considerations listed in Article 13 of the Treaty ?
However , such initiatives are no longer enough .
We must go further and legislate .
Is this the right moment to reiterate our vigilance with regard to certain parties now in power ?
We should like an assurance that this will be duly corrected .
We must lead the way in this fight .
That concludes the vote .
Trafficking in women ( continuation )
The next item is the continuation of the debate on trafficking in women .
The trade in sex is increasing at an alarming rate .
Women and children are involved .
Few offenders are brought to court , and still fewer prosecuted .
A growing number of women are being smuggled in from the candidate States .
This report is very good .
Mr President , prevention is better than cure .
This seems to be an impossible task in the case of trafficking in women .
We cannot bridge this chasm between rich and poor with a few initiatives organised at Community level .
Only in this way can trafficking in women be effectively pushed back .
I would like to thank the rapporteur for her very valuable report .
The body and the human person are not commodities .
I would like to stress three points : firstly , trafficking and immigration .
The Member States must develop a more united , responsible policy .
Thirdly : the victims ' rights .
I would like to finish by raising the question of clients .
But who are the clients ?
They could be our fathers , our sons or ourselves .
This means promoting policies which support women .
May I extend my congratulations to the honourable Member , Mrs Sörensen .
Her report is a very valuable contribution towards continuing our work .
We have proved that in the proposals that we put to the European Council of Tampere last October .
I will therefore try to address a few of these key issues .
This was one of the Commission ' s suggestions in its second communication .
This element must , however , be seen as a crucial complement to the first set of initiatives .
As a matter of fact , there is a real difficulty in convicting those who are responsible for trafficking .
The proposal will , of course , build on experience gained from the first programme .
I want to thank Mrs Sörensen for her knowledge , her expertise and her contribution to this common fight .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 a.m.
Readmission of third country nationals
This is a sensitive issue which calls for diplomatic collaboration .
The initiative does not show any strategic vision .
We only differed on a formal detail .
I am certain that it was very well intended , but it has not been thought through sufficiently .
Legally speaking , it has thrown up more questions than it has supplied explanations .
I would like to add a few important points .
This is bordering on blackmail .
My view of the Finnish initiative is much less critical than theirs .
Apart from that , I agree with many of the criticisms that have been made .
I also agree with one which has been made implicitly but which has not been stated directly .
What we need now , given the developments since Tampere , is a more global vision .
All these types of bilateral agreement that are required are being negotiated .
Mr President , I would first like to thank the rapporteur and the draftsperson for their report and opinion .
We have heard about these shortcomings in the debate as well as reading about them in the reports .
I regret that the Council ' s and Parliament ' s time has been used in this way .
This idea is interesting for three reasons .
This reasoning is , of course , diametrically opposed to ours .
Mr President , the Commission would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 a.m.
( The sitting was closed at 7.50 p.m. )
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
This will obviously be corrected .
Unfortunately , we will then have to wait for the result of these checks .
I am not prepared to die from legionnaire 's disease because I have to sit in Strasbourg in June .
Therefore we should do something about it now and not just talk about it .
Firstly , could the same checks be carried out for Parliament in Brussels ?
Madam President , thank you for giving me the floor .
This check has therefore been carried out and , as you know , it proved negative on two points .
We are quite certain that asbestos was not used to construct the building .
There is therefore no cause for alarm at present .
In this way , the two half truths could be turned into two complete truths .
If they appear to be necessary , the changes will indeed be made .
I asked for an air quality check in January .
Why has it taken so long to get that air quality check ?
Are there any other comments on the Minutes ?
There are no further comments .
( The Minutes were approved )
During yesterday ' s vote on the Buitenweg report , we witnessed some very serious goings-on in this Parliament .
That is all I wished to say .
I should like the position of this House to be made very clear .
I appealed to the House to act fairly .
I would urge the Members dealing with this matter to declare a moratorium .
We are about to take up the matter of enhancing the status of Fridays .
However , I believe Mrs Buitenweg cannot attend today ' s sitting .
In any event , we must nevertheless enhance the status of Fridays .
Our Group is in the process of taking appropriate precautionary action .
I would urge you to let us work fairly and to stop deliberately disrupting our work .
He has not been given any information , which explains why he has made this request now .
I think it is odd , to say the least , that our colleagues should behave in this way .
It is an extremely serious document which Mrs Sörensen has written and which we shall be voting on today .
Madam President , I just wanted to correct what Mr Posselt said .
He said that he did not think there was a quorum on the vote on Mrs Buitenweg 's report .
The same thing will happen today with the fight against trafficking in women .
Mr Duff , do you uphold your request ?
We shall then see if 32 Members join you .
What I will do is to press my point of order .
Very well , so are there 32 Members to support this request ?
( 24 Members rose ) The request is therefore withdrawn .
The Commission proposes that the initiative be rejected .
Madam President , I think you are mistaken as the voting list is different .
If we want to reject Finland ' s initiative , we must vote against it .
That is primarily what we are voting on .
I would therefore urge you to allow me to very briefly explain the process once again .
I would urge that this rather remarkable procedure be carried out .
It gives us the chance to obtain a new text .
Indeed , it is quite complicated .
Before the start of the vote
( 19 Members rose )
The request is withdrawn .
Relating to Amendment No 10
Madam President , with regard to this amendment , there is a linguistic problem .
As you know , Madam President , this does not have the same meaning in French .
The amendment seeks to correct this .
I wanted to point this out .
Relating to Amendment No 5
I endorse this amendment .
If not , I should like us to return to the original wording .
You , Madam President , said one thing and Mrs Sörensen another .
Would you be so kind as to repeat what the oral amendment should really consist of ?
I apologise for the lack of clarity .
Madam President , it was with great pleasure that I voted for the Sörensen report .
Out of the 7 213 words in this report , a mere handful are dedicated to the truth .
It is essential that an ambitious development aid policy is implemented beforehand .
They will be called upon to play an even more important role in the immediate future .
NAFO has served as a model in many cases .
To be quite frank , the owners of these vessels are stealing fish .
They deliberately refuse to join NAFO , of which the European Union is a member .
They think they can shirk all their responsibilities by doing so .
This concerns everyone : the international community , individual countries and the European Union .
A final word on this interesting term ' international law ' .
EU law also has its origins in international law .
I would very much like to support this report .
They can flout the law and no one is going to try and enforce it .
This really has to stop .
ICAT really does mean business and other people should follow suit .
Organisations like ICAT and NAFO cannot solve the problem on their own .
The responsibility lies in many other quarters and this responsibility needs to be taken seriously .
There is no way of enforcing the law .
This is why it is so popular .
The EU is among the worst in this sense .
Each country tends to have their preferred flag use .
For instance , the French vessels tend to use flags of Réunion , St Vincent and the Seychelles .
For Greece it is Cyprus and Panama .
The preferred British countries are Panama and Belize .
The Council refused .
At least one organisation is trying to draw this matter to the public 's attention .
The European Union has to take responsibility on this issue .
It does not exercise the public mind an awful lot in the European Union .
We are the biggest market and the most lucrative market in the world for fish products .
Stocks within our limit can be affected by activities outside it .
There would be widespread public support for some sort of system that requires compensation .
In respect of the proposed amendments , I should stress the following .
Amendment No 1 does not seem to be necessary .
Amendment No 2 is relevant and will be taken on board .
Amendment No 3 is not acceptable to the Commission .
There is no need to impose an obligation on individual vessels .
If it merely involves spelling out a faculty for individual vessels , there is no need to regulate .
The debate is closed .
The debate is closed .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution ) EXPLANATION OF VOTE
We will be staffing ships with sailors who do not know how to swim , next .
Protection of juveniles of marine organisms
As a result , alongside the Commission , we are aiming and endeavouring to protect fishery resources .
The Commission ' s proposed revisions and additions to Annex XII appear to be reasonable .
This compromise , of course , has already been agreed with the Member States as being more appropriate .
We are therefore always prepared to take the necessary measures to protect them .
The regulation which we are dealing with is not a new one .
In fact , it is being amended again today for the fifth time .
In the end it is the theoretical expert who must give way to practice .
They represent the latest technical and scientific developments .
Ultimately , Parliament has no interest in branding the Commission as its general scapegoat .
This cooperation is imperative for the preservation of sea populations .
Who , apart from the Commission , should monitor them and protect this natural resource ?
Quantity instead of quality ?
These measures are a step in the right direction .
Ladies and gentleman , this is a matter of 2 millimetres of carpetshell .
It would take a long and complicated explanation to say why .
But for a regulation to fulfil its purpose , it must be adapted to real conditions .
But , if need be , we will be here to amend it once again .
The low breeding rate of the kittiwake that Mr Busk referred to is of particular concern .
Surely we must question the effectiveness of MAGPs as a conservation measure .
The Commission also failed to take into account how fleet sizes are reduced .
I call for a more thorough investigation by the Commission into this .
How many would be decommissioned ?
How many were scrapped ?
How many were sunk and so on ?
How many were simply transferred to another flag ?
In Scotland , the proposed cuts would cost hundreds of jobs in particularly fragile rural areas .
It is on the last proposal that I primarily wish to speak .
It is important for the conservation of sea birds .
It is important for us to demonstrate our concern in this area .
Mr President , this is an important subject .
It is highly technical and not easily understood by the public .
We can improve our resources .
This is highly technical .
There is a great urge to go out and catch more and more of it .
People complain about the Multi-Annual Guidance Programme and say it is not working .
The same applies to trains or trucks .
Surely it contributes more to regional and national economic planning to do that .
There is no need for it .
We have one programme broadcast in Ireland that deals with the sea .
It is called " Seascapes " .
Mr McCartin appeared with his last remarks to be accusing honourable Members of this House of misleading the public .
I hope that was not true .
Mr McCartin is far too polite to make any such accusation .
That concludes the debate .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution ) EXPLANATION OF VOTE
Mr President , as representative of the Pensioners ' Party I voted for the Varela report .
I would like to thank the House for its patience in listening to my explanations of votes .
You are right , the Members Bar is only for the use of Members .
We will ensure that is enforced .
This matter has already been drawn to the attention of the Quaestors .
Since I am often here on Fridays anyway , I personally do not find this at all difficult .
The subject is exemption regulations , which are in force for the European insurance industry .
This serves consumers , promotes technical progress , and prevents monopolies and agreements .
Therefore , the rules on this are strict .
We will deal with the first of these areas today .
The general prohibition of cartel agreements is lifted under certain conditions ; these are the exemption regulations .
A regulation of this kind has existed in the field of insurance since 1992 , and expires in 2003 .
Whether this is correct or not is doubtful .
This concerns matters which are connected with the possibility of termination .
With this in mind , I would urge you to give your assent . Thank you very much .
A brief word of background about the regulation in question is perhaps in order .
Most of these notifications concerned insurance pools .
The current regulation expires on 31 March 2003 and a new regulation will be necessary .
The future regulation should build on these strengths and remedy any weaknesses in the existing one .
It does not , however , contain precise proposals for the future regulation .
These will only be decided upon after the end of the consultation process .
Considerable account will be taken of Parliament 's resolution in this process .
Other interested parties , including professional insurance bodies and consumer organisations , will also be consulted .
That concludes the debate .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
( Parliament adopted the resolution ) EXPLANATION OF VOTE
I would like for this to be the case in other areas as well .
One of my groups of visitors found this out again on their way here this morning .
This particular company has transported thousands of my visitors here in the past ten years .
What is going on here then ?
I must say that these visitors wonder , naturally , whether this is what Europe is all about .
Moreover , the French police do not seem to have heard of credit cards yet .
The visitors had to pool their French francs together to pay the horrendous FRF 5 000 fine .
This cannot be right , Mr President !
I will , of course , check ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
I am afraid I must cut you off , Mrs Lulling .
Explanations of vote must refer to the subject of the debate .
There you have it . Insurance companies consider that the elderly are worthless .
But I say that the elderly are worth more .
I therefore call for measures to be included in the regulation that will put a stop to this injustice .
Mr President , I just wanted to ask one question .
I will take that as an interesting intervention .
Adjournment of the session
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament .
( The sitting closed at 11.30 a.m. )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday , 19 May 2000 .
She was Co-President of the Group of the Greens between 1990 and 1994 .
Mrs Adelaide Aglietta was a very courageous woman .
( The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence )
Statement by the President
( The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence )
We should like to show our solidarity with the family and friends of the deceased .
Once again political confrontation shows its most dreadful aspect .
The leaders of Sinn Fein have never condemned the IRA 's violence .
On the other hand , I believe that the words of the MEP from Euskal Herritarrok are a disgrace .
The MEP in question has no right to class himself alongside Mandela .
Nelson Mandela deserves a different kind of respect .
The legitimate interests of the Basque people are represented by the people who have been democratically elected .
Madam President , you will be very welcome in the Basque Country .
Madam President , I would like to thank you for your words of condemnation and condolence .
We have constantly rejected the use of violence in order to achieve political objectives .
We cannot deny that a terrorist phenomenon has been a thorn in Greece ' s side for many years .
Madam President , we are indebted to Mr Leinen for reminding us about this incident .
Incidentally , we should refrain from entering into debate on this issue at present .
It now looks as if we will need to be financially reimbursed for cancelling a working day .
Mr Meijer , I think that you have not got the information quite right .
We too have now been successful in obtaining television in our own language here in Strasbourg .
I just want to say , ' Mary , you are fantastic .
Thank you , Mr Blak .
We shall pass your satisfaction and thanks on to Mrs Banotti .
Madam President , on a point of order .
I will ensure that Mrs Banotti gets that information .
I will also be pressuring her to have Irish television here too .
Let us hope that we are on the road to something extremely successful in the north of Ireland .
Madam President , just now you had to announce some extremely sad news .
It ought to be read and discussed among the Members before it is signed .
It is a humiliating situation when students are sent documents to which we ourselves do not have access .
I have just one more sentence ....
( The President cut the speaker off )
You have made a mistake in this case .
The groups will naturally have adequate time to examine this document .
The travel document which I used was the pass issued to all MEPs by the European Parliament .
Thank you . I shall take note of your comments .
We shall look into what we can do to proceed as you suggest .
The report in question is the report on the war in Kosovo .
This is not acceptable .
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the sitting of Friday , 19 May have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
That is all I wished to say .
I should like the position of this House to be made very clear " .
Thank you , Mr Medina Ortega .
We shall check all this and correct the Minutes , if necessary .
Are there any other comments on the Minutes ?
There are no further comments .
( The Minutes were approved )
Who wishes to speak to propose this ?
Madam President , naturally we are very concerned about the situation in Kosovo .
You will understand that we are keen to keep this text .
We have always stressed prevention .
I urge the honourable members to support this motion for a resolution .
We can only do this using the modest means at our disposal , namely a motion for a resolution .
We are not here to start a debate .
We followed the efforts undertaken by yourself and by Mrs Kinnock , and we supported you in your endeavours .
Let me make that point .
( Parliament rejected the proposal )
Still on the subject of the topical and urgent debate , I have received another request on Venezuela .
Madam President , there are two reasons as to why we are not debating the Venezuela issue .
Firstly , there is the respect we have for our own Rules of Procedure .
( Parliament approved the proposal )
( The order of business was adopted thus amended )
In short , no such inquiry is possible .
Article 193 of the Treaty clearly specifies that , potentially , this is Parliament ' s responsibility .
I wish to look into the matter in depth rather than adopt a position in haste .
Nonetheless , I wish at this stage to reserve judgement on the admissibility of this amendment .
According to the Rules of Procedure , that is a different option to the committee of inquiry .
I requested a report from the Legal Service which was received a week ago .
The issue was included in the agenda of last week ' s Conference of Presidents .
Since the priority was to deal with other issues , it could not be discussed .
There is an obvious gap in the Rules of Procedure in this respect .
I think the House must decide .
Mr Lannoye , I have taken note of your comments , and those of Mr Barón Crespo .
Request for the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Brie
The Legal Affairs Committee recommends to the House that we decide not to waive immunity in this case .
It would be helpful if I say a few brief words about the grounds for our recommendations .
This was repeated on other occasions .
Our recommendation is that we should not waive immunity .
This is a case of the conduct of political activity and the expression of political opinion .
The tenor of decisions of Parliament in such cases has always been that immunity is not waived .
This is not a matter of a benefit conferred on individual Members as politicians .
I have great pleasure in proposing to the House the report of the Legal Affairs Committee .
As Mr MacCormick has pointed out , there have been cases where Parliament has decided to waive immunity .
As long as these rules exist , however , they must apply equally to everyone .
This case is concerned only with a purely administrative violation .
I understand that the same view has been expressed by members of different parties in Germany .
I therefore think that the matter is quite clear .
Request for the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Kronberger
The situation in the case of Mr Kronberger is completely different from the last situation we dealt with .
In this case we are dealing with a mere traffic offence , which has nothing to do with politics .
There is no political element , no element of fumus persecutionis .
Mr Kronberger himself accepts the waiver of his immunity and has no objection whatsoever .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Manufacture , presentation and sale of tobacco products
Tobacco is a natural stimulant .
You are supposed to enjoy it and politicians should not spoil this enjoyment .
But , Mr President , this is not how it is of course .
Needless to say , the element of freedom of choice and personal responsibility should be retained .
This is our business .
And rightly so !
I , however , do not share this doubt at all .
If it had been a public health directive , then other measures would have been proposed .
Harmonisation , therefore , will benefit industry and public health .
We want to provide consumers with free choice based on more extensive information .
The best means of communication is the packet itself .
First and foremost , the information is misleading .
This terminology should be withdrawn .
They know that smoking is not good for you but they know precious little else .
The message on the packet should take up more space and should ideally be illustrated .
How much space , you may ask ?
Well , enough space .
This is bound to result in better policy .
Similarly , the dialogue with the health organisations and industry has been a positive step .
A choice between tinkering at the edges or taking forceful measures .
Mr President , smoking is bad for the health .
It is , however , naive to assume that we will manage to banish smoking altogether .
Secondly , I would like to touch upon health .
People should , however , be able to gain easy and free access to product information .
It is also important to point out the dangers of passive smoking .
With regard to subsidies , I am in favour of phasing these out .
This is why I am in favour of scrapping the ban on snuff .
Concerning warnings , the rules of the importing countries could prevail .
The product concerned is also more expensive .
Hence the distinction drawn .
And that is what counts .
This is not , however , the case .
This is not the future we want for our own children .
Let us also give a thought to other people ' s future .
Several contentious issues still remain .
The labelling of tobacco products other than cigarettes must be subject to the same conditions .
Tar content must be limited still further .
The problem has been raised , albeit indirectly , of reducing and abolishing production aids for tobacco .
And it will upset them retroactively .
What sort of law school did the people who approve such arbitrary reversals attend ?
I should be most interested to hear the Commission ' s comments on this .
Multinationals are already doing just that .
Calendar of part-sessions for 2001
Manufacture , presentation and sale of tobacco products ( continuation )
The matter has been referred to the Court of Justice of the European Communities .
Whatever the case , we are required to examine the content of the report before us .
Of course , many more people die too .
On the basis of these facts , then , some sensible proposals have been made .
These are intelligent and reasonable suggestions .
This , however , is the start of the sideslip into lack of realism , self-righteousness and fundamentalism .
What is this sideways shift ?
In the first place , there is the bureaucratic sideslip with the business of the label .
We are putting labels on everything .
Indeed , the ecologist ' s neurosis is revealed by the fact that the subject of labelling is raised .
We have labels on meat , wine , GM products , chocolate .
It is the trump card that beats any freedoms .
Thus proving that tobacco affects not only the lungs but also the brain .
This is clearly not , however , a sensible measure .
Let me give one example : tobacco was introduced into Europe at the same time as the potato .
What does that prove ?
This is the sideslip into self-righteousness and hypocrisy .
We are told that there are social costs .
Yet the smoker pays excise duties of between 75 and 85 % included in the price of tobacco .
In my own country , revenue from excise duties is greater than that from recording rights .
In other words , by smoking , the smoker is paying for the cost of his own cancer treatment .
Then there is the puritanical sideslip .
The rapporteur sends a shiver down my spine when he speaks of social aberrations , social instincts .
I hear : moral order , the Salem witches .
It is the same puritanical streak shared by Robespierre , Pol Pot , the Greens and the Quakers .
It is only totalitarian regimes that attempt to regulate the happiness of their citizens .
What are we to think of this crude misuse of Articles 95 and 152 ?
What are we to think of the rejection voted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market ?
This affects one million jobs in Europe .
As you will have understood , we shall be voting against this directive .
Is it too much to ask that Articles 95 and 152 be respected ?
All we are asking for is a minimum of subsidiarity and a modicum of tolerance .
This is a major industry which , moreover , hires more women than men to do seasonal work .
We are concerned as to whether this instrument will genuinely be an effective means of reducing tobacco consumption .
I should not like to think that this might be our objective .
Tobacco is no ordinary product of course .
We also know about its addictive effect .
Typical use of cigarettes is extremely dangerous , life-threateningly so .
I very much welcome the emphasis which Mr Maaten placed on the dangers of passive smoking .
The product is far too dangerous .
What can we do as regulators ?
We should be able to admit to this .
I should like briefly to mention the matter of the potential unemployment created by this directive .
Jobs in the industry have been " rationalised " by 50 % .
It is therefore not true that the directive will cause job losses .
The production and consumption of tobacco increased dramatically in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries .
Tobacco generates big bucks .
Non-smokers run risks too because they are obliged to inhale the smoke of those smoking around them .
This is not about one case in isolation but about the responsibility of all of us together .
This is not how we treat consumers of heroin or cocaine .
Some opponents of the currently proposed measures blame the rapporteur for making outrageous proposals .
I believe it has to precede it .
Having established that , we can then discuss any other justifications we may wish to .
Last century , smoking was part of the culture . It was important and provided a sense of security .
Now , however , we have to turn that culture on its head .
Mr President , smoking forms a serious threat to public health .
In the European Union , more than half a million people die each year as a result of smoking .
Due to the addictive effect , it appears very difficult to stop smoking .
Unfortunately , it is still the case that many young people take up smoking .
I do , however , have two further remarks to make .
It is high time that these subsidies were phased out gradually down to zero .
I am sorry to see that over the years there has been no development in their arguments .
Every year , tobacco kills more people .
Yet when it comes to the greatest killer drug of all , we apply different rules .
There is no consistency and we say that people should be allowed to choose for themselves .
And we should accept that fact : advertising does work .
We should seek to turn the tables on them .
We should follow the Canadian example and ensure that advertising is used effectively .
And the bigger the better .
The tiny label of 10 % which we have at present is not effective then .
We need warnings which are much bigger .
But 80 % of new smokers are young people under the age of 18 .
The traditional warning that smoking harms your health cuts no ice with them .
I would like to add one other point .
Fellow MEPs , I would like to call on you to back Jules Maaten ' s excellent report .
Most of it is imported .
Let us use it intelligently .
Descriptions such as low tar , mild and light must in future be banned .
Such slick advertising by tobacco manufacturers must not be permitted .
The truth is that people inhale more deeply to get the taste and so can actually damage themselves more .
Such labels are deceptive and dangerous and should be banned .
The export issue is probably the most difficult .
Our governments must stop this and we must stop them supporting it .
On behalf of the Socialist Group , we support this compromise .
We reject the view that the legal basis of the report is wrong .
It would be absurd to make each Member State test separately .
Despite these reservations , I hope the general thrust of the report will receive strong support from Parliament .
Mr President , allow me to adopt a rather Swedish and personal tone .
That would be devastating .
These tobacco products are most certainly and without any doubt harmful to health .
Passive smoking is probably the most insidious effect of tobacco .
We can experience this on a daily basis , both in this Assembly and in this House too .
At that time , it was not only cool to smoke , but it was even useful .
Rather tubby young ladies , in particular , were extremely well served by cigarettes .
Fifteen years ago , my husband contracted a serious lung disease .
We would also like to have a positive list of additives .
It is important that we fight delaying tactics today .
The EU already regulates health warnings and tar yields .
They have a right to know that " light " and " mild " branding is misleading .
People inhale more if they have a light cigarette than any other cigarette .
The health warning should be large and explicit .
We must warn of the dangers of passive smoking .
I know the dangers of smoking and the dangers of passive smoking .
I started smoking when I was 11 years old .
I ended up smoking 40 a day .
My health has been damaged by smoking .
There was no warning when I took up smoking .
Maybe I would not have taken it up if there had been .
Now I am the victim of passive smoking .
I have asthma attack after asthma attack .
I am a good example of why we should adopt this report now .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , smoking is unhealthy and smokers should be aware of this .
The European Union too , should know that smoking is unhealthy .
In fact , it should put its money where its mouth is .
We have to attach clear health requirements to the goods within the internal market .
Additives which encourage addiction should be banned at the earliest opportunity , as far as I am concerned .
The other aspect of the Union policy is the issue of tobacco subsidies .
Smoking is unhealthy .
We are all agreed on this , but should we be sharing this with the entire world ?
This is one of the most interesting and principle questions in today ' s debate .
It would be a considerable change in policy if we were to impose European standards on other countries .
The question is whether we want this .
To impose standards on other countries can come across as presumptuous , moralistic or patronising .
After all , other countries can set their own standards which industry has to comply with .
What strikes me in the debate is that we seem to overlook the objective of this directive .
The proposed warnings on the packet completely miss the point .
Whatever the dimensions , the information will remain ineffective .
In this respect , I congratulate Mr Maaten on his work .
It involves the legitimate and fair way of life of hundreds of modest families .
In this respect , a proposal of time limits may seem logical .
I find it sad that there are MEPs who are trying to weaken the Commission ' s proposal .
I am thinking , for instance , of the discussion about the legal base .
In my opinion , this is a ridiculous discussion .
In my opinion , what is at issue here is an unnecessary impairment of public health .
We have an opportunity of doing something about that this week .
We must pass this report into law and thus save lives .
The reality that smoking kills is not getting across at the moment .
Adoption of the directive would open the possibility for the improvement of health for millions .
We have the opportunity and responsibility to act positively on this today .
I believe that nobody can rationally oppose this .
Why not simply talk about the processing of tobacco ?
Why not talk about this processing ?
There is no way that I can accept this request for the removal of aid to tobacco .
However , this harmonisation directive should be restricted to harmonising .
That is a comment from one of the leading trade unions in Germany .
The final point I would make is a little plea to the Commissioner .
If his support cannot be strong , it can at least be mild !
In conclusion , the moral principle is acceptable but the solution is unsatisfactory .
We have a duty to take action .
Reducing consumption will cause a decrease in production .
Health problems will not be solved tomorrow by importing 100 % of our tobacco .
I totally agree with Mr Martinez who spoke earlier .
I support anyone who protects health .
I am in favour of this report but I do not agree with its hypocrisy .
We must be more courageous !
That kills over 500,000 EU citizens - half a million of our citizens .
It would be cheaper to go out and shoot them .
It would save money on health services .
As you have gathered , I am an intolerant non-smoker .
That is my plea .
Can we not get the marketing message to them ?
We would have to protect the tobacco farmers .
There would have to be alternatives , but surely it can be done .
We must find alternatives .
We must correct that anomaly .
In my country nicotine replacement therapy is only available by medical prescription .
What is the difference ?
The state should fund it .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Maaten , for his valuable work .
Plenary should adopt the report in the form presented in that Committee .
The fact is that tobacco kills .
We have to fight the tobacco companies using their own weapons .
For many , smoking is not a question of choice or pleasure .
This will also be important in the prevention of harm caused by passive smoking .
This is not the way to solve the problem of smoking .
On the contrary , we need to engage in an anti-smoking campaign .
Consequently , I shall not vote in favour of this proposal .
We must not create unemployment and underemployment in poor regions of the European Union .
Now we want to repeal them .
It is wrong ; we need to be consistent and coherent .
It proposes reducing the level of tar in cigarettes , their main carcinogenic component .
I am aware that some in Parliament would prefer to ban such descriptions immediately .
However , I do not consider that this is appropriate .
The amendments proposed in this report are of a very high quality .
I should now like to set out the Commission 's position on the amendments proposed .
A total of 48 amendments have been proposed in this report .
The accepted amendments include the proposal to increase the size of labels .
In this connection the cooperation of the tobacco industry will be essential .
I should now like to turn to the other 71 amendments submitted last Thursday .
Of these the Commission can accept a further 34 - either totally or in part .
In particular , I would mention that this proposal is a recasting of three existing internal market directives .
This convention aims to put in place worldwide tobacco product standards .
This is a necessary first step before we can go any further .
It would be premature at this stage to introduce bans on particular substances .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Accidental or deliberate marine pollution
It is a catastrophe .
However , it must be said that there have been a number of incidents .
In 1985 , there was a leak into the sea at Hinkley Point .
In 1986 , 135 cubic metres of radioactive water was released into the sea at Wylfa .
This report acknowledges the need for establishing cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution .
The public 's trust in the authorities is important to ensure adequate response .
The Erika is a good example of that .
This is a prerequisite in the necessary information sharing with all parties .
What is the situation today ?
Implications for the environment and for animal life have been tragic , and there are still serious threats .
This proves , once again , that the principle of ' polluter pays ' is not being applied .
This would therefore make it possible to include illegal degassing and any other source of pollution .
We must also stress the importance of research .
Cooperation and the exchange of know-how must be encouraged and supported in this highly technical field .
There are international conventions on the Mediterranean and the Baltic , which already fulfil this purpose .
On the same grounds , I do not think there is any point in providing for a management committee .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to say a few words on accidents at sea .
It is also often the case that cargo goes overboard .
Either way , the marine environment is polluted .
According to European Commission officials , radioactive cargo is implicitly covered in the text .
I would invite Commissioner Wallström to take a stand on this issue , explicitly so .
The European Union will have to take action on this issue to and work towards establishing international standards .
France did not have enough anti-pollution vessels to deal with this oil slick .
Fortunately , the British , Germans , Dutch and Norwegians spontaneously came to our assistance .
We therefore agree with the philosophy behind this report .
We think that extending cooperation to neighbouring maritime countries is a good idea .
The sea is our international heritage , and protecting it is a matter for international responsibility .
Recognition of the principle of ' polluter pays ' is essential .
At the present time , the owner of the potentially polluting products is not held accountable for the pollution .
In practice , only the carrier is accused .
I welcome Ms McKenna 's report .
I would like to pay tribute to her for her work .
Let us not miss the opportunity which this report affords .
Mrs McKenna ' s report offers us an opportunity to include radioactive substances .
Let us please , ladies and gentlemen , not hesitate for even a moment .
Let us avoid a disaster and vote in favour of the amendment to include nuclear substances .
Mr President , there is an important meeting on 26 June of the OSPAR commission in Copenhagen .
This will include the cessation of nuclear reprocessing and associated activities at the Sellafield and Thorp plants .
This in turn will play a key role in reducing marine pollution in the Irish Sea .
I would like to compliment Mrs McKenna on her excellent report .
This report proposes a range of different measures for improving the safety of marine transport .
Even if the best preventive measures are taken , there will never be no risk at all of accidents .
The Council has included most of these amendments in its common position .
Amendment 16 acknowledges the important role played by non-governmental environmental organisations in this area .
Parts of Amendments 6 , 24 and 25 make the scope of the directive clear .
Amendment 22 introduces an important reference to the polluter-pays principle .
The Commission cannot therefore approve these amendments .
So what kind of protection is there ?
There is Directive 96 / 29 / Euratom on the establishment of basic safety standards .
It is a system which operates 24 hours a day .
On this issue , the Commission supported the European Parliament at first reading .
The Commission nonetheless believes that the text of the common position constitutes a reasonable solution .
Amendments 5 and 9 introduce a definition of accidental marine pollution .
Amendments 5 and 9 cannot , therefore , be approved .
Enlarging the proposed framework for cooperation would unfortunately lead to a number of administrative and resource problems .
The Commission considers that the common position constitutes an acceptable way of meeting these justified requirements .
Other amendments cannot be approved .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
( The sitting was suspended at 1.06 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Substances that deplete the ozone layer
We also know how we can escape from this problem .
It sounds like an easy equation , but it is unfortunately more complicated than that .
There are so many interested parties involved in a question like this .
Our task has been to produce an acceptable plan for the way development should look .
At second reading , Parliament adopted ten amendments to the Council ' s common position .
The Council was able to accept seven of these amendments without any problems .
There are nonetheless still three outstanding problems .
At the final stage , three mistakes were discovered in the proposed wording of the Act .
I believe we have found a compromise of benefit to all parties .
It has therefore been held up as exemplary .
This is extremely worrying .
I should also like to respond to the question put earlier .
I shall reply in English .
Thank you , Commissioner Liikanen .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Digital television in the European Union
This is still the case , of course .
But I am still sorry that she is unable to attend .
My first pre-condition is that we need to do more in the field of standardisation and interoperability .
We need to avoid this at all costs .
This is a step in the right direction .
It has to come from the industry .
A solution must then be found on a political plane as a last resort .
My second remark concerns open access .
It is also a cultural Europe .
I want to thank Mr van Velzen for his work in introducing the debate during my absence .
I think it is important that we remember how matters stood when the directive was adopted .
This is also crucial when it comes to the electronic program guides .
It is these two factors which the forthcoming provisions should especially concentrate on .
The rapporteur ' s conclusion is that open standards are now needed .
We are now seeing the second and third generation of equipment for digital television .
There are good reasons for accepting that this standard will form a basis for the future .
These distribution systems at present have different degrees of penetration , but satellite distribution is the dominant system .
Tomorrow , distribution by cable may , however , gain ground .
In the background are issues of copyright .
It is therefore of utmost importance that a favourable investment climate be created for digital television within Europe .
After all , we are at the dawn of a new era .
This is a pattern which is emerging throughout the industry .
Infrastructure and content industry are coming together .
This means that two aspects should be monitored effectively .
This is an unwanted development .
This means digital television but also television without frontiers .
I said , " I am going to speak on the Thors report . "
" But what is this Thors report ? "
Can I see what my pension will amount to when I retire ? "
You will even be able to see what is happening in the pension companies of other States . "
I wish to mention one or two problems connected with this issue .
Firstly , I support the open standard and compatibility : that is only sensible .
Competition alone does not guarantee it .
This is a big issue , and it relates to access .
In general , I support the notion that technical systems are not neutral .
They make some things possible more than others .
In any case , we should place greater emphasis on actions aimed at implementation .
Today , we are coming to realise that it enables vast flexibility and quantity .
It was certainly important to sum up the situation regarding digital television at the present time .
It is a focused report .
I should like to conclude by making a link to the next debate on electronic communications .
They will have different forms of competition .
Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Thors for her excellent work .
The Commission welcomes this report .
It raises the need for a balanced approach to regulation .
The new regulatory framework will provide regulators with much greater flexibility to achieve this balance .
First , the need to update ex ante regulations for digital television .
The new framework will allow regulators to address new gateways such as Applications Programme Interface .
The Commission will address these issues in its upcoming legislative proposals .
Third , the need for increased interoperability between different television platforms .
More specifically , the report singles out two key elements .
The Commission prefers an industry-led approach rather than imposing standards .
We have reserve powers to intervene if the market actors cannot agree .
However , the market is developing open standards .
The use of open standards reduces both regulation and the number of competition cases .
The report signals this clear message to the market place very strongly .
I fully support this .
As far as possible , we must separate the network and content regulation .
The reception of encrypted digital television services across borders raises several difficult issues .
Even digital free-to-air services are being encrypted .
This creates tensions with single market principles for pay-TV services .
Differing approaches to content regulation may also play a role .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Electronic communications and associated services
Mr President , I would like to start by thanking those I have worked alongside .
A rapporteur without such sound qualitative input is only a small cog in a big machine .
This is completely new .
I honestly hope that the Commission will move further in the direction we have proposed .
The markets are moving extremely fast . The developments transcend national borders .
We are witnessing all kinds of vertical and horizontal integrations .
As far as this is concerned , we will need to grow towards one European internal market .
This also means that I can see two developments in this field , which cause me some concern .
We also need to ask ourselves how long we need to continue the specific sector supervision .
Mr President , another important point is 112 , caller location .
If something happens to me , it should be possible to trace me immediately .
This is why this caller location facility is so vital .
But it is also important to combat the abuse of 112 .
This does mean , however , that the user should grant permission to set this up .
Mr President , a serious problem is the democratic hole within the entire ICT sector .
I have thanked the Commissioner .
That is democracy .
He has done an enormous amount of work on the amendments to reach a compromise .
The liberalisation of the telecommunications markets has advanced by leaps and bounds in recent years in Europe .
The Commission must give assurances that these obstacles to competition are removed as promptly as possible .
We cannot , however , simply concentrate on wireless communications .
The situation regarding competition in the fixed networks must also be radically improved .
Otherwise , people living in remote areas , in particular , will be at a disadvantage .
I hope that I will receive unambiguous answers to these questions .
Where we have not guessed correctly , we have been able to put things right .
This is why this report is so important .
Finally , I would like to draw attention to Amendments Nos 3 and 4 .
We still have 15 partially liberalised and still largely segmented markets .
What we have here is the basis for opening up the European Union market in a genuine sense .
That is not being technology-neutral .
We do not think that this would be in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity .
There is no reason for requiring a merger in this context .
What is more , we have a very great variety of solutions in different Member States .
We are indeed dealing with a market .
That much is certain . Everything is moving in that direction .
It remains to be seen , however , what sort of a society we are dealing with .
May we hope for some consistency on this ?
Next , what form can a universal service take nowadays ?
What undertakings must Europe and the Member States set themselves in this regard ?
This brings me to the matter of content .
It might be feared that our reintroducing this question could be taken for an automatic reflex on our part .
At the present time , 94 of the world ' s 106 most visited web sites are American .
Is it , however , possible that the matter has become urgent today ?
I would like to focus on a few points relating to this important report .
The Union must keep pace with the technological changes which are taking place globally at this time .
In many ways , the Union is ahead of the United States of America in the field of technology .
EU-technology in mobile-phone systems is well advanced .
Most Union countries have extensive competition in the field of mobile-phone markets .
The European Union is behind the United States of America with the Internet .
The Commissioner has started this process of looking into mechanisms to guarantee consumer protection .
Mr President , today we are looking into a new legislative framework for the communications infrastructure .
These rules require the necessary flexibility , as rapporteur Van Velzen pointed out with good reason .
After all , it is unclear what the future holds for that sector .
Fair competition is vital to suppliers .
Pre-conditions are important to consumers too .
The Commission ' s current stance against child pornography and racism are good examples of this .
However , there is a need for standards which apply universally and worldwide .
The Communist Party of Greece is fundamentally opposed to such policies .
Even yesterday ' s competitors are coming to private agreements and arrangements , thereby adulterating the competition .
My final point concerns the question of universal service , which has already been mentioned earlier .
Everything we are talking about shows how fast the market is changing .
The value added , the commercial potential of every connection is going up all the time .
We need an analysis of the situation as a whole from the Commission .
In my opinion , the digital divide has already happened .
Then there is the universal service , about which my learned colleague , Mr Harbour , spoke .
I want to say one last word on spectrum auctions .
Let me add four points , which I consider are important , to this debate .
Mr President , I too should like to congratulate Mr van Velzen on an excellent report .
We also need more transparency , especially in roaming and international tariffs .
Governments should not be trying to judge who will be innovative and successful .
It has been suggested that auctions are simply a device to provide extra money for governments .
That is wrong .
It has also been claimed that licence costs will just be passed on to the consumer .
I do not believe so .
Auctions allow the market to determine the commercial value of scarce radio spectrum .
More importantly , they give greater opportunities to new market entrants .
Beauty contests often favour incumbents with established track records .
I believe this report will help us reach this goal .
Only time will show what the most rational solution will be .
The danger of too much regulation must also be taken into account in good time .
I would like to ask the Commissioner how the Commission intends to promote this ' co-regulation ' approach .
How will it be possible for Parliament to exert sufficient influence ?
Many important things have been said .
We also share an understanding of how sector-specific rules can contribute to this objective .
Looking in the same direction is an important step in ensuring that everyone reaches the desired destination .
With regard to the fast adoption of directives , the Commission totally agrees .
However , of course we are ready to discuss any comments made in the report .
The Commission accepts that there is a certain tension between legal certainty and flexibility .
This sends the right signals to markets .
We must consider the alternatives at the end of the process .
Mr van Velzen has sent me a written question on the auctions .
I will return to this issue in the formal way .
The same question was put by Mrs Matikainen-Kallström .
It is making an ongoing assessment of the economic impact of procedures used .
Mrs Matikainen-Kallström put forward the question about local laws and also put the question about the local loop .
How can we guarantee that the liberalisation of the last mile will take place ?
I find it a very important issue .
The first question is : could this part be separated out to get it through more quickly ?
But I agree with your concern that the question of the local loop is the biggest issue this year .
Mr Glante asked the question of who decides what .
This is a big issue which we have discussed in many contexts .
Some people say we should have a European regulator to guarantee full European coherence on those issues .
We shall come back to that issue in our final proposal .
EU strategy on financial information
In its communication , the Commission proposes to completely overhaul this situation .
This is a major change which directly impacts on approximately seven thousand companies .
This mechanism must be pro-active in providing input to the IASC in order to establish new standards .
This EU approval mechanism will comprise a political and technical aspect .
The political aspect will encompass all Member States .
How it will take shape exactly is still to be decided on .
It is , of course , crucially important that the standards also be applied correctly in practice .
This requires close cooperation between the Member States and between the authorities responsible for supervision on the capital market .
Seven thousand companies are required to do this before the year 2005 and this will be quite something .
I hesitate to answer this question in the affirmative .
It is thus up to that committee from the private sector to lay down these standards .
Everyone should then adhere to them .
Thank you , Commissioner .
That concludes the debate .
( The sitting was suspended until voting time at 5.30 p.m. )
Mr President , on a point of order .
I should be grateful if the ashtrays could be removed again from outside the Chamber .
The President asked for them to be removed and they were removed .
People stopped smoking out there and they have now been returned .
I understand that somebody has ordered their return , against the President 's wishes .
As I keep on having asthma attacks , I hope they will be removed again .
We will certainly try to have that put right , Mrs Lynne .
( Parliament approved the Commission proposal )
Procedure without debate ( Rule 114 ) :
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the decision )
( Parliament adopted the decision )
( Parliament adopted the joint text )
Bolkestein , Commission .
The Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 16 , 19 and 22 .
The Commission can accept in part Amendments Nos 6 , 17 , 24 and 25 .
The Commission cannot accept the remaining amendments .
( The President declared the common position approved as amended )
Last time , I declared an interest in the radio and television broadcasting sector .
I must now repeat this statement with regard to this report .
I shall not therefore take part in any votes on the matter .
The report , which was later referred to on BBC News , contained a number of inaccuracies .
It must be said that is not really appropriate in the middle of voting time .
Mr President , just for the benefit of Members regarding the last statement made by Mr McMillan-Scott .
Colleagues , let us try to address ourselves to the business in hand .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Mr President , due to a financial interest I cannot participate in the next vote .
On Amendment No 10
I am afraid we cannot have a split vote .
It is out of time .
That is the starting point and it should be mentioned here .
So this means that I have to point out that the text should read : to clarify .
( Parliament adopted the resolution ) President .
That concludes the vote .
Therefore , the entire institution of the immunity of Members of the European Parliament must be reformed .
Report Zimeray ( A5-0158 / 2000 )
Mr President , I voted against the application to withdraw parliamentary immunity .
In my opinion , Mr Zimeray should continue to enjoy parliamentary immunity .
Our fellow Member committed a road traffic offence , which is a culpable offence but not a crime .
In Italy , this type of offence does not merit withdrawal of parliamentary immunity .
Report Hulthén ( A5-0161 / 2000 )
I therefore feel that it is right for the European Parliament to intervene in this matter .
There will be a measure to prevent the hole in the ozone from becoming any larger .
Britain 's Labour Government has been leading the fight to protect our citizens and to clean up our planet .
At Kyoto , Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott managed to secure an agreement to cut global emissions .
This target has now been raised to 60-70 % by 2050 .
This is our chance to continue our battle for a safer , cleaner world .
Report McKenna ( A5-0148 / 2000 )
I therefore support this report which will prevent the dumping of waste in the sea .
By rights this tragedy should have had the effect of seriously reorienting Community procedure .
This was , unfortunately , not the case , and the procedure stands .
On the key issues , we are still waiting .
Indeed , the IOPCF apparatus looks particularly perverse .
This time the necessary debates and the necessary action must not be postponed .
Fortunately , this House adopted the amendment confirming the principle of ' polluter pays ' .
This is a small step in the right direction .
Report Thors ( A5-0143 / 2000 )
. Major changes to European culture that will happen as a result of digital technology are welcome .
However , continued good public service broadcasting is essential .
It will also be a key driver of digital take-up , extending its appeal .
Digital TV is the only convergent technology without basic interoperability .
This will promote interoperability without undermining innovation .
Where this occurs , the Member State should be free to set its own priorities .
Report Van Velzen ( A5-0145 / 2000 )
On all the other points Mr van Velzen has our full support .
I hope that this will happen .
It is high time , however , that we put this fine European idea into practice .
In pursuing the interests of untrammelled competition , the European Parliament does itself no credit .
That concludes the explanations of vote .
Question Time ( Commission )
The next item is Question Time ( B5-0487 / 2000 ) . We will examine questions to the Commission .
It falls within the competence of the Presidency of Parliament .
Question No 29 by ( H-0452 / 00 ) :
Does the Commission have any strategy for this sensitive region ?
In future our support will be specifically targeted on these structural objectives .
Have you , the Commission , done anything ?
As I am sure you understand , this problem is seriously hampering the political situation in Georgia .
I very much agree that the refugee issue is a burning problem .
We are one of the main contributors to the work concerning refugees in the whole region .
Also the International Organization for Migration is involved with our support .
People are greatly concerned at what they hear about the present situation in Georgia .
Democratic rights , employment rights , religious rights are all under very severe pressure .
Is there nothing more that he and this Union can do to help this new state ?
Basically I will have to repeat what I have just said .
Question No 30 by ( H-0437 / 00 ) :
Does the Commission consider that Cuba can maintain its observer status under the new agreement ?
Would the Commission have been in favour of Cuba 's signing up to the convention ?
This decision has been entirely their own .
I can confirm that the Commission is in the process of preparing to implement this analysis .
The results of the analysis should be available round about the middle of 2001 .
I am also very grateful for your reply myself .
Does it intend to implement any urgent measure ?
The analysis is expected to be fully completed in a year from now .
It is not clear from the outset that the new EU / ACP Agreement will have an adverse impact .
We will follow this very closely .
We want to have a thorough analysis of the situation before we come up with specific proposals .
Question No 32 by ( H-0444 / 00 ) :
I want to thank the Commissioner for her answer .
Restructuring must not be prevented .
Question No 33 by ( H-0473 / 00 ) :
Questions to Mr Busquin
I wish to thank the Commissioner for her response .
Maybe we could be innovative .
Commissioner , you have us as your partners to drive that forward .
I agree .
However , there is a risk of taking it too far .
Question No 34 by ( H-0507 / 00 ) :
This was a welcome step .
However , only one further item of correspondence has been received .
On a related subject , provision has been made for a mid term review of the Fifth Framework Programme .
Could the Commission reaffirm its commitment to provide information on the implementation of the Fifth Framework Programme ?
Does the Commission believe it is still worthwhile completing outstanding projects from the Third and Fourth Framework Programmes ?
Could the Commission say when it is likely to produce a mid-term review of the Fifth Framework programme ?
Questions to Mr Liikanen
Does the Commission believe that these policies could be applied to the research budget ?
Furthermore , procedures have been revised since the Fourth Framework Programme .
Question No 35 by ( H-0445 / 00 ) :
First of all , the background for problems in the export fund is budgetary .
We have had the decisions for Agenda 2000 since Berlin 1999 .
These specific measures are designed to replace the across-the-board cuts currently in place .
These observations also covered the question of spirits .
In the course of this discussion the Commission will supply detailed information justifying its approach .
Unfortunately , I do not yet have a report from the meeting .
That is very important .
I ask him to direct his attention to that .
We are very well aware that whisky is a very important product in some areas of Scotland .
I will pay attention to the issues which were raised by the honourable Member .
Question No 36 by ( H-0448 / 00 ) :
Gas-fuelled cars emit lower levels of most hydrocarbons , but more methane .
However , gas vehicles emit high levels of methane .
Derogations are not provided for in the European system for type approval .
I should like to thank the Commission for its answer .
- Thank you for the question .
I will be happy to inform the honourable Member of the outcome at a later date .
Question No 37 by ( H-0467 / 00 ) :
Mr President , first I want to express my gratitude for this question .
So if the infrastructure is there , the importance of distance will be less .
Outside this issue , it is very much a question of the Member States .
I would thank the Commissioner for his answer .
I really do believe that this is a major priority for us now , and time flies .
I believe now would be an opportune moment for the Commission to put forward proposals .
The issue of auctions will be carefully monitored .
I am sure we will come back to this issue later .
Question No 38 by ( H-0477 / 00 ) :
I thank the Commissioner for his reply .
We are analysing what points of the action plan it is most important to tackle soon .
Questions to Mrs Reding
Question No 42 by ( H-0438 / 00 ) :
There is a lack of agreement between Member States , even among Sports Ministers .
There is a lack of agreement .
This is why many Community programmes are open for such organisations to take part .
What is more , next year , sport will be a priority objective in the Youth Programme .
Commissioner , you give a very full response .
I would have liked such a response to the written question which I sent to you .
Your answer simply referred me to the Commission 's opinion on the IGC .
I can read documents .
I wanted your personal view on Mrs Zabell 's question about legal issues .
We have a tradition with the Treaty of Amsterdam of using protocols to protect specific characteristics .
We could perhaps look at the potential of a protocol to protect the specific characteristic of sport in Europe .
I shall ensure that answers to written questions are more complete in future .
Let me give you a concrete example .
This , then , is a problem which , as you can see , we are tackling unremittingly .
If you wish to achieve something , then you must lobby your own governments .
As the author is not present , Question No 43 lapses .
As they deal with the same subject , Questions Nos 44 and 45 will be taken together .
Question No 44 by ( H-0504 / 00 ) :
Subject : CONNECT initiative The CONNECT initiative was launched in 1999 at the European Parliament 's instigation .
Ninety-one of the 517 projects submitted have been co-financed by the Commission .
What is the Commission 's assessment of the initiative 's first year of operation ?
If not , how can the discontinuation of the initiative with effect from 2002 be justified ?
Question No 45 by ( H-0505 / 00 ) :
Since then , 91 of the 267 projects submitted have been co-financed by the Commission .
It is obvious that an assessment can only be made once some progress has been made in the projects .
So , let us give it some time and let the projects develop .
I feel the content of CONNECT is extremely important , whatever it is called .
As you can see , it all hangs together .
Commissioner , I would like to offer a brief reminder .
The Commission intends to make the most of the results and to disseminate them within the Member States .
You may rest assured that Parliament will be consulted in deciding the nature of this follow-up .
Question No 46 by ( H-0506 / 00 ) :
A public hearing on radio was held on 24 May 2000 .
Commissioner , your answer was most helpful .
Whether or not MEDIA PLUS also covers commercial risks is indeed an issue .
The question is : why have you not found a way to support radio ?
So there is a problem here .
Consequently , the question remains .
I should like to inform the honourable Member that MEDIA PLUS has no industrial aspect whatsoever .
It is aid for the distribution of European films beyond national frontiers .
Would it be possible to reduce prices ?
As you can see , there are still a great many problems to be solved at Member State level .
Otherwise , MEDIA PLUS focuses on the promotion and distribution of European films , particularly in cinemas .
In this way , even then , the television aspect is not greatly affected .
That concludes Questions to the Commission .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.44 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
Historical liabilities from JRC nuclear activities
Finally , this financing method is also at odds with the principle of transparency .
Indeed , it is not made clear how much money is reserved for decommissioning activities .
The Committee on Budgets has rejected this working method .
I hope that Parliament can support this proposal made by the Committee on Budgets .
The time has now come , however , to decommission the installations in this sector .
This , however , must be done in a controlled way .
We must invest more in the disposal of radioactive waste .
A sustainable model for a solution already exists .
It was an exemplary way of setting about proceeding on what is a very difficult issue .
The methodology , however , is quite inadequate and can only be very temporary .
This is not current research .
Conclusion 9 spells that out most clearly , and I fully support it .
The traditional budgetary procedure is inadequate and inappropriate for the reasons that have been stated by colleagues .
Not least , it is far too uncertain for a very important task like this .
The trialogue is urgently needed .
This work must be done in the safest possible conditions .
We cannot have any corners cut in an area where it would actually be dangerous to do so .
It must be done properly and properly financed ; no cutting down on the amount of cooling time .
Certainly not !
Those people are getting older and will retire .
This can lead to complications during decommissioning activities and can also result in additional financial problems .
Madam President , the issue of the decommissioning of nuclear waste is a very serious one .
On nuclear waste it is important to emphasise that no solution has been found .
Already we have examples of new installations not being commissioned and a re-examination of policy by some Member States .
We are living in a time of increasing awareness of the environment and public health .
On these issues , the public are seeking assurances beyond reasonable doubt .
The decision last week to close Chernobyl is belatedly welcome .
The impact of Sellafield on public health and the environment is now a matter of fact .
A problem in this respect is the fact that the total decommissioning process takes up several decades .
It will therefore be some time before we have learned from practical experience how to decommission old nuclear plants .
In addition , there is no solution in sight as to how to solve the problem of radioactive waste .
It will be evident that this state of affairs also has a bearing on finances .
This raises the suspicion that decommissioning is seen as unimportant .
In my opinion , this is a gross underestimation of the cost of decommissioning .
It also implies that the price charged for electricity generated by nuclear energy is too low .
We must bear in mind that times change and the standards change with them .
So , perhaps colleagues should be cautious before we criticise this proposal .
I support the proposal for a trialogue .
It seems the sensible approach .
The work must be done and has to be paid for somehow .
I hope that he will promote this dialogue at every given opportunity .
In any event , I would like to thank him for his report .
This legacy , however , cannot be refused .
We are lumbered with it and will have to deal with it in some way or another .
I would , however , like to make one comment regarding the report .
From this point of view , I also beg to differ with Mr Chichester .
These territories contain many nuclear power stations which will have to be closed or decommissioned in forthcoming years .
I tabled two questions on the Ispra issue but I did not receive satisfactory responses .
A number of points raised in this report have already been answered .
I consider transparency to be absolutely crucial and I share your feeling on this .
The documents are available and we are available to discuss them .
Indeed , this sum applied only to installations already shut down .
Implementation of this action programme has already started .
I now come to the most sensitive and problematic aspect of the matter : financing .
So this initial solution was adopted as a pragmatic option .
This is what we want , and , I think , what Parliament wants too .
We have every reason to adopt a pragmatic and responsible approach .
Mrs Plooij van-Gorsel spoke of this .
The Commission does not wish to dodge the issue , as it specified in its communication .
The Commission also mentioned that the solutions adopted by Member States are not easy to apply at Community level .
Whatever the case , I must thank Parliament for its interest and for its responsible proposals .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Restrictions for products subject to excise duties ( Sweden )
I also welcome Commissioner Bolkestein ' s dynamic approach in this respect .
This development results in great economic expansion and has led to more prosperity in Europe .
There is , therefore , no doubt in my mind as to the general benefits of the internal market .
This is clearly an issue which also has major public health implications .
Beer is produced in Sweden .
In principle , fiscal measures are a matter governed by national sovereignty .
Mr President , the general benefits to be had from the internal market are beyond dispute .
Matters being what they are , I should nonetheless like to ask the Commission the following questions .
Apparently Commissioner Bolkestein was opposed to extending this derogation .
Why have you changed your mind ?
I could continue , Madam President , but my speaking time is running out .
In these countries , these products ought perhaps to be taxed instead .
For a long time , this policy successfully held its own against influence from outside .
That is not the case today .
This is a good compromise which would give Sweden the opportunity to adapt to the new situation .
Mr Maaten has prepared a good report .
Border trade between Sweden and its neighbours is flourishing .
Now is the time to find new solutions .
A greater European input is needed in Sweden , but perhaps also a greater Swedish input in Europe .
It is extremely important to clarify the EU ' s own policy on this question .
What ought the Court of Justice of the European Communities to have said ?
I do not share that view .
This is the situation of alcoholic drink consumption in Sweden !
These figures are over three times as high as the official figures .
Let us take care , then !
It is the same problem .
I think that deadlines are there to be kept to .
Swedish alcohol policy is now in pieces .
I am concerned about this inability to get to grips with the real problems .
I would say to Göran Färm that there has been ample time to do something about this situation .
What makes imports of alcohol into more of a trade issue than a public health issue ?
For a family with three older children , this corresponds to 7 metric tons of alcohol per week .
Should that be a so-called right ?
Is that a level consistent with moderate consumption ?
Madam President , I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Maaten .
This arrangement would normally have expired at the end of this month .
Sweden has requested more time to adapt its alcohol policy .
I believe that the compromise which has been reached is fair and reasonable .
But at the same time , it provides for a short , further period of adjustment .
I am also delighted that Mr Maaten ' s report supports the Commission proposal .
But - once again - this exception was certainly not meant to last forever .
Mr Färm and Mrs Carlsson have already clarified the way in which it should be pursued .
This is the first point which I wanted to raise .
The second point concerns the harmonisation of excise duty on alcohol products .
The Commission might wish it had , but it has not .
So the report will contain recommendations , but the Commission does not have instruments at its disposal .
I would recommend Parliament to adopt Mr Maaten ' s report without amendments .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon .
Exchange of information with third countries
The problem is that this exchange generally involves a degree of non-compliance with the obligation to secrecy .
A final comment .
The simplification and coherence of the legislation may perhaps have required this .
We often have that dilemma within Member States .
That is a process that has been undertaken within the United Kingdom .
The approach of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has facilitated prompt adoption of the proposal .
The proposal is also a response to international recommendations on the exchange of confidential information .
It is necessary to improve supervision of financial conglomerates .
This is an aspect which was stressed by Mr Berenguer Fuster this evening and also Mr Evans .
Mr Evans has spoken of the consolidation of regulatory authorities .
That indeed is what happens in the United Kingdom .
That example is followed by Sweden , or perhaps it is the other way around .
In other words , both in London and in Stockholm there is a consolidated regulatory apparatus .
Within the FSA in London there is a unit working with banking .
There is another unit working with insurance undertakings and there is a third unit working with the stock exchange .
They are under one roof , but under that one roof there are still distinct entities .
Opinions differ very much indeed .
We are dealing here with a very sensitive question .
They say : we cooperate , so what is the worry ?
I am not saying that there is no reason to be worried .
It was welcomed by ECOFIN .
It is available on the Internet so anybody can take cognisance of it .
Nor does it deal with stock exchanges .
But thinking does not stop .
If it did we would be in a very bad position .
Everybody knows what has happened in other parts of the world in the way of systemic crises .
Also , everybody knows that the alliances between various stock exchanges are the order of the day .
This thinking has not led to any firm conclusions but it is continuing .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Imports of beer into Finland
Finland obtained an extension of this derogation until 2003 .
Finland also mentions problems to do with health , public order and loss of income .
In the meantime , such imports account for some 10 % of Finland ' s beer retail market .
The majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not agree with me on this .
This represents definite progress in relation to the current situation which may continue until 2003 .
There was a great deal of controversy in committee regarding the problem of alcoholism .
Let us put an end to hypocrisy , and let us give up on solutions that do not work .
Make of it what you will !
This is what everything hinges on at the end of the day .
On the contrary , there is a good deal of research to show that it is in fact effective .
However , a whole range of new methods will certainly be required .
These include regulations on the importation of beer .
I would approach the problem , however , from the angle of the principle of subsidiarity .
All the statistics relating to alcohol consumption speak in favour of continuing with this policy .
On the other hand , I will admit that consumption is not evenly spread .
In Finland there are groups of alcohol abusers , such as the young , for example .
It is alcohol consumption among these groups that we aim to influence .
One reason for keeping stringent restrictions on imports is , for example , the matter of public order .
Finland ' s geographical position is very different from all the other EU countries .
Beyond our frontiers are countries where prices are low .
The discrimination between consumers who are citizens of other countries and Finnish consumers is clear and self-justifying .
On this point , we Radicals will support the amendments tabled by Mrs Lulling .
Our problem is the enormous difference in taxation .
The reason is obvious if you think about it for a moment .
The cost of alcohol fell .
That makes for a pretty powerful brew .
You can buy that virtually for the price of the bottle alone .
What production could be so cheap that you could compete with that ?
Besides , who will be bothered by this restriction on imports from the east ?
It will not bother anyone , at least not the EU .
It is being said here that taxation cannot reduce the consumption of alcohol .
What sort of experience have you had in this regard ?
Because we do have experience of it .
The first thing that the poor cut back on if prices rise is alcohol consumption .
There is research data on that .
Then you say that education helps .
I happen to come from a region where such education has been provided .
What happened ?
Vodka continues to be drunk as before , and on top of that there is wine .
In other words , total consumption is increasing .
And we still have an additional problem .
We have high taxation , which I used to be in favour of .
If private citizens are allowed to bring in more foreign beer , tax revenue will fall .
In other words , there is quite a significant double-edged problem .
That is the issue here .
We could have dealt with this issue in a more appropriate way .
It is also obvious that this is mainly a fiscal problem .
It is , as has been said , in actual fact a fiscal problem .
I have referred in part to points of order .
The Committee has introduced an addendum concerning Estonia , among other countries .
It is a question of not making a hasty decision .
The situation is very unequal , and there is a risk of its deteriorating further .
This is being done by 2004 , according to the deadline fixed in respect of the Internal Market .
Commissioner , you can surely ascertain that from what we Finns have been saying here in our speeches .
A number of these amendments concern the level of the tariffs applied by Finland .
Before , these restrictions were automatically incorporated into the restrictions within the Union .
This change will not require a change in the proposal .
The new date will most likely be 1 July of this year .
This concludes my comments .
I would once again like to express my thanks to the rapporteur .
He even suggested that I had reduced excise duties .
That would be a fine thing , if only I could .
As I was saying , I mean to make the most of my right to speak .
Mr Färm also criticised me for defending wine producers .
I am proud that I did though !
It would even be good for the social security department in Finland .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Statistics for trade between Member States
Indeed , the simplification must first and foremost benefit small and medium-sized companies .
The report was adopted unanimously without amendments within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
We entirely support his proposal to push this through without any amendments .
Why are we supporting this so strongly ?
Reading Mr Beysen 's report , the history of this proposal is rather depressing .
Surely it should not be taking this amount of time to work on largely technical areas .
Mr Beysen was talking about the way that Parliament has been working internationally on some of these issues .
Surely we should be setting our own house in order first .
I would like to congratulate them on their work .
However , you have raised a couple of issues .
Firstly , Mr Harbour asks how the process can be speeded up .
The Commission is not concern about the delay .
Nevertheless , we must recognise that we have two problems which we must address in a different way .
However , we hope that excessive time will not be required in order to arrive at these results .
Lastly , Mrs Berger asks us which additional initiatives we are going to take .
You have said correctly that this is a first step for us .
We believe that it is essential to go further with this process of simplification .
Before we start with the order of business , there are still a number of points of order .
His independent television is the only one that questions the behaviour of Russian troops in Chechnya .
Now we have this arrest and Mr Putin says he knows nothing about it .
This latest event leaves Russia teetering on the brink .
The European Parliament must do what it can to avert this catastrophe .
Thank you .
As you can hear from the applause , the House has taken note of your comment .
- ( NL ) Mr President , I would like to bring up another point .
These then degenerate into all-out bingeing sessions , at which point the cameras start to roll .
I think , Mr President , that that is unworthy of Parliament .
What I would like to ask through you is that these kinds of festivity be regulated properly .
I think that we can no longer afford this kind of behaviour .
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
In my opinion , this matter should be discussed in Parliament .
I have not quite understood the honourable member .
Are you saying that he did or did not vote ?
We shall clarify the matter .
( Parliament approved the Minutes )
I suggest that we keep to the chosen procedure with debate .
I now have another statement to make .
Yesterday Mr Lannoye moved to ...
( Interruption by Mr Brok )
Mr Brok , we have moved on to another point .
Now if you would be so kind as to take your seat , that would ease the tension somewhat .
There is another motion , but that is not it .
You have therefore not answered my question .
I believe I have because , as far as the procedure is concerned , we have two options .
We can do that separately and at different times .
But the Rules of Procedure do not require us to proceed in this way .
It makes no material difference ; at some point the House will have to state its view .
And , of course , that is not how it works .
I have taken note of the honourable member ' s comment .
Decision on urgent procedure
Thank you .
The chairman of the Committee on Agriculture has tabled a procedural motion .
Mrs Schierhuber has asked to speak .
He has outlined the matter quite clearly .
We reached a consensus on a great many points and the Commission too was willing to compromise .
As no one wishes to speak against the motion , we shall pass to the vote .
( Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure . )
Mr President , allow me a brief personal comment .
I therefore refute what Mr Seppänen has said .
Mr Korakas on a point of order .
We requested the amendments this morning between 8 and 8.30 and they were not available .
European political parties
The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions :
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to submit seven considerations on this important issue .
The group of the European People ' s Party and European Democrats deeply regrets this .
It is this which will enable a solution to be found .
Nonetheless , we take the firm view that supplementing the Treaty is the best way forward .
However , we are taking a constructive view .
The current situation is becoming increasingly complicated .
We managed to have the political parties recognised . In our countries they are a fundamental pillar of democracy .
We have taken an initiative across the various political groups , which we presented in February to President Prodi .
That really is what the debate is about in this House today .
The institutions must be able to deliver accountability and transparency .
Just as my colleagues have said , these parties must be brought out into the light of day .
They are , in any case , already active today .
They cannot replace the national parties , but cooperation among national parties is no longer necessarily enough .
But what is European awareness ?
The European culture is born of respect for our national cultures and national traditions .
So , à la Voltaire , if you want to talk to me , lay down the rules now .
European parties , let us not kid ourselves !
Before hearing the speakers for the groups , I would like to give the floor to Commissioner Barnier .
This is not just a question of money .
But a stronger European Parliament depends on strong groups in Parliament which have the authority to act .
We want a strong Commission which drives the European integration process forward .
But we must not underestimate the psychological importance of this debate .
At present people and national parties are elected .
The proposal was touched on at the intergovernmental conference .
I readily admit that we want European lists and European members of parliament .
The proposals have been made ; it all depends on the European party statute .
We shall comply with these demands .
We did not manage to have this included in the Treaty of Amsterdam .
The second step is the amendment of the Treaties .
But what we need is an initiative - albeit hopelessly overdue - from the Commission .
But there are questions left unanswered concerning the future too .
This seems a rhetorical question to me .
I hope that the Commission can give me a clear answer to it .
The main question raised is the extent to which they can actually represent a European public .
The situation is in fact quite paradoxical .
First , there are European parties .
Plus , the parties tend to take themselves very seriously .
I have nothing against European parties .
The criticism of the Court of Auditors was justified .
Mr President , I am a strong supporter of cooperation between peoples .
Many problems can only be solved jointly .
Global problems must be solved in the UN .
The court here in Strasbourg can support us in connection with human rights .
Would we obtain better democracy by downgrading the national parties and raising the profile of common supranational parties ?
The supranational EU parties will never win the hearts and minds of ordinary people .
Manifestos will be written by small groups of experts out of touch with the lives of real people .
An artificial product of that kind does not deserve financial support from the EU .
Mr President , this is a question of democracy .
The current European political parties do not represent transparency or public accessibility .
It is a rhetorical question , but who of us knows anything about the European political parties ?
They have been discovered in the investigations conducted by the Court of Auditors .
I suspect these abuses are now being covered up .
The European political parties do not represent democracy .
For rule by the nation , you need a nation .
Europe is not a nation ; it is nations .
We have no concept of supranational democracy .
Parties of parties are not democracy .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 12 noon .
Security and defence
The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions :
This development complements NATO , which will continue to remain responsible for collective security in Europe .
All that remains is Article 5 .
In the long run , this must be credibly sustained by the European Union .
This will surely help to develop a coherent foreign , security and defence policy .
This is unattainable at present for certain reasons , but we should strive towards it .
It is still our aim .
Defence is still a matter for national governments when it comes to equipment and similar questions .
This must be merged , including practically , so that such absurdities never occur again .
We must recognise the fact that we are squandering money in national budgets .
This also applies to transport , satellites and such like .
The views of Parliament shall be taken into consideration by the Council .
The budget for this organisation will also be substantially reduced .
If necessary , other working groups on specific issues may be created .
This structure will be responsible for dialogue , cooperation and consultation between these countries .
I welcome the report by Mrs Lalumière .
It is an exceptionally helpful document .
We need to improve our capacity for rapid and targeted action .
We need to step up our efforts of coordination .
That gives us a considerable agenda for the next few years .
I hope that we will have the support of Parliament in working through it .
We should build on existing competencies .
Saying ' no ' to institutional revolution does not mean turning our backs on innovation .
The Commission recently tabled a proposal for the creation of a rapid reaction facility .
Let me be clear about the Commission 's role .
The important thing is to recognise the relationship between the two .
We are helping to create border services in the Balkans .
We are spending money on de-mining in virtually every continent .
We had the Pleven plan .
We had de Gasperi .
We had Fouchet .
This time we have to make a difference .
Their plans are clear .
They stress that each country should decide separately on its involvement .
They believe that they have no obligation to become involved in enforcing peace .
These differences of opinion and interpretation must be taken into account .
It is also wise in security policy to establish differentiated integration .
Combined troops of the European Union should only be used for crisis management .
This means that we have imposed a few restrictions on ourselves .
Despite these restrictions , we are able to pass a sound verdict now , in my opinion .
Let me start by making a positive comment .
The Commissioner spent quite a long time talking about this and I think he had every reason to .
I would like to specify two .
One is the EU ' s say .
I would like to make one final point .
What is important is that the analysis and security policy are new .
This does not necessarily include more resources .
This majority confirms the quality of your work and the care which has gone into it .
But it also confirms how weak the critical voices have become .
I do not see this is a cause for celebration .
Even official threat analyses confirm that there is no military threat to the countries of western Europe .
War , if anything , is the most unsuitable and most counter-productive method in this respect .
Military is what the USA does best .
Secondly : we reject a European military block formation .
I think it is a fairly typical figure .
It represents - and let me say this very slowly - 0.00029 % of military spending .
I fear that this policy first creates crises which it then endeavours to control .
Which is why there is nothing left for us but to say a firm No .
Such an approach would lead to failure .
Its lack of transparency is characterised by a multitude of initiatives and ever changing coalitions .
I would nonetheless like to try to make a few observations .
First of all , I wonder whether the creation of a European identity is backed by sound motives .
I would like to stress that we should not be guided by power motives .
It is not about power , but about taking responsibility .
We need plain agreements on competencies in this field .
And as far as we are concerned , these are still mainly within the national state .
The balance between the institutions should not be altered in the case of such an important question .
Our project is based , or should be based , fundamentally on a community of values .
Mr President , last month we celebrated Europe Day .
Central to this was Robert Schuman ' s speech of 9 May 1950 .
Seen in a global perspective , security is clearly indivisible .
We share the same planet and the same fate .
We are , of course , loyal to the decisions taken in Helsinki .
Such ambitions are pure fantasy and mere tilting at windmills .
A policy on conflict prevention is missing from our arsenal .
What is the distribution of labour between the EU and NATO to look like ?
We must develop complementary , and not duplicate , structures .
How will it be possible to guarantee the influence of the non-aligned States upon expanding security policy ?
One more point : the importance of Parliament .
Its position must be strengthened and this point needs to be entered on the agenda for Feira .
It is about intervention .
Some might even go so far as to say that attacks may actually be mounted one of these days .
After all , the European Union cannot escape its responsibility which is commensurate with its economic and cultural stature .
Mr President , we have emphasised the civil and military aspects of this policy in our resolutions .
It would therefore be dangerous if this policy were not entirely supervised by us .
Obviously not .
In fact , we are very keen for our security to be undivided .
We do not want this .
Thank you , Catherine Lalumière .
The war in and about Kosovo has made Europeans realise three important things .
First , that we need to give ourselves conflict prevention capabilities .
If we want to avoid war , we need to give ourselves this capability .
There can be no artificial divide between humanitarian aid and military action .
The idea of a joint European and national Assembly has not been sufficiently developed by a long chalk .
Will it need to be more than an informal conversation club ?
Will it be given competencies at the expense of national parliaments ?
European unification is born from a desire for sustainable peace .
This is a leading concept which recurs in many interventions .
This peace is communal and it should also be maintained communally .
I want to address a word to people in London .
To London I say : you cannot do that ; be realistic !
Please face reality .
This is a valuable new development in which we are involved and which we are debating .
We must try to shape it positively .
Cologne and Helsinki have added substance to the common European security and defence policy .
The aim is to develop our own capacity in order to be able to implement the so-called Petersberg tasks .
A decision has been made on the extent of the troops required in this respect .
A draft of the necessary decision-making mechanisms is in place .
A small-scale NATO is emerging .
The European Union must be able to act autonomously .
This may sound obvious , but this statement also touches upon an enormous problem .
What does autonomous mean in relation to NATO ?
Is action within a NATO context always the first option , as the Americans claim ?
The second point is about democratic control .
This mainly relates to the government .
Here too , the pertinent question arises as to whether the Council pays any attention to this at all ?
Operating at an informal level has its advantages but not if issues of war or peace are involved .
The government conference can benefit from this .
The last speaker said that a small-scale NATO is emerging .
We need to address that .
I should like to confine myself to the question of democratic and parliamentary control of this policy .
Peace and security are not suitable subjects for Council meetings in camera .
They must be subject to parliamentary control .
It is important for decisions on military intervention to remain the responsibility of national parliaments .
This European security and defence policy must be subject to parliamentary monitoring in this House .
The President-in-Office has said that transparency and clarity are needed .
I am reminded of the policy of the Christmas goose trying to postpone Christmas .
It is a remarkable achievement .
That , as we are already seeing , will drive forward the agenda very rapidly .
We need a strong , competitive European defence industry .
We still rely heavily on intergovernmental activity .
The Commission has a crucial role in this .
This Commission has been completely silent on this issue .
Kosovo has been mentioned several times today .
In fact , four issues are at stake .
Thirdly , the facility for rapid , targeted intervention .
But we should try for institutional revolution .
This is somewhat disingenuous .
But this apparently is not enough .
The real desire is to create something separate from NATO .
There is a psychological explanation for this .
On the contrary , a Europe with its own military initiative will take its NATO obligations more seriously .
We cannot build up an expensive parallel structure .
I should like to congratulate Mrs Lalumière because she has taken a huge step forward in her report .
The problem with a European foreign policy is not quantitative .
There is no problem with the figures .
It is qualitative .
An enormous amount of valuable property has been destroyed .
I am extremely pleased that this process is going on .
This concept is based upon individual Member States ' fulfilling the commitments they have made .
I have previously discussed the shrinking defence budgets of the Member States .
The choices seem clear , the objective is challenging and its achievement will be decisive .
The commitment of the Member States is essential .
The current challenges cannot be deferred or hesitated over .
I congratulate Mrs Lalumière on her work .
We too share these concerns .
Mr President , it has been an interesting debate .
We have heard plenty of good sense in the course of it , as one would anticipate .
I shall be mercifully brief .
I do not want to come between Parliament and its preprandial democratic duty .
However , there are a couple of points I should like to make .
We need our own crisis units in the Commission , but we should keep that small .
I am bound to say that is one of my obsessions .
We brought forward a new regulation for speeding up our delivery of assistance to the Balkans .
We have made proposals for cleaning up the Danube .
Those are all areas where we have brought forward proposals .
I hope we can get quick decisions .
Once again I thank the honourable Member for her superb report .
I can only imagine the amount of work that went into it .
All of us know the amount of wisdom that went into it as well .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon .
We now look forward to the strengthening of our cooperation with Australia .
I wish you all a successful and an enjoyable stay here in Strasbourg .
Mr Perry has the floor on a point of order .
Is this allowed under our Rules ?
There is no president of Canada .
Calendar of part-sessions of Parliament for the year 2001
Dell ' Alba ( TDI ) .
These amendments have been deemed to be inadmissible .
I dispute the statement that these amendments , supported by many of my fellow Members , are inadmissible .
There is therefore some confusion as to what we are voting on .
That is why we did not feel that we could deem these amendments to be acceptable .
( Parliament adopted the calendar of part-sessions as amended )
Simplified procedure - without report
( Parliament approved the initiative )
( Parliament approved the Commission proposal )
( The President approved the common position )
Is there a speaker in favour of this request and one against ?
Everything is in place for a vote to be held .
( Parliament rejected the request to postpone the vote )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Applause )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted both legislative resolutions in successive votes )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Please have the legal implications checked as a matter of urgency .
That cannot be the purpose of the compromise .
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Parliament ' s calendar of part-sessions - 2001
This is because Parliament ' s work is not being organised properly .
( The President cut the speaker off )
I would like to add something further .
It undermines Parliament 's credibility and political impact .
This Parliament must restructure its mode of operation to reflect the changed working conditions .
Beysen recommendation ( A5-0153 / 2000 )
This seems to me to be excessive bureaucracy as well as an unnecessary amount of work for Parliament .
But to what end ?
We must make life simpler for our citizens and simplify our legislation as well !
Maaten Report ( A5-0156 / 2000 )
But when , in the past , have we ever succeeded in reducing tobacco consumption or cigarette smoking ?
Only once , Mr President .
' And when was that ? ' you may ask .
All cigarettes are harmful .
None do any good .
No man is an island .
All human beings are involved with each other .
But we are responsible for the health of our citizens and we must decide on rules here .
Other regions must decide on their own regulations .
Mr President , I share this explanation of vote with Mrs Cauquil and Mrs Bordes .
This dilemma must be resolved in the interests of the credibility of Community policy .
The European Union must set itself the task of pursuing policies which our citizens can understand .
Protecting public health is effectively our responsibility .
Public health is not just any old interest , it is of general interest .
More than half a million people died as a result of tobacco addiction in the EU in 1990 .
I welcome the commitment to increase information in cigarette labelling .
Health warnings will take up 40 % of the front of the packet and 50 % of the back .
Each individual brand should list all additives , not just the prohibited ingredients .
People have a right to accurate information on the health risks of tobacco .
The Greens want to ban many of the more than 600 additives in cigarettes .
We need to know what these substances are and make sure that they are properly tested .
Smokers have a right to know exactly what a cigarette contains .
- ( PT ) The debate and vote on this report revealed a clear divide between Members .
I also want the different restrictions to be based on scientific facts .
This proposal to change the timetable is also very important from the public health point of view .
Unfortunately my proposal was not adopted .
However , I am not trying here to come to terms with the past .
Snuff is addictive .
The question of tobacco growing subsidy has not been addressed in this report .
One smoker in two will die , sooner or later , from a smoking-related disease .
These figures speak for themselves and are terrifying .
Tobacco is not just like any other product .
Our society has the duty , in certain areas , to set strict moral limits .
It is the whole issue of human behaviour that is at stake here .
I voted in the strongest possible terms against Amendment No 54 .
This factor alone is sufficient reason for us to grasp this problem with both hands .
Moreover , we wish to abolish the peculiar tobacco derogation granted to Greece .
Smoking kills and there is no nice way to put that .
I am disappointed it was not accepted .
It is preposterous that tobacco companies are trying to destroy this legislation .
I am fed up with them trying to put a stop to these proposals .
They have misled people for far too long .
At present , warnings are cleverly hidden by displays or coloured packaging .
Smokers or those considering smoking must know the full risks of their choice .
This is simply not true .
Low tar cigarettes cause just as much damage as normal cigarettes .
This legislation will spell out the dangers of smoking and save thousands of lives .
But the jobs will be lost here .
The EU has absolutely no powers to enforce such a ban .
It has nothing to do with the internal single market .
That is presumptuous and offends the customs and practices of other countries .
Unilateral action by the EU will be pointless .
Berenguer Fuster report ( A5-0142 / 2000 )
I feel that this directive should be extended to include this type of inspection .
Lulling report ( A5-0144 / 2000 )
For my part , I would like there to be a free market .
She also criticised the aim to restrict the importation of beer through derogation provisions .
In my opinion , the Commission ' s proposal is a rather good compromise , however .
Vidal-Quadras Roca report ( A5-0159 / 2000 )
And who was that ?
Maybe you can enlighten me , Mr President .
It is true that he rejected the proposal by the European Commission .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m. )
Special UN conference : Women 2000
That was an exceptionally useful piece of political coordination .
Collectively we fought hard to move forward from Beijing .
If we succeeded , it is due in part to the unity of purpose demonstrated by the various institutions .
And succeed , I think we can say , we certainly did !
We managed that without having to concede any watering down of the Beijing Platform in other areas .
The document reaffirms women 's rights as human rights .
It recognises that discrimination against women is often compounded by discrimination on other grounds .
The outcome document acknowledges the link between gender equality and greater prosperity .
Firstly , as a European Union , we should remain the driving force behind the Member States .
We also have a role to play vis-à-vis third countries .
It is the most atrocious form of violence perpetrated against women .
Finally , I would like to make it clear that I am a Catholic , but an open-minded Catholic .
That is most unusual , so here too special thanks .
And fruitful collaboration with non-governmental organisations also strengthened the position of the European Union .
The fight against violence was put on every country ' s agenda .
We want to have a parliamentarians ' conference in two years to review Beijing .
It is in our interest to fight for this .
But back to Europe .
This development merits particular attention from us in the European Parliament .
We should point out to the acceding countries that they need to improve this situation .
I would ask you to give attention to this .
They need to be involved in this process .
It is the very determined work of the European Union we have to thank for that .
Mr President , I should like to thank the Presidency .
I think that , happily enough , we can declare the Beijing platform for action a success .
I should also like to thank Mrs Smet .
Mr President , I want to thank the Council of Ministers and the Commission for their respective interventions .
The final document embodies progress in certain respects .
Nevertheless , it appears that the European Union approves of it .
Please answer me , Mr Patten .
Our work has been outstanding in this respect .
Mr Varaut , you are very badly informed . You have made a fool of yourself .
You were not in New York , but I was .
Your information is not accurate . It is not even true .
Your intervention is very unfortunate because it is false .
Poverty affects women more than anybody else .
This is greatly disappointing .
It is impossible to stop a revolution with clever word games and little schemes behind the scenes .
The fight goes on .
Mr President , on a point of order .
I want to put on record that I am not against women 's rights .
I have always supported women 's rights .
It must be an error .
Sometimes colleagues bring petitions from delegations and we sign them .
I am sorry about that .
That was not a point of order , Mr Khanbhai .
I really do not know what you are talking about .
Finally , I must say that the European Union has a decisive role to play in this issue .
I am extremely grateful to everyone for this .
Europe must continue to be the driving force in developments in this area .
We must take advantage of all these opportunities .
Therefore , in my opinion , we have already achieved what was asked of us .
Thank you , President of the Council . We all share this hope .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
The Commissioner was entitled to give a speech in the plenary session .
If Poland tells us that it is free ...
You were speaking about a point of order .
You have , of course , prompted Mr Varaut to ask to take the floor for personal reasons .
You are quite right , Mr President .
Mr Varaut , we cannot base our debates on corridor conversations .
The corridors are there specifically for private , informal conversations , not official debates .
Tunisia - Human rights - EU-Tunisia Agreement
And this is the moment to do so .
Why is Europe silent about human rights in Tunisia ?
Is it on account of the stability and economic progress which this holiday destination enjoys ?
Is it because of the political links with France or the European socialists ?
Or because it has adopted a constructive stance in the peace process in the Middle East ?
Or do we see Tunisia mainly as a bulwark against the rise of Islamic fundamentalism ?
At any rate , President Ali only has the religious fanatics in mind .
He seems to be obsessed by them .
Not only Muslim fundamentalists , but all political opponents are systematically silenced .
If the violations continue , the Treaty will unfortunately need to be suspended .
Would Commissioner Patten agree with me there ?
The European Union cannot allow one agreement partner that which it denies another .
They therefore asked for understanding and patience .
This is the area in which the European Union can and must cooperate .
We need true political will and the economic and human resources to put it into practice .
This is why we need to strengthen the interparliamentary dialogue and the dialogue with the representatives of civil society .
As we say in my country , By talking we come to understand people ' .
We do not work in this way .
A measured policy is , in our opinion , the best way to achieve these objectives .
It sparked a public debate in Tunisia on the human rights situation in that country .
The first , to which my colleague referred , is political dialogue .
I would like to explore this further with Tunisia .
I will keep Parliament informed of developments in all these areas .
The issues that we have been discussing this afternoon are extremely important .
I know that Parliament is aware of the whole picture .
Nevertheless , there are issues which give considerable cause for concern .
Parliament has legitimate concerns and a strongly felt point of view .
That can be expressed firmly but courteously , as Parliament is doing today .
Of course there will be events and developments that crowd in on us .
What is at the heart of the Union 's common foreign and security policy ?
It is the projection of stability .
That is the crucial element in our policy in the Mediterranean .
What are we trying to do there ?
But there is more than that , which I will come to in a moment .
That is what I would like to be judged on .
Free trade is not the end ; free trade is a means to an end .
I could not hope to emulate the crushing brevity of this , in my view , brilliant journalistic comment .
However , my question is practically the same . Why are we arguing about the situation in Tunisia ?
Believe me , I am sensitive to the question of human rights .
I have spent fifteen years of my life without a passport or driving licence .
Mr President , the paradoxes of this Parliament never cease to amaze us .
I would like to make two comments .
Based on Christian beliefs , we denounce this ultimate means of self-defence .
The present Tunisian regime does not tolerate any independent minds .
He goes on to say , " they might as well forget that these rights even exist . "
But what form will this dialogue take , Mr Patten ?
What practical and specific steps can we take ?
How can we make the positions that we adopt here effective ?
We can start by asking how things are going to develop in Tunisia .
Tunisia ' s rulers have two solutions today .
Mr President , human rights are being infringed .
This is something we know about .
It is also known about in Tunisia , both by the authorities and the people .
This is an extremely serious matter .
I think that the best way of levelling criticism is by means of dialogue .
Well then , I do not feel that the situation is so bad .
Tunisia is our neighbour , because the Mediterranean does not divide , it unites us .
These concerns , as expressed here today , are not born of a colonial or neo-colonial attitude .
We are not talking about unacceptable interference in the internal affairs of a third country .
It would therefore make no sense to cancel these agreements .
On the contrary , we must use them to shape this critical dialogue .
But how else is this fight best fought , if not through democracy ?
This is also being demonstrated by Tunisia ' s neighbours .
Which is why we cannot do without it .
Tunisia keeps saying that it is a question of economic and social development .
One last comment : we want to help Tunisia , about that there can be no doubt .
The Balkans are not our only priority .
But we must do that all together and sensitively .
I just want to touch on two other points he raised .
Thank you , Commissioner Patten .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
China 's accession to WTO
The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions :
In this regard , I would like to make a comment and two requests .
Those have been my comments . My two questions are as follows :
As I have said , Parliament supports this agreement .
However , the next speaker will probably know more about this than I do .
It is good news all round .
It will be a challenge for China and , in due course , for the WTO .
This is a good news story .
First , the question about Parliament 's assent .
However , at this stage these are just proposals .
Of course , it is the Council that decides on consultation with the European Parliament .
This is as far as the legal and the institutional answer goes .
The multilateral phase of China 's accession that takes place in Geneva has still to be finalised .
This is not expected to happen before the end of September at the earliest .
They are either in place or will be implemented soon .
We have to bear in mind that this will have some effects on the visibility of our European efforts .
There is no need to outline the specific successes in detail .
So the results are clear .
Permit me , therefore , to address just a few aspects .
Will it mark the beginning of a further opening of society ?
Will it mark the beginning of a new round in politics ?
Will it result in institutional reforms in China ?
And , of course , will there also be a further opening of the market ?
These are the really crucial and exciting questions which we face .
This is where we really will have to get down to brass tacks during further discussions with the Commission .
Human rights are a fundamental element of a modern society .
Mr President , I have two short minutes in which to make four points .
I hope the brevity of my congratulations does not diminish the warmth of them .
Secondly , a point addressed to the Council .
This simply cannot carry on .
I would plead for the internal territorial interests of Member States to be overcome on this particular point .
Thirdly , technical assistance .
We have a total budget for China of EUR 80 million .
Finally , human rights .
We should be all the more robust .
This person was complaining about the unemployment , insecurity and enormous widening of the gulf between the classes .
In fact , this Chinese person was so desperate that she said she wished Mao Tse Tung was back .
I am wondering now if the Commission has carried out any other analyses .
It would be extremely interesting to know .
Another matter is that of human rights .
A number of people here believe that human rights should benefit from China ' s accession to the WTO .
Yes , that is possible - I am no fortune-teller .
His assessment is that the WTO Agreement will not benefit human rights at all .
In what way is Wei Jingsheng mistaken ?
Now , what has happened since that abortive summit ?
Therefore , we have the right to ask a few questions .
I look forward to sharing that news with them in liberal and liquid fashion .
If this Parliament were part of that dialogue we might exert additional pressure for improvement in that field .
I hope the Commissioner will listen carefully to that suggestion .
So I beg to differ with Commissioner Patten .
There are many people in China for whom this agreement does not spell good news .
Powerful international agri-business knows that too .
That is why US grain companies like Cargill cannot believe their luck .
No wonder they are already gloating over bigger , better and more consistent markets .
Would he like to estimate what percentage of success the Chinese people will get from these same negotiations ?
Despite the giant leaps forward , many problems remain unresolved and questions left open with regard to world trade .
The debate is closed .
Clearly there is pressure on our agenda today .
This is an issue which is now entirely without contention .
Everybody supports this matter .
That would end pressure on the agenda right at the end of this evening .
Possibly we could have a vote on it now .
But we take very good note of this proposal .
Question Time ( Council )
The next item is Question Time ( B5-0487 / 2000 ) . We will examine questions to the Council .
Question No 1 by ( H-0434 / 00 ) :
( The President cut the speaker off )
These changes have also been made based on appropriations that remain unspent in certain areas .
It should enable us to work even more efficiently in the future in the European Union .
Do you believe that the concept of real stabilisation can be continued after 2006 ?
I am very happy to answer the honourable Member ' s question .
In practice this meant reducing the amounts established .
This is my personal view .
As the author is not present , Question No 2 lapses .
Question No 3 by ( H-0446 / 00 ) :
The Council would analyse this proposal with due care .
I know that the Portuguese presidency is very familiar with this issue .
My question pertains particularly to radioactive emissions .
I know France is part of the troika and will be taking up the presidency in July .
Is the Council aware of this study ?
Would it like more information about this study ?
Will it bring it to the attention of the French presidency ?
The Council needs to get its act together .
Therefore , any information which may be received in this respect by the Council will be welcome .
Question No 4 by ( H-0449 / 00 ) :
I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his reply .
Yesterday I tabled the same question to the European Commission .
I received its reply today .
I thank the President-in-Office , although I noticed that he contradicted himself in his reply .
On the other hand , however , he raises the question of compliance with the law .
Does the President-in-Office agree with this reply , if that is what he has in mind ?
Only the Commission would have the authority to act in this respect .
Therefore , at this stage , this issue does not have a Community dimension .
The President-in-Office ' s reply is correct .
Question No 5 by ( H-0450 / 00 ) :
The Council will then re-examine the situation .
Turkish troops have never before participated in exercises on Greek territory .
Obviously it sees it as an unnecessary luxury .
But that is a matter for the Greek government .
Mr President-in-Office , I should like to be a little more specific .
Turkey has disputed a number of issues in the Aegean at one time or another .
And one of these issues is the status of the grey zones or island rocks in the Aegean .
My question is quite specific .
What is the Council ' s opinion ; is this what it is calling on Turkey to do ?
Question No 6 by ( H-0451 / 00 ) :
Does the Council have any strategy for this sensitive region ?
The war in neighbouring Chechnya represents an additional threat to Georgia .
Thank you , Mr President-in-Office , for the information which you have given me .
Also , has the Council taken account of this possibility in its policy in the region ?
Question No 7 by ( H-0454 / 00 ) :
I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his reply .
It is perhaps the issue I have received more letters about in the last year than any other .
Mr President , I was in Egypt at exactly the time when these events took place .
Question No 8 by ( H-0457 / 00 ) :
These meetings are held monthly and before the formal meetings of Ecofin which involve all fifteen Member States .
This was the guidance given by the Luxembourg European Council of 12 and 13 December 1997 .
Mr President , I should like to thank the Presidency for its answer to my question .
If so , we will very probably see several models emerge .
How can we avoid this ?
It is as simple as that .
You will say that this is not part of the normal procedure .
There should be no doubt on this .
Question No 9 by ( H-0458 / 00 ) :
We do not feel that there has been any breakdown in the transparency for which the Council is responsible .
Up in the gallery , listening to you and me , are visitors .
Everything is open here in Parliament .
They can hear what we are discussing and agree or disagree .
But the Council of Ministers meets in secret .
Nevertheless these matters are done in secret .
This is something which we have been discussing in the Intergovernmental Conference .
Question No 10 by ( H-0460 / 00 ) :
Mr President , I will be very brief .
The Council has not examined the issue raised in the Member ' s question .
The Member States are responsible for assessing the specific projects to be financed by the World Bank .
We must find a measure which is appropriate for the reactions and the various situations .
Question No 11 by ( H-0462 / 00 ) :
Partnership with third countries also constitutes a key element in the success of this policy .
The Monitoring Centre for immigration is nothing more than a story in the press .
They are development measures which are within the spirit of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership .
Question No 12 by ( H-0466 / 00 ) :
It ought to be easy to answer yes or no to that question .
Mr Gahrton , the Petersberg tasks have several dimensions .
Some are purely humanitarian , for example rescue tasks .
But from what you have said , that is not the case .
It appears that governments in neutral countries have a tendency to mislead citizens .
Is that the case ?
In other areas a resolution will of course be necessary .
Therefore , they can decide on a case-by-case basis as they see fit .
This is the fundamental rule of the European Union for any situation requiring the participation of military forces .
It is only since then that these issues have been raised .
Question No 13 by ( H-0471 / 00 ) :
If so , is there not a case for tightening up the code of conduct ?
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , allow me to hide my amazement at your reply .
Question No 14 by ( H-0474 / 00 ) :
This is not a matter for the Council .
Thank you for agreeing to take the question .
I am certainly taken aback by the President-in-Office 's response .
The fact is that the sanctions were imposed by the Council .
How then can the Council continue to ignore the democratic decision of the Austrian people ?
Certainly , what is happening does not reflect the European aspiration to unity .
If any country has interpreted this attitude more extensively then this is a matter for each country .
I wanted to ask the President-in-Office to clarify something .
So has there not been any consultation within the Council at any time ?
It is nonetheless being mooted that the sanctions will be brought up again in Feira .
Do you yourself not think that this is a little peculiar ?
This should be a Europe of unity and solidarity .
Someone must take an initiative to resolve this serious problem .
It has given stature to an individual who does not deserve that stature .
In fact it has strengthened his position , not weakened it .
You should realise that there is actually something strange in the Austrian internal situation .
What has changed in the Austrian situation which could lead us to change our attitude ?
Only time ?
Why systematically place the onus on the 14 countries ?
Why must the 14 Member States change ?
What has happened in Austria to justify this change ?
Thank you very much , Mr Seixas da Costa .
May you achieve much for Europe !
That concludes Questions to the Council .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.35 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. ) .
Change to the agenda
I therefore propose that they be included in accordance with the procedure without debate .
Is there any objection to the proposal ?
( Parliament gave its assent )
Reconstruction of Central America
I would like to highlight four issues .
The first relates to our assumption of responsibility in the event of these catastrophes .
Furthermore , our model of unequal development leads to poverty and indebtedness in these countries .
The second issue involves the global objective of our assistance .
This requires a substantial increase in our staff , a measure which this House supports .
In this respect , two facts worry us .
The European Parliament therefore requests a significant increase .
We therefore insist that this is a crucial and key point .
This process was a success .
We therefore welcome the Commission ' s proposal .
The Commission report predates the Kosovo conflict and we have made no changes to it .
We stand by the sum proposed for Central America .
I think that is the most important signal we can send out today .
Mr President , our committee undoubtedly agrees with Mr Marset Campos ' s report .
International aid must , without fail , be well coordinated .
The Commission , for its part , must set up suitable structures on the ground .
The same applies when it comes to involving the people affected , especially the indigenous population .
We all know that full well .
The countries most affected , Honduras and Nicaragua , are the poorest in the region .
I remember the date : November 18-19 1998 .
To transfer this responsibility to the budgetary authority is not correct .
The Commission must at all times ensure the appropriate allocation of resources in accordance with the priorities agreed .
This resolution has the advantage of going beyond emergencies .
The funds appropriated are not sufficient and the staffing is certainly inadequate .
However , I would like to stress certain things that he has said .
First : we must help with reconstruction in these countries .
Perhaps Commission staff could be reassigned .
I cannot see why Nicaragua and Honduras still fail to qualify for the same treatment .
I do not want to quote the perennial example of bananas - the report does that .
I support this passage and also what Mr Kreissl-Dörfler has said .
I would like to quote the example of sugar .
It might help if we were to facilitate its access to the European markets .
The third challenge is that we need to fight the causes of these disasters .
However , there are many scientists who assume that it probably did .
We just cannot say for certain .
There really is a link and I should like to draw your attention to it .
I only wish there were not .
In the final analysis , of course , this is up to the people of Central America .
The third point I should like to make concerns the implementation of this aid .
Finally , I should like to point out that the hurricane in October 1998 went beyond Central America .
It is now June 2000 .
I consider that to be far too long .
The programme is based on the principle of sustainable development , as has been underlined by several speakers .
A coordination group is being set up between the Commission and the Member States .
Another important element will be the Stockholm Follow-up Group .
These problems have now been overcome .
The first official will arrive in Managua on 17 July and the remaining officials in the following weeks .
No further delays are expected at this point .
I quite understand the arguments Mr Salafranca raised about human resources .
As you know , it is not a question specific to this debate .
Additional measures have been adopted by the Commission in the framework of the Community Action Plan .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.
That the Treaty of Amsterdam moved in this direction was therefore all the more important .
That is precisely what happens when you make compromises and try to find a consensus .
You are satisfied on many points , but not always 100 % .
This means training officials in charge of processing applications to a high standard .
These officials must have access to cross-border information .
This includes welfare , accommodation etc .
I know that some people are critical of this .
One country alone should not have to bear the burden .
We have discussed extremely constructively and fairly with each other .
He speaks from the heart .
Common principles were indeed seen as more important than individual political objectives .
I think that we shall have a highly constructive vote in favour of our common ideal tomorrow .
The first is the question of how to divide the burden and has already been addressed .
If you look at refugee movements , you will see that they always affect the same countries .
It is on a par with Luxembourg , Belgium and the Netherlands .
Others have a much lighter burden to bear and greater solidarity between the Member States is needed here .
It will help enormously if we manage to draw up these lists .
I call on them to consider withdrawing these proposed amendments so that the broad consensus can be maintained .
Assert yourself in your party .
I guarantee that you will have the support of the German Social Democrats , if no-one else .
I am not judging that .
But here we are talking about the procedural , not the substantive right to asylum .
That is something else entirely .
The Greens ' proposed amendments contain a discussion of the content , not the form of asylum law .
That is a huge step forward for us .
I shall soon be devoting myself to different tasks in my group .
It is unfortunate , but we wish you all the best in your new job .
This was the fun part of what I wanted to say .
What shape is the European asylum policy in ?
That is hard to say , as there is not really a European asylum policy to speak of .
The previous European Commission may have had the will , but did not have any power .
Most governments showed willing too , but they were subject to the rule of unanimity .
Then there was the Tampere Summit .
Dozens of proposals were submitted there , also in this area of policy .
Things were looking up , according to many journalists .
It is unlikely that a scoreboard will be able to unlock this paralysis within policy .
What needs to happen now ?
All sorts of things need to happen .
We will be voting in favour of the tenor of the report and we are backing it .
Mr Pirker , I do not see a problem with this - you can reject them again tomorrow .
One way or another , we shall be voting in favour of Mr Schmitt ' s report .
Tempus fugit !
We must implement the Treaty of Amsterdam by the end of 2004 .
There are difficulties at hand though .
The national states are often not prepared as yet to support European rules .
But this should not divert us from our purpose .
I hope that we will be able to persuade the Member States of the merits of our approach .
The EU is the region ' s superpower - economically , politically and militarily .
It is not just a question of passivity and sins of omission .
No , for these are the EU ' s very rationale .
It is not a question of our being obliged to guarantee legal rights to our fellow human beings .
It is problem of method .
The other amendment which I have signed concerns the distribution of burdens .
We are also concerned here about the independence of asylum seekers and about social realities .
Mr Schulz has reproached us Greens on the same count .
That also forms part of the legal framework .
We have made a start , a good start and must progress hand in hand .
I shall be pleased if we progress by so much as a millimetre .
A cost-sharing policy must also be established .
Solidarity must be for all .
I hope that the next four years will be better and more fruitful for all of us .
Who is going to help me ? I would be willing to help and even accommodate asylum seekers . "
The sense of consensus is to be welcomed .
It is a deeply disturbing phenomenon in my own country .
We need clear implementation of good , humane laws and we will all benefit from them .
I thank Parliament for the support that has been expressed for this communication .
I especially congratulate the two rapporteurs , Mr Schmitt and Mrs Echerer , for their excellent reports .
I would ask you to convey my good wishes to Mr Schulz , who is no longer here .
It is my intention to present this proposal for a directive in the autumn of 2000 .
But the decision of the European Council in Tampere was to endorse an approach based on minimum common standards .
The Commission welcomes the approach the European Parliament has taken in many parts of the motion for a resolution .
The resolution calls for temporary protection within three years .
We have already sent such a proposal for consultation with the European Parliament .
It is my intention that by the end of the year 2000 this communication will be brought forward .
I sincerely feel encouraged by the fact that this communication has such broad support in the House .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Crime victims in the EU
Why is this so necessary ?
There is a need for clarity concerning the rights of victims and for transparency concerning their status .
It is regrettable , however , that the unanimity rule currently applies .
We cannot let victims wait for that long .
After all , treating victims with understanding and dignity also plays a preventive role .
The proper treatment of victims will help destigmatise them and enhance their emblematic role .
In particular , additional measures are required for minors .
Victims should also be informed of the availability of the various forms of assistance .
It is extremely important that , depending on the nature of the crime , specialist assistance is provided .
Member States should be obliged to set up special police units for crime victims .
An initiative of this kind is a first step towards crime prevention .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report .
It is an important area and she has rightly drawn attention to it .
It is therefore crucial that we use these powers to improve the position of victims of crime .
As the rapporteur has said , they do not need to become victims again .
Nor do they need to feel that they are being branded almost as criminals themselves .
We must in particular draw attention to intrusion or possible intrusion by the press .
Those who perhaps are in fear of authority are especially vulnerable .
The PSE Group is pleased to support this report and to congratulate the rapporteur .
I congratulate the rapporteur on her work .
Let me give just one brief example from my own constituency .
Mr Pike , a lorry driver in my constituency , was recently assaulted by his employer in the Netherlands .
Mr Pike is not a wealthy man and the cost of legal redress is high .
He does not have access to legal aid in the Netherlands .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her valuable work .
The Commission has tackled a very important issue in its communiqué .
The situation is in untenable conflict with EU principles of the rule of law .
People have to enjoy true justice without having to pay for it .
The added value of Europol in this process must also be investigated carefully .
I also urge it be ambitious .
However , I would like to highlight the importance of this report and Mrs Sörensen ' s cooperation .
This is especially true in the case of terrorism .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow , at 12 noon .
Late payment in commercial transactions
However , I am at a disadvantage .
Apparently some 450,000 jobs are lost in the EU every year as a result .
We often spend a great deal of money on very few jobs .
Allow me to close with one more comment regarding the Commission .
It is a bitter pill to swallow .
I would also like to thank the Commission for its cooperation , which has been as constructive as ever .
It is regulating what should be regulated .
Nothing more , nothing less .
Again , nothing more , nothing less . And it is regulating matters in a legally well-organised way .
We have now provided the framework ; all that is left now is the transposition .
The Member States have been given two years to do this in .
I have another question for the Commission .
A good day ' s work deserves a good day ' s pay .
But some have had to wait for it longer than others .
The stronger the partner , the more power he has to make a business wait .
We know that some 450,000 jobs are lost every year as the result of late payments .
I am proud of the fact that the European Parliament is making such an important contribution to this .
It is a sensational result .
I am proud to be a member of this Parliament .
I believe that this is a magnificent definition .
I believe that it will have significant repercussions , which have been listed by previous speakers .
Consequently , public expenditure will also be reduced .
I think that this aspect cannot be stressed enough .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
( The sitting was closed at 11.30 p.m. )
Mr Pelinka was member of the committee of the European Observatory for Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna .
I was there when she gave her speech in Vienna to mark the opening of the Observatory .
We are also responsible for the functioning of the European institutions .
Thank you , Mrs Buitenweg .
We are investigating the matter you have just told us about very carefully .
You subsequently issued a press release in which you expressed your regret about this .
You have , of course , every right to do so .
Everyone has their own personal and political responsibility .
I was speaking personally .
I do not think I abused my position .
On Tuesday afternoon , I went to Poland to take part in an international conference .
In order to convince the police and improve the situation I produced my European Parliament pass .
Mr Mauro , what happened to you is totally unacceptable .
It really is absolutely unacceptable .
We will try to put an end to it .
We make virtually no use of it at all .
It clearly states in the pass that it is only valid within the European Union .
Mrs Pack is quite right .
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
But I was making a serious point and maybe yesterday it was taken rather too lightheartedly .
( Parliament approved the Minutes )
European Council of 19 / 20 June 2000
The next item is the joint debate on the :
Lunch will be devoted to the Intergovernmental Conference and , in particular , closer cooperation .
Yesterday , in the General Affairs Council , these documents were voted on and approved .
A report will be presented on the progress made on the tax issue .
We therefore have a series of important items on our external policy agenda .
The presidency has already drawn up and submitted the report on the Intergovernmental Conference .
In our questions , we referred to Mr Fischer ' s speech .
We await the responses with confidence .
I would like to mention three of the priorities the Commission is seeking to highlight at the European Council .
So the first priority is genuine institutional reform right now , driven forward by the Portuguese Presidency .
That is a crucial point for us as well .
So that reform is also the obligatory route for all future evolution in the construction of Europe .
Mr Napolitano mentioned the report on governance announced by President Prodi .
That is a second point .
The Charter of Fundamental Rights Mr Gama mentioned is a political challenge for all of us .
The political dimension of the European Union is also involved .
First I want to talk about the enlargement .
During the Portuguese Presidency the negotiations with the Luxembourg Group entered their final chapters .
We too have to prepare , by reforming the institutions , and there is a long way to go .
We should debate the advantages and the changes involved in it with them .
The Commission is contributing actively to these developments , in particular as regards civilian crisis management .
Coherence is absolutely essential and the institutions must work together on this .
The Council should also adopt the common strategy for the Mediterranean region .
The Commission has already sent a mission to evaluate reconstruction needs in situ .
Since then , the European economy has shown continuous improvement .
Progress has already been made .
We have presented proposals on government contracts , postal services and enterprise policy .
I also want to stress the major role played by this House in all these issues .
We trust the Feira European Council will acknowledge all the progress made .
There again , perhaps Feira can point us in that direction .
Finally , the fiscal package .
As you know , the Council has not reached agreement , but discussions continue .
Ladies and gentlemen , a European Council is a result achieved by a presidency .
But a European Council is also the result of the effort made by each institution .
Thank you , Mr Barnier .
Mr Klaus Hänsch has asked to move a procedural motion .
Is this by any chance the Commission ' s special contribution to the development of the new technologies ?
I therefore hope that this will be a meaningful working summit .
That is the first challenge .
The peoples of Central Europe are anxious to join our Community of values .
To achieve this , we and those countries need to fulfil our respective obligations .
You have talked about extending the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference .
I would like to offer you my emphatic support - be flexible !
Commissioner Barnier has talked about majority voting .
We need both majority voting and enhanced cooperation !
Commissioner Barnier talked about a basic treaty .
We must have more respect for the principles of subsidiarity .
The Commissioner also spoke about the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
I would like to add one more thought .
I should have mentioned it just now , but I forgot .
Why do we need a flexible approach to the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference ?
This is about paragraph 8 of the political groups ' motion for a resolution .
I therefore urge you to make this your business .
And I also entreat you to take the position of the European Parliament into consideration at the IGC .
But we nevertheless hope you will succeed .
It is completely contradictory to have citizenship without rights .
It is therefore absolutely essential that the Charter of Fundamental Rights be incorporated into the Treaty .
It is a formula for the future and I believe we should take it very seriously .
In this regard , I will add two decisive points .
That is an absolutely decisive point for the coming months .
Finally , I would like to say a few words about the Middle East .
It will stand the test of time as a testament to the work of this presidency .
You have remarked , Mr President-in-Office , that enlargement is the historic challenge .
We in my group very much believe that .
I cite qualified majority voting as an example .
We believe that the Monnet method has served the Union rather well .
We would certainly wish to reflect on any attempt to radically change it .
I should like to briefly mention the question of Austria .
We are not prescriptive in the manner of achieving this .
I add one footnote , but an important point of principle .
That is intolerable .
Regardless of intergovernmental diplomacy , it is intolerable that we should isolate the common citizens of a state .
In our opinion , this is very welcome .
I would like to say that the Mediterranean strategy is a very important one .
I also warmly welcome the concrete action programme concerning the northern dimension .
I do not say that as an accusation against the Portuguese Presidency .
I think it is up to all the Member States to take up the challenge .
What does the political authority , the Council , think of this laissez-faire philosophy ?
I think that is the best favour Europe can be done today .
This decision did not respect the sovereign choice of the Austrian people and has also been ineffective .
The second issue is the Intergovernmental Conference .
The third issue is the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Its content is not in question .
We hope that the Feira summit can come to the obvious conclusion .
The fourth and final issue is enlargement .
Perhaps we should launch a plan for a transatlantic football cup in Feira .
It is perhaps our only chance of beating the United States .
Then Europe could be some use for once .
They will create a State within the State and make decisions on behalf of everyone else .
The common market could also , of course , be opened up to all European countries .
Otherwise , cooperation must take place elsewhere .
My group rejects majority decision-making on enhanced cooperation .
Since then , things have largely returned to the normal routine .
The programme we have heard today does not give us cause for any great hope .
He must rectify what could have been avoided .
The longer it takes to resolve this issue , the more difficult it will become to resolve .
The second point of the triangle is social and economic cohesion .
We all knew that this IGC would be reduced in size and even minimalist .
Mr President , the drafting of the Charter has now reached a critical phase .
We have drafted 60 clauses and provoked 1000 amendments .
We have so far tried to reach a consensus across the body .
This is now proving an improbable task .
We require a far more formal decision-making procedure of a parliamentary type .
This prejudice must be suppressed by the Feira Council if the project is to succeed .
This reality is not sufficiently recognised in the texts before us , if at all .
In fact , this would mean a democratic U-turn which they do not seem to be prepared to make .
Certainly , we expected more from this first stage of the Intergovernmental Conference .
From the point of view of the institutions , the current impasse is certainly extremely serious .
The warning signs are starting to become apparent in the paralysis which has affected us in recent months .
The Union train thunders off , taking no account of the terrain .
We have no confidence in the Union project .
These have been lively months internationally .
I will now focus purely on the Middle East .
Some major issues have appeared on the scene since the conference was launched .
They are essential , but they must not disrupt the conference agenda .
We will debate those issues whatever happens .
But these are two parallel exercises .
It is not a case of one or the other , we need both .
How are we going to organise democratic control of these ' enhanced cooperations ' ?
I am thinking , of course , about the status of political parties .
I am also thinking about the reform of Article 7 .
Many of my colleagues say the Charter must be incorporated into the Treaty .
Yes , but what use will it be to incorporate a Charter if the content is disappointing ?
First we must work on the content .
That is our main task .
The Feira Council will be a major Council if it is ambitious enough .
Thank you again , Portuguese Presidency .
However , I would like to encourage you to do certain things in Feira .
We need to achieve efficiency and legitimacy , that is very important .
An attempt must be made to make the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding .
Progress should at least be made with streamlining the treaties and demarcating competences .
Needless to say , we are addressing you personally in your role of Portuguese Presidency .
My group chairman has made reference to the situation in Denmark , namely the euro referendum .
Let us also look at the possible consequences if your efforts were not to lead to solutions .
I would also call on the Portuguese Presidency to find a solution to this .
I wish to present my message clearly and to a purpose .
It is : let us attend first - and also -to the basic and important matters .
The institutional questions of the Intergovernmental Conference are enormously important , but they do not reach the people .
I believe that the Charter of Fundamental Rights does reach the people .
I congratulate the quality of the interventions of which the Presidency will take due note as it should .
We must be aware that the whole Conference is set out according to the decisions taken in Amsterdam .
The enlargement of the EU will be broadly consolidated at the European Council .
All these points are extremely important .
I must also say something on the Austria issue .
This has been a constant concern .
This must be borne in mind .
Thank you , Minister .
I wish you and your government a successful conclusion to the Portuguese Presidency .
Mr Cox , I think that , with your words , you are indeed voicing the feelings of many .
The Commission will shoulder its responsibilities .
It will take the initiative .
I would like to say a word on Croatia to Mr Barón Crespo .
You are right to highlight the strategic nature of the country , formerly part of Yugoslavia .
Mr President , the Commission is doing its duty and shouldering its responsibilities .
This is particularly true when it is faithful to the guidelines and decisions of a European Council .
That is what we are doing after Lisbon .
Mr Fischer and others have provided oxygen , a horizon .
But please , let us respect all the stages and work through them one by one .
I am not just saying complete them .
I am talking about success .
Success in Nice .
And , as far as I am concerned , the quality of reform is more important than the timetable .
Concluding successfully is more than simply concluding .
Many thanks , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today .
Mr President , I failed to catch the President 's eye this morning .
There has been a whole decade of dictatorship in that country .
Next Monday , Aung San Suu Kyi will be 55 years old .
It is a very poignant birthday for her .
In March , her husband died of cancer .
He asked for permission to visit her to say goodbye to his dear wife .
The military junta in Burma refused permission for him to see her .
She and the people of Burma will not give up .
What I am asking today is for the European Parliament to do what she asks .
She says : " Please use your liberty to support ours " .
Mrs Kinnock , I thank you for your words .
I think that you have spoken on behalf of many .
I now give the floor to Mr Lechner on a point of order .
( Applause )
Ladies and gentlemen , we will not re-open the debate on this .
We discussed and concluded this matter yesterday .
I think that congratulations are in order for Mr Lechner .
I am therefore completely satisfied with the vote as it was held yesterday .
Good , we have taken note of this .
This is a serious political and translation error .
I have consulted the services involved .
They will take note of this and will make the necessary corrections .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
With regard to paragraph 38 :
Mr President , there is a small translation problem in paragraph 38 .
The word ' organe ' has been correctly used in the French version .
My knowledge of the other languages is insufficient .
But I wanted to highlight that point so that the various language versions can be corrected .
Thank you , Mrs McCarthy .
I have taken due note of this .
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Murphy Report ( A5-0154 / 2000 )
There are delays in pension payments in all 15 of the Member States .
The national regulations aimed at managing this problem differ considerably from one Member State to another .
That is the purpose of the directive we are debating today .
The negotiations on this text were difficult .
A common position was finally adopted on 29 May last .
The European Parliament emerged from those long negotiations victorious on several crucial points .
I have therefore voted in favour of this text .
It is to them that I wish to explain my actions .
That was before the last European elections .
In other words , we have a new Parliament installed by a new electorate .
But despite that , the directive goes on .
This shows the change of Parliament was cosmetic - a charade .
All the electorate has been allowed to do is shuffle the deck chairs on the deck of the Titanic .
Meanwhile , the project continues to sink into the bureaucratic bog .
Late payment often suffocates many credible businesses , particularly small and medium-sized companies .
This measure , however , will help allow small businesses to fight back .
The Labour Government is determined to make the Single Market work for British business .
Maaten Report ( A5-0160 / 2000 )
I voted against this measure .
More duty .
This will be good for the balance sheet " .
I do not think so ! I therefore voted against the motion .
It is time the Government realised this .
Meeting of the European Council in Feira ( RC B5-0522 / 2000 )
This is not the best way to improve our relations .
Parliament has spoken very clearly .
Yesterday we gave a practical demonstration of our position by abolishing the Friday sittings .
That is what we said and that is why we voted in favour of it .
Thank you for your reaction .
I regret that the topic of subsidiarity is substantially missing from the Feira resolution .
On that account I did not vote for it .
There are left-wing forces which wish to introduce social objectives into the Treaty .
Mr President , I am speaking briefly to justify my abstention .
That is why I felt I had to abstain .
Unfortunately , the right wing has introduced a paragraph concerning Austria into this resolution .
It is now more than ever essential to fight fascists , neo-fascists and their accomplices .
The very future of Europe is at stake .
Hence my militant abstention on this text !
Shame on the sorcerer ' s apprentices !
This is unacceptable to us .
Since then little has changed .
It is too soon now to allow Austria fully back into the European fold .
. ( EL ) Workers cannot and must not be under any illusions here .
As always , the Communist Party of Greece will be standing firmly by their side .
We have not , therefore , been able to vote for these sections , viewed in isolation .
It is a question of the right opportunity and time for this political change to occur .
After all , what has changed in Austria ?
Has the government fallen ?
It is our belief that it would be more effective to advance the status of the European Companies Statute .
- ( SV ) I have voted against the resolution for the following reasons :
The resolution does not emphasise that enlargement must be given absolute priority .
Security and defence policy ( B5-0505 / 2000 )
For example , the French army was used for the colonial wars : Madagascar , Indo-China , Algeria .
The other former colonial powers of Europe have done the same in the same situation .
After the terrible events over the last century none of us wants military conflicts .
Nevertheless , the crisis in the Balkans has demonstrated the shortcomings of the European Union .
The Treaty of Amsterdam made the Petersberg tasks the responsibility of the Union .
That leaves Article 5 .
That will not happen without a radical break from neo-liberalism .
There is no need to increase the overall European defence budgets .
I find this duplicated work peculiar and difficult to understand .
The European Union possesses political , economic and diplomatic resources for this purpose .
It is not enough just to follow the principles of the United Nations ' Charter .
I cannot , therefore , support the resolution .
" Women 2000 " ( RC B5-0562 / 2000 )
As co-signatory to that resolution , Mrs Lulling made the following statement in Strasbourg :
Although we are not euphoric , the results of the Assembly are acceptable .
But the Treaty of Amsterdam does not oblige Poland to legislate on abortion .
It can be recommended to do so , but subsidiarity applies .
- There will always be differing opinions , this is the essence and vitality of democracy .
The more sensitive the issue , the greater sensitivity must be shown in dealing with it .
I will therefore abstain from voting on this resolution .
We have just celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Robert Schuman Declaration , the father of Europe .
Consensus should be our motif , not imposition or intimidation .
( The sitting was suspended at 2.05 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m. )
I thank the Members for their important communication .
Naturally , those responsible will be brought to account .
Structural Funds ( 1998 )
We strongly urge the Member States to ensure that this principle is strictly upheld .
This is not an easy problem , and it is not a new one either .
The report with which we are concerned is , of course , retrospective to 1998 .
Many positive changes have taken place since that time , not least since the new Commission took over .
All too often that is what has happened in the past .
Failure to act will result in the particular problems highlighted in this report .
The many amendments made by Members of this House have substantially enhanced the report .
I do not want to repeat here those criticisms which have been recorded and can be checked in writing .
Mr Turco and others Members have already reiterated these criticisms .
The 11th Annual Report should , therefore , at the same time include a progress report .
Nevertheless , there is a yawning gap between rhetoric and reality .
The forthcoming enlargement will add to this problem .
So as I see it , we need a new definition of additionality .
In this way our structural policy itself will contribute to regionalisation .
Structural policy simultaneously reacts to and creates regional structures .
The previous speaker mentioned this problem .
Benchmarking should also be possible in this policy area soon .
This looks pretty boring , and the press have already gone home .
This was simply not the case during the last period .
And this Parliament has been calling for optimum use of funds for years .
I would like to cite an example that underlines my doubts .
This House called for this report to include a chapter specifically devoted to equal opportunities .
I would like to concentrate on two issues .
That means that disparities in regional development continue to exist , even if the overall level is higher .
This is of course totally unsatisfactory as far as I and my group are concerned .
Moreover , this report reveals some mismanagement in the allocation of the Structural Funds .
We denounce this type of practice as lacking in transparency .
Firstly , we must leave room for prioritising the interventions relating to urban development .
Only when it came to monitoring interventions was 1998 a poor year .
Finally , I believe that there is a great deal of merit in Amendment No 5 .
It also encourages pioneering activities .
I understand that serious consideration is already being given to its use in other parts of the European Union .
Several speakers in this debate have drawn attention to that .
However , the reality of the situation is even worse .
Moreover , the distribution of unemployment is extremely uneven .
People in work are a guarantee of peace and freedom in Europe .
We must make use of regional policy on both a large and a small scale .
The importance of the latter cannot be emphasised enough .
This is now being brought into question by the Commission , something I find hard to understand .
The Structural Funds cannot operate in isolation .
We also refer to that principle in the report .
The Structural Funds are therefore very important and have to function well .
This is something which we must be helped at all levels to change .
There must also be built-in assessment mechanisms .
This is particularly true in the case of Italy .
The result is certainly not outstanding .
Mrs Schroedter or Mr Markov have noted disparities that are still unacceptable .
As to my second point : monitoring , evaluation and control .
Firstly , finalising a harmonised methodology .
Naturally , it is a complex business .
Recently , I even heard calls for less of the Brussels bureaucracy , for fewer complications .
Many of you , including Mrs Attwool and Mr MacCormick , have raised the matter of additionality .
You asked me about your draft Article 5 .
The principle of partnership is one which the Commission hopes to make as comprehensive as possible .
But the Commission goes much further with the new legislation for 2000-2006 .
Fourthly , complementarity with other Community policies .
Mrs Flesch , Mr Turco yourself , Mrs Schroedter , Mr Mastorakis , you stressed this point .
I would also echo Mrs Sudre ' s comments on this .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Barnier .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
Topical and Urgent Debate
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
Basic freedoms in Serbia and Kosovo
I , at any rate , have not changed my name .
I am still called Swoboda and I am also proud of this typical German name .
I would be grateful if this could be corrected where it is wrongly shown .
Thank you .
The population only gets information from the subjective viewpoint of Mr Milosevic and his wife Mrs Markovic .
This means that she cannot understand why this young woman is involved in the OTPOR organisation .
We will , of course , take this opportunity to sound out what scope there is for supporting them .
They are forbidden to give lectures and they have been removed from their posts because of allegedly inadequate qualifications .
I find it hard to imagine that these universities would employ unqualified Serbian professors .
But , of course , they did not fit in with Milosevic ' s doctrines .
You can imagine how they rate quality there !
Today ' s debate is , of course , first and foremost concerned with conditions in Serbian prisons .
The situation in these prisons is indescribable .
The people have received no legal representation .
If they are then sentenced , this happens with total disregard for the law .
She was sentenced to 14 years in prison in Serbia , in Nis .
The prisons are certainly not in line with any convention , and contravene the Geneva Convention .
There is horrifying torture and abuse , and the world is simply looking on .
I do not think that we can simply file these 75 000 signatures away .
That is the picture in Serbia .
I believe that we should focus our attention on ensuring that coexistence is possible there .
There have been murders of Serbs over the last few days .
But in Kosovo there is also the problem of missing Serbs , which we are all familiar with .
They are viewed as traitors by some of their own compatriots .
We must try to ensure greater police protection .
Mr President , freedom of the media lies at the heart of democracy .
And I know just how painful that is from personal experience .
That much should be clear to us .
It is not impossible to transform society even in these circumstances , as we saw 11 years ago .
That is what we have to concentrate on .
We should not always let bureaucratic obstacles get in the way .
We really must find out what can be done under European mechanisms .
And the answer is that they allow more to be done than has been evident up to now .
If that happened things would be much , much more difficult and would take much longer .
The Serbs , Roma and other minorities have a right to live there !
Mr President , fellow Members , this resolution deals in a meticulous way with a number of practical problems .
I would just like to highlight the issue of Kosovar prisoners , as did Mrs Schroedter .
Obviously , there is also all the repression in Serbia .
It was successful and a victory for justice and human rights .
Now , it is the Serbs who need our attention .
The police are doing everything possible , but nothing like the promised number of police has arrived .
The KLA ' s criminal activity must be brought to an end .
The EU countries must send more police and judges .
The Serbs must be helped to return home .
Attempts must also be made to help groups of Serbs in Serbia itself .
The daily news is witness to the oppressive actions of the Yugoslavian government .
And those who have remained are regularly attacked and , in many cases , killed .
Some of them have had to leave Kosovo and others have been forced to remain silent .
In Serbia , the centre of the ' Women in Black ' is currently under threat of closure .
It may be that we should be the ones to give them strong support in Serbia and Kosovo .
He shies away from a democratic confrontation with the opposition .
Every day , we are confronted with examples of repression .
The independent media are thwarted .
A very negative trend is setting in .
Politicians are under threat .
There is a murderous atmosphere .
The assaults are relentless .
CCL recently branded them terrorists .
Measures are also being prepared against the universities so as to force students to keep calm .
We are sitting on the sidelines and can do all too little to bolster the democratic powers .
We have insufficient direct influence on the situation in Serbia itself .
It is nonetheless important that we express our indignation once again today .
The opposition in Serbia needs us .
A great deal of aid has been set aside for Serbia within the framework of the Stability Pact .
But in addition to this , it must also be possible to give the independent media some backing .
In my opinion , this proposal is worth a very serious effort .
We have some opportunities here .
We must at the same time be very much aware that the issue of protecting minorities also affects Serbia .
We are calling for him to be released as a matter of urgency .
Instead we should now ensure that we build up this region ' s police force and administration .
We can no longer dodge the vital issue , which is the very future of Kosovo !
The situation in Kosovo today is different .
This is just as unacceptable as the previous situation was .
Against this background , I am sceptical to say the least about the elections and their results .
Will we ever be able to say , we are putting an end to the embargo ?
That is the question which at some point will need an answer .
I would like to illustrate this link by referring to the position of Mrs Rada Trajkovic from Grazanica .
This medical doctor forms part of the political leadership of the moderate Serbs in Kosovo .
In my opinion , this is an impossible criterion for granting aid , given the current situation .
Or do those drafting the joint resolutions have specific arguments underlying this proposal in Paragraph 14 ?
Do not forget the Serbian people who have stayed behind in Kosovo .
They find themselves in a difficult situation .
Even the Serbian regime would prefer it if they were not there .
They are despondent and fearful .
It is up to you to offer them safety and freedom .
Only then will you be able to enjoy your own freedom . "
We are dealing with an ever more hard-line dictatorship in Serbia .
That is the situation we are dealing with .
The entire instability of the region is due to him .
As long as this regime continues to exist , so will the instability in this region .
The media of course play an important role in this context .
As I see it , this is a sign of weakness .
This is normally a sign of the beginning of the end .
But in this case , unfortunately , the end could last a very long time .
We have been doing that for years .
It is not , for example , as if objective reporting is not penetrating into the region .
Let me mention the other examples from this overall project .
Overall , the EU is supporting the democratic reform process in Montenegro in a wide-ranging and active way .
That brings me to Kosovo , where ethnically motivated violence still dominates everyday life .
The European Union will always condemn such violence with equal force .
It is clear to us that a continuing substantial level of EC aid will be required .
This aid will be provided via the reconstruction agency and the fourth pillar .
Against this background , the Commission welcomes the conclusions of the most recent European Parliament mission to Kosovo .
We have started it and we are determined to bring it to a successful conclusion .
Mr President , we have just heard an outstanding speech by a highly qualified representative of the Commission .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Coup d 'état in Paraguay
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
As is customary in the House , we have tried to agree on a joint resolution .
Unfortunately , we cannot put our names to it as it stands .
We have tried , in our resolution , to emphasise both these factors simultaneously .
Paraguay is one of the worst examples of this .
The second point that I would like to mention relates to Paraguay and Brazil .
Mr Lipietz has already touched upon this , but with a somewhat different emphasis .
Oviedo was arrested in Brazil and I hope that he will be extradited to Paraguay .
There is nothing separating us on that .
However , you cannot of course write a whole book in a short resolution .
The history of Paraguay is one of the saddest and most unjust in Latin America .
Only women and some old men and children survived those wars .
The Paraguayan people never gave in .
The European Union has already been active in Paraguay for a good many years .
Our attempts to have a concrete influence on the situation there have focused on two areas .
The first of these is to develop and strengthen democratic institutions .
The support programme for the Paraguayan Parliament has already gone through three stages .
There is now a further project entitled " Modernising the institutions " .
In this case a number of major programmes with significant budgets have already started .
Nevertheless , it is true that we do not have a permanent representative on the spot .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
The OAS has not adopted sanctions against Peru at the moment either .
We are therefore dealing with a far weaker declaration than the one we wanted .
First , we deplore such a cautious choice of words .
The excess vote was around 20 % in some places .
These are the two amendments that would enable us simply to support the joint motion for a resolution .
The situation in Peru , like the situation in Paraguay , gives cause for concern .
I hope that the European Parliament ' s views on Peru will not go unheard in that country .
I know that a great many people set a lot of store by what this Parliament says .
I accordingly hope that we will obtain a large majority in favour of this resolution .
Mr President , the situation in Peru worries us .
Furthermore , the President ' s disregard for the rule of law became evident .
By taking this attitude , I believe that the OAS has discredited itself considerably .
As has already been mentioned , a similar decision was taken by the Organisation of American States .
For example , we were discussing Paraguay just a few minutes ago .
The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed .
If we want to deal with a serious agenda , then we need to attend .
Spread the word to your fellow delegates , persuade them to attend without biting their heads off .
Vote ( continuation )
That is exactly what was on my list .
The amendment has been voted upon as I announced it .
We now come to the final vote .
This makes a difference and affects the way we vote .
They have already been voted upon .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Mr President , on a point of order .
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Tunisia ( B5-0508 / 2000 )
Marset Campos Report ( A5-0133 / 2000 )
Bordes ( GUE / NGL ) .
Schmitt Report ( A5-0123 )
Berthu ( UEN ) .
We have good reason to be surprised at this introduction to the subject .
Why launch a discussion ?
Yes , the need to harmonise asylum standards is broadly recommended by these texts .
But , first and foremost , the reasoning seems weak .
We risk being caught up in the system .
Mr President , this explanation of vote is also shared by Arlette Laguiller and Armonie Bordes .
Mr President , I abstained in the vote because I do not consider that these texts serve much purpose .
Moreover , the States on the edges of the Schengen zone are considered to be " secure " .
They therefore become the border guards of fortress Europe .
The creation of a legal penal system cannot be achieved in haste .
This House does not want to improve the situation for asylum seekers .
So what about the recurring proposal that costs should be shared ?
If such and such a country finds its policy too expensive , let it change the policy .
Respect for human rights should be maintained internationally .
No countries can argue their way out of responsibility when refugees seek asylum on their territory .
They often have experience and knowledge to contribute to society .
This basic principle is established in the Geneva Convention and must be given due attention and complied with .
Germany has virtually ceased to grant asylum .
Refugees are socially and legally marginalised or driven into the world of illegal immigrants .
The aim of the Schmitt report is to extend this degrading and inhumane system to the entire European Union .
The problems of asylum legislation are not addressed in the Schmitt report .
There is not a single word about inhumane pre-expulsion detention centres .
In Germany , they are categorically forbidden to work .
They have become the first " transparent people " .
Mr Schmitt ' s report does not offer any potential solutions to all these problems .
Asylum-seekers are accordingly denigrated as being a burden .
Furthermore , the Schmitt report welcomes agreements whereby third countries would promise to readmit rejected asylum-seekers .
Unfortunately , Mr Schmitt ' s report goes in the opposite direction .
It was our pride and our duty .
In my opinion , the standards set by the report are too low .
There are omissions and certain points are still unclear .
Persecution is not just political or caused by the States .
Certain States that persecute dissidents are considered to be great democracies .
This is why requests from Chechnya are not examined .
In order to grant the right of asylum , the States require proof of persecution .
But this is often difficult to provide , due to the persecution itself .
The report remains vague on this subject .
I abstained on Amendment No 14 .
This amendment admittedly aims to protect data on the information gathered .
Report Sörensen ( A5-0126 / 2000 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
For this reason I am satisfied by this European Union initiative .
We therefore applaud those sentiments in the Sörensen report which support our view .
- ( FR ) Congratulations !
As highlighted in the report , the number of crime victims is constantly increasing .
What is the solution ?
For us , the Members of the National Front , it is different .
It is not the symptoms of the problem that must be treated , but the cause .
So wake up and take responsibility !
First of all , learn to take responsibility , learn to govern .
Report Turco ( A5-0138 / 2000 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
There is too much wastage and the desired objectives are not being achieved .
I feel that it is time to change the European Union ' s system of expenditure .
. ( IT ) The Union for a Europe of Nations Group agrees with Mr Turco ' s report .
The final point has to be the detection of fraud .
This last aspect is , in fact , an unambiguous indication of commitment and political determination .
Should the need arise , the offended party can always take the necessary action through the appropriate channels .
But freedom of speech must be upheld !
I fail to understand why Mrs Napoletano involved my party in the matter .
I am genuinely perplexed .
I therefore feel that it is for the Presidency to clarify the sequence of events .
Ladies and gentlemen , it is neither the time nor the place to start this debate .
I personally cannot give you any explanation at present .
Cohesion Fund ( 1998 )
However , we should point out two problems for the future .
Lastly , I would like to take up a series of recommendations regarding the Cohesion Fund .
Thirdly , we should pay greater attention to sustainable means of transport .
Fourthly , we need to take more action in the field of reforestation and land reclamation .
Fifthly , we must tackle the problem of the treatment of residues and solid waste .
Lastly , as we pointed out previously , we need more investment in urban centres .
Unfortunately , there is still quite a large imbalance in relation to the roads sector .
This is something which , in our view , is very important .
Naturally , the amount of waste ought also to be reduced .
We therefore expect a more refined evaluation by the Commission of the application of the funds .
I would ask the Commissioner to give his opinion in this respect .
Today , four countries are directly concerned by the objective of cohesion .
I would like to thank him for his clear-sightedness , precision and competence .
Furthermore , several speakers from all parties have thanked him .
The form of the report is just as important as its content .
I share this concern .
This was not by chance , Mrs Schörling .
This tendency has been realised in the approval of this amendment .
It seems to me that these comments are based on a misunderstanding , which I would like to clarify .
I am particularly interested in this issue .
The information requested by Parliament is available in the individual programming documents .
This seems to me to be a more consistent approach for these countries .
Mrs Schörling , you spoke of the matter of additionality .
This report is even more useful in that it is comprehensive .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
Integrated control system for Community aid schemes
In this respect , the Commission should reduce its requirements to what is necessary and reasonable .
We do not want to turn farmers into bureaucrats .
The simplification of the legislation applying the CAP is an absolute priority .
This situation creates various control limits .
Mr Casaca has made a very good effort to explain it to Parliament .
It is extremely important .
We had the possibility for large amounts of fraud and racketeering through the payment of monetary compensatory amounts .
With the reorganisation of the policy we have a new situation .
The changes to the whole system have made it easier to control .
The proposed changes will readjust our system of accounting to the new policies that have been devised .
This is welcome .
In relation to the amendments proposed by Mr Casaca , we can support all of them .
We have received complaints from some people about the proposal to introduce tobacco .
But we spend EUR 1 000 million on the tobacco regime .
That is a lot of money .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Casaca on his excellent report .
My group will of course support it .
The integrated administration and control system is actually the central plank of our present agriculture policy .
We need reliable information on final beneficiaries , the number of animals kept and the surface area being cultivated .
We learnt that when the present system was introduced under the 1992 regulation .
We cannot allow delays of this kind to occur again .
This subject was addressed at the time of the 1998 final discharge .
That alone is not enough .
Of these , some 12 % were checked , partly on the spot and partly by satellite .
Of those applications checked , over 40 % were inaccurate .
We should not of course immediately assume that deception was intended in every case .
Nevertheless , these amounts add up to millions of course .
These figures therefore demonstrate just how urgently a properly functioning control system is required .
So is there a kind of fraud-free zone in the EU ?
I very much doubt it .
The problem we have here also occurs in other budget areas .
The far-reaching management and control measures which the Commission proposes are therefore very appropriate indeed .
I do , however , wonder whether the proposed measures are the most effective .
The Committee claims that , when data is collected , the existing databases are ignored , would you believe !
This is how useful information for managing Community aid falls by the wayside .
But surely this is no reason to ignore this information .
If the regulation has been amended to this effect , we will back it without hesitation .
In fact , these products have all been subject to fraud and irregularity in the past .
However , IACS will , of course , be applied as far as possible in these cases .
The Commission must also retain the right to carry out checks in relation to IACS .
We believe that the effect of this would be exactly the opposite of what we wish to achieve .
What we are looking for here is subsidiarity .
We cannot carry out all the checks from Brussels .
There is no problem there .
The issue here is to what extent actual incidences of fraud are not subject of adequate prosecutions .
Just one brief observation , Commissioner .
I hope that there will be no further need for negotiations and clarification within the Commission .
We will be glad to support you on this .
I would like to make it clear that I did not say that we require anything to be clarified .
I simply said that any decision would have to be taken in the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m.
Nuts and locust beans
These crops offer protection against erosion and desertification and play the role of firebreaks .
The Community ' s level of self-sufficiency in this area is between 50 and 60 % .
In fact , over the last ten years the price has remained the same .
The tariff for hazelnuts stands at 3.3 % .
Nevertheless , a lower rate of 3 % is applied for products from Turkey .
In view of these difficulties , a support system was introduced back in 1989 .
This system involved a significant financial commitment .
In addition , a separate flat-rate aid for hazelnuts was introduced in 1997 .
We only provide 50 % of the supply , for the rest we depend on other countries .
At this rate , we will end up with nothing .
You cannot continue to insist that you alone are right and that we are all mistaken .
The sector produces a surplus and Community protection is minimal .
In my opinion , there have been three changes .
Brussels does not want to be involved .
We are told : there was the 1989 regulation , but it was provisional .
The fixed aid for hazelnuts in 1996 was temporary .
These measures have run their course and must come to an end .
But to put an end to Community funding is to spoil what has been achieved .
We are importing .
And if that is making profits for Turkey , then fair enough , but making profits for California !
We must prevent a rural exodus .
Our honey over Chinese , Canadian or Mexican honey .
Not for a fistful of dollars , but for a fistful of euros .
However , this does not make the production in the European Union any less important .
Mr President , I would just like to respond , very briefly , to the most important arguments raised .
It has been argued that we are talking about a long-term investment here .
That is quite right .
Every farmer knew for exactly how many years he would be receiving support .
We need to be very clear about that here .
I have explained that there are new options .
You cannot be right on both counts .
You cannot have it both ways !
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m.
( The sitting was closed at 8.15 p.m. )
Mr President , on a point of order .
Fifteen of them were the right way up but the Union flag was upside-down .
Mr President , I have news for Mr Helmer , which should encourage him .
He should be grateful that we see our Union flag up at all .
I am advised that it is the most popular flag to be stolen in this place .
We will now have to deal with these matters at home .
There are , however , no attendance allowances for working at home .
I call on all colleagues to do likewise .
Mr Van Hulten had better start saving up now !
( Applause )
Mr President , in its wisdom , the House has made a decision on Friday sittings .
We will certainly note your suggestion .
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
The Minutes are correct in this respect .
I take note of your comment , Mrs Berger .
I should like to draw that to your attention .
Thank you for bringing this to our attention .
We shall verify this and rectify it , if necessary .
( The Minutes were approved )
( Parliament approved the Commission proposal )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Motion for a resolution ( B5-0566 / 2000 ) on aid for nuts and locust beans
( Parliament adopted the resolution ) Explanation of vote
Ripoll y Martinez de Bedoya report ( A5-0140 / 2000 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
I am therefore using the time available to me to make this statement .
Of course I voted for the report .
Casaca report ( A5-0137 / 2000 )
European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ( EMCDDA )
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
New members should certainly be welcomed , but with what in mind ?
To add to the length of the beautifully presented annual reports which achieve precisely nothing ?
What is the Centre waiting for to evaluate these strategies ?
How is it that Member States are being so reluctant to cooperate in evaluation ?
Is it possible that there is a fear that the results may not be that great politically ?
This , moreover , is a necessary precondition to taking on new members .
This is a political issue .
I also have memories of other Community institutions .
We have happily set up over the years several semi-European institutions in different Member States .
Some of them have matured and grown and become quite effective .
It is appropriate that at the moment we are assessing the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction .
That makes us feel good but does not actually change anything .
So it is appropriate that we look at the work of this observatory in Lisbon at this stage .
We should not kill it off until we are sure it is not being effective .
They have all been quite horribly murdered by people coming from some of the accession states to the Community .
So it is important that we include them in the work of this observatory .
I would like to thank both the rapporteurs .
They have done a good , serious job .
They have asked very serious questions .
The point was made that three years is far too long between assessments .
This is especially important and significant when we look at the whole question of enlargement .
That must be our starting-point .
We also have to be realistic about what we want from the Centre .
For the work of the Monitoring Centre in Lisbon to be effective , Member States have to cooperate fully .
As Mrs Banotti has just said , the agencies have to be involved .
Mr Blokland said that we should not include Turkey .
They want to address this problem .
Of course , there is not enough being done .
There needs to be more progress .
I congratulate Mr Sousa Pinto and Mr Turco .
As a result , the consensus enjoyed hitherto will be abandoned .
The purely information-gathering centre is to be converted into a drugs-combating centre .
But there never will be a drug-free society .
Or are cigarettes and alcohol going to be banned too ?
Last year in Germany alone , there were over 1 800 .
European drugs policy therefore needs a new guiding principle .
This principle is called damage limitation .
In addition , the Commission is making life difficult for NGOs working on drugs .
As far as I am concerned , this is the wrong way forward .
Firstly , this is a positive evaluation which is consistent with the Commission ' s proposal .
I wish it could be so but I cannot share her optimism .
Finally , I should like to thank the two rapporteurs for their thorough work .
It would appear that this is not the case , however .
Resources must be increased via the PHARE and TACIS programmes .
All the PHARE countries have to be made to go the way of Norway .
And they must be given the technical assistance to do so .
No such conditions are imposed on the aid by the World Bank or the IMF .
That applies both to citizens down on the floor of the House and to those up in the gallery .
Drugs breed crime and social destitution and tear many people ' s lives apart .
Otherwise , the statistical basis will be fairly meagre and not serve any larger purpose .
I should like to say that the definition of a drugs-free society is a good one .
It is an aggressive approach I should like to see maintained .
The fight against drug abuse and the drug trade is important .
This report has been produced to complement the current regulation concerning the Monitoring Centre .
Moreover , it is intended that the candidate countries should be involved in the work .
Let me comment on that first of all .
It is , in fact , important that the candidate countries be involved .
I myself come from Sweden .
The drug trade is not confined by national borders .
We must therefore have cross-border cooperation to prevent the trade from developing .
The same applies to cooperation with Norway .
Norway participates in the internal market and is to become a member of Schengen .
The rapporteur also deals with how the Centre operates at present .
I think he draws an important distinction , for the Centre should not be dabbling in politics .
However , the Centre should create a basis for political decisions .
In this regard , there are at present deficiencies when it comes to collecting statistics .
We must obtain relevant and reliable information which can be compared .
The joint debate is closed .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
Report ( A5-0147 / 2000 )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Report ( A5-0157 / 2000 )
Following the vote on the Commission proposal .
I therefore call upon Parliament to postpone the vote .
I see that our co-rapporteur is also requesting the floor .
I would point out to you that Article 69 stipulates that this procedure takes place without debate .
( Parliament rejected the request ) ( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
On the other hand , the directive is not open to subjective interpretation .
I would point out that copyrights last for as long as 70 years in a number of States .
At present , there are only two areas on which the rapporteur and my group disagree .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Application of Community law ( 1998 )
The European Parliament must also reiterate its request for information concerning the application of international standards .
This is where the whole question of the infringement procedure comes in .
As for methods , I think they can be improved .
I therefore support this amendment .
Finally , there is the problem of the preliminary question .
When such questions are badly drawn up , the effect can run counter to the aim of legal clarification .
I therefore suggest that the Court of Justice reconsider the way this procedure works .
The current state of affairs in Europe ' s construction tends to emphasise the principle of subsidiarity .
In consideration of this key principle , I am opposed to Amendment No 3 .
I do not consider creating a European administrative law to be appropriate .
There are numerous reasons for non-transposition and they need to be studied .
Also , it is time that we considered political methods for reducing delays .
A general campaign is needed here .
The present Grotius and Falcone programmes have become out-dated as a result of developments .
This committee forms the interface between the European citizen , the European Parliament and the Commission .
And so indeed it must .
Alas , we know that it is not so in all cases .
The law of Italy has not yet been brought into conformity with it , to satisfy their rights .
No rights are more important than those against discrimination and those in favour of freedom of movement .
If we do not satisfy these we let ourselves down in the face of our own aspirations .
I shall be following that up and we may have to look into it again .
This type of constraining , over-regulated Europe is certainly not the one our respective fellow citizens want .
The way in which this report has been adopted is appalling .
Rather than unnecessary amendments , I should like a response to the following question .
Anyone who breaks the law or perverts the course of justice violates certain values .
And anyone who violates these values can be judged and condemned under the law .
And I therefore call upon you to repair that damage .
My second comment concerns the Commission as guardian of the Treaties .
My third comment is that yesterday I made a mistake !
I should like to say this in conclusion .
That is wrong ; they voted in favour .
But I must admit my mistake .
We shall have to vote on these amendments , but in another report .
I should like to mention a few points in relation to Mrs Grossetête ' s report .
Next year , Commissioner , we should like to see a more balanced and exhaustive report drawn up .
Mr President , I want to thank Mrs Grossetête for her report .
These are increasingly being brought to the attention of Members of Parliament .
In those days Parliament did not have the same power or prestige that it has today .
But there are other areas where there is a lot of confusion .
I was at a conference last week .
If that happens , there will be a lot of movement of people .
This is why I urge you to vote in favour of Amendments Nos 2 and 3 .
The debate is closed .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
This is why we absolutely cannot accept this report .
It is a question of respecting national sovereignty .
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
( The sitting was closed at 12 noon )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday , 16 June 2000 .
Statement by the President
This was on 18 June .
We must take every possible action to dismantle this ' industry ' dealing in death .
The legal bases for action are in place . All we need is genuine political will .
Action must be taken now .
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Some of the journalists were arrested simply because they were doing their duty .
Thank you , Mr Tajani .
I see that you agree to this suggestion .
Thank you .
I would therefore like to thank you for your work .
As far as the Rotterdam incidents are concerned , I am in complete agreement with Mr Tajani .
This will give Parliament the opportunity to express a considered , responsible opinion on the matter .
This bill has not yet been adopted .
Mr Swoboda , I willingly take note of your statement and your request .
It was an excellent day out in Rotterdam .
It was one of the best football matches I have ever attended .
The atmosphere was anything but hostile .
It was one of the best atmospheres I have experienced at a cup final .
Even so , we shall , nonetheless , look into the incident reported by Mr Tajani and Mrs Napoletano .
You can count on me to proceed with the requisite diplomacy .
Madam President , I would like to draw your attention to yesterday ' s elections in Mexico .
There has been a change of power there .
The so-called institutional revolution , which lasted seventy years , has ended .
I would ask you to send greetings to the new president .
We can certainly all be happy about this change of power , because no revolution can last seventy years .
Thank you , Mr Blak .
So , yes , the referees , like both teams indeed , were excellent .
The Indo-Fijians , the Indian population of Fiji , are in considerable danger .
There is no confidence that the constitution will be applied properly and will be observed .
( Parliament rejected the request ) President .
Here the issue is Tibet .
We know how important this is .
In 1992 I personally produced a report on Tibet .
A motion reflecting the report 's conclusions was adopted almost unanimously by Parliament .
We have adopted resolutions on this subject time and time again .
It is a country that is illegally occupied by China and its people are oppressed by that regime .
These measures were initially supported by the World Bank , Germany , the United States and the United Kingdom .
Now that the pressure has been put on , Germany and the United States have withdrawn their support .
The World Bank is withdrawing support but it has not yet said so publicly .
( Parliament rejected the request )
We shall examine each of these requests in turn .
It is an old and yet highly topical matter .
It is with this in mind that I ask you to support our request .
( Parliament rejected the request from the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance ) President .
This is our opportunity to do so .
It seems to me to be obvious that we should await the outcome of your mission .
( Parliament rejected the request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists )
Madame Napoletano , I do not think that I need to put this proposal to the vote .
Everyone has heard the suggestion .
( Parliament rejected the request from the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party )
The Member State which has responsibility for that question is the United Kingdom .
Madam President , I will not tire of appealing to the consciences of my colleagues .
This also applies here , to Iraq .
All the issues are covered .
( Parliament rejected the request ) President .
I shall personally , therefore , abstain from voting on the proposal , though unwillingly .
( Parliament rejected the request ) President .
There is no need for me to describe the concerns felt by those living in the adjoining areas .
The whole thing could happen as early as next week .
I think that the European Parliament also ought to speak out on this .
I am rather torn .
Madam President , this is a point of order .
I do not know which Rule of the Rules of Procedure this is based on .
I would be grateful if you could explain this to me , Madam President .
Mr Barón Crespo , this is perfectly permissible under the Rules of Procedure .
Having said that , you have just expressed out loud what many people were thinking to themselves .
But I will be brief .
As you know , the Monitoring Centre is in Vienna .
Now it appears that the difficulties are being resolved and that better relations are once again being established .
That is why we should like to add this item .
Therefore I would appeal to Members to vote against this request .
( The order of business was adopted thus amended )
European Council / Portuguese presidency
Thank you , Mr President .
I now give the floor to Mr Patten to speak on behalf of the Commission .
Can I also say that it is a privilege to follow that characteristically eloquent and politically perceptive speech .
The European Council on 19 and 20 June was a very valuable meeting of important consolidation .
( Applause )
I notice that Mr Helmer is not here to join in the applause .
( Laughter )
Thirdly , some progress was achieved on completing the internal market .
The Commission will be putting forward proposals on these matters before the end of the year .
Trafficking in human beings is a serious international crime that no one government can tackle single-handedly .
Our citizens expect no less than that , and we must live up to their expectations .
The Commission has been working energetically in this area .
The European Council expressed strong support for what we are doing .
This complex agreement involves the directive on the taxation of savings .
The directive should be adopted by unanimity no later than 31 December 2002 .
We welcome the positive outcome .
The conflict nevertheless continues and we still have considerable concerns .
In particular , we want to see much greater access for humanitarian aid agencies .
I welcome the adoption of the common strategy on the Mediterranean .
The presidency should take particular credit for driving that through .
It will help our efforts to strengthen the Barcelona process .
The Commission will be presenting proposals to reinvigorate the process later this month .
We welcome the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon .
The Prime Minister again referred to the importance of that .
I just want to add a couple of points .
That would give them the best sort of assistance in the months and years ahead .
Before I conclude , I would like to say something briefly about the EU-India Summit .
India is the greatest democracy in the world .
To conclude , the Feira Council crowned an extremely successful Portuguese presidency .
The Prime Minister mentioned some of the constitutional discussions that we have started to have in the European Union .
I am tempted to follow him down some of those highways and byways .
Obviously we need to have some important political debates .
I very much hope that they will have as much success as the Portuguese Presidency .
I am sure they will be as engaging to work with .
( Applause )
There are at least two questions that I wish to ask you with regard to your speech .
It is therefore worth tempering words and intentions with reality .
As a result of your action , the Austrian question has become a European Union issue .
Closer cooperation must therefore not lead to a two-speed Europe .
In this respect we cannot invoke banking secrecy .
As far as the results of the Feira summit are concerned , however , we are rather more sceptical .
Many of these were already left unresolved in Amsterdam .
The public 's confidence in the EU has now reached an all-time low in all the Member States .
In eastern Europe frustration is growing at the EU 's hesitant attitude .
It was a disappointment for that very reason .
There are also grounds for concern in another area , however .
I am referring to the revision of the Treaties .
The worst thing is that other people seem to be distracted ...
In addition to this , it works well , as the Portuguese Presidency has clearly demonstrated .
Those who wish to see the Union ' s system of a rotating presidency changed are wrong .
If there is one negative side to this six-month term , it is the Austrian question .
The Portuguese Presidency alone cannot be blamed for the mistake , as I have to call it .
In the European Parliament alone , 406 Members supported this disastrous move .
We cannot develop a short memory once we realise our mistake .
Austria held elections and will continue to do so .
They did nothing that constitutes a violation of the Treaties and their guarantees .
Today there is growing embarrassment .
Everyone is wandering around with a torch , looking for a graceful way out .
There will certainly be a way out , but I doubt that it will be a graceful one .
It is now the responsibility of the French Presidency to find it .
We shall see !
We are all aware of the differences of opinion and the difficulties that already existed .
Jacques Chirac ' s speech to the Bundestag was ill-judged and ill-timed .
It showed a lack of vision and a lack of respect , from what one can see .
It served only to create distrust in an atmosphere that is already very sensitive .
This type of speech is not pro-European , and in fact , is clearly anti .
What kind of madness is this ?
Where is the sense in such a contradiction ?
Any idea of a pioneer group does not correspond to the idea of European cooperation that unites us .
This is not the Europe to which we belong .
We must tackle the issue of China .
China is as close to us now as were the totalitarian regimes before the Second World War .
Yet we pretend not to notice , we continue to deal with China on a priority basis .
Absolutely everything is based on an intergovernmental approach .
We cannot ask Mr Solana questions .
We do not know what matters he is dealing with .
As the European Parliament , we do not have any scope to intervene .
We do not know what tasks you , the Council , have given him .
It is just not possible for us to go on exacerbating the sideways shift in the wrong direction .
The precedence of EU law may be dated back to the judgements given in 1962 and 1964 .
The right of veto in accordance with the Luxembourg Compromise prevailed from 1966 to 1986 .
Feira put the issue on the Intergovernmental Conference ' s agenda .
This will be the enduring image of Feira .
That may be true , Prime Minister Guterres , for the routine tasks .
Why does this matter ?
This must be noted .
There is no doubt that this is a difficult business .
That is why we need to put more effort into making progress here .
It is regrettable that this has happened under your presidency .
Firstly , it has adopted a new political stance .
Secondly , there is the Portuguese Presidency ' s assertion of civil values and respect for human dignity .
Your conclusion is that European ambition is not the heritage of large countries alone .
I should like briefly to make three points .
Firstly , the Presidency Conclusions say of the Intergovernmental Conference that significant headway is being made .
But no mention was made of this in Feira .
The public do not want yet another grandiose-sounding piece of paper .
A so-called Community of values cannot end at Lake Constance .
This is something that the Commission and many in this House would like to see .
I only hope that the French Presidency will follow in its footsteps .
The European Union is at the most crucial crossroads in its history .
And it is certainly not the present structure .
I have two comments to make on this .
But did this extra-institutional dialogue perhaps affect the wording of the Feira resolutions ?
Is that perhaps why the conclusions on institutional matters were so brief ?
I hope not .
Mr Brok and I stressed this several times at the Intergovernmental Conference .
The central tenet of the Franco-German dialogue is clear : we need a two-speed Europe .
Mr President , my assessment is a rather critical one .
The future of Europe depends on two major issues : democracy and employment .
Greater democracy means guaranteeing full authority to adopt legislation and initiatives to the peoples ' elected representatives .
Employment policy is short-sighted and biased towards the market .
Mr President , the Feira Council neither surprised nor disappointed us .
I would be grateful if the Bureau could clarify matters for us .
We will clarify this matter , Mr Ribeiro e Castro .
I cannot therefore allow you to speak any further .
Nevertheless , what you have said has now been said and it will be useful and have an effect .
I am consequently obliged to confine myself to a few brief and far from comprehensive comments .
Portugal , quite rightly , focussed the European debate on growth and employment .
I am not referring to an economic government .
This essential coordination is aimed at maximising the advantages to the Community of a common economic policy action .
Portugal has helped e-Europe to make progress .
At the moment , information and communication technologies are crowned with all the virtues .
In the end the time was not wasted in exchanging pleasantries .
It was possible to sign real agreements .
The response to the reform process is significant additional investment from Europe .
A green card with a time limit will not work at all .
We need cooperation between European and Indian companies .
Employees can then be posted anywhere and they will have clear contracts which are valid throughout the world .
We have shared values .
In this context I must say that it is regrettable that no timetable was drawn up here .
That would have made the exercise easier .
The conclusion reached postpones the problem for 10 years .
Conversely , issues were debated which at the present time do not belong on the European agenda .
With how many countries should we actually begin further negotiations ?
Only in this way will it be possible to boost the strength of the euro .
That is what the people of the EU rightly expect of us .
The candidate States must not be required to wait for an unreasonable length of time .
The processes must therefore run parallel .
With enlargement , there also comes the demand for an EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
However , the EU Charter puts the EU ' s development in a new perspective .
Or do we prefer more publicly financed welfare and a weak currency ?
We need to replace short-term initiatives with long-term , in-depth cooperation .
The work done by Portugal , as the country holding the presidency , has not been easy .
We are delighted about the formulations concerning enlargement .
For liberals such as ourselves , no task is more important than that of unifying Europe .
Where the reforms and the Intergovernmental Conference are concerned , we are disappointed , however .
We should like to have seen more concrete results .
It is a welcome and wholly necessary debate .
Minimum reforms in Nice will not be enough .
Our citizens expect something more .
We need to discuss the issues surrounding a constitution .
The baton has now been handed over to France .
I feel a certain unease faced with the different signals emanating from the French Presidency .
I should like to address some of the central issues that have arisen in this debate .
Firstly , the danger of a shift towards an intergovernmental approach .
Secondly , the Intergovernmental Conference .
It was not the Portuguese Presidency ' s responsibility to conclude the work of the Intergovernmental Conference .
The next question would be : will it be possible to conclude the IGC ?
To my mind , the issue is now quite clear .
With regard to enlargement , various speakers have said that enlargement cannot be delayed .
The evidence that I can give you is that there has been no delay in the last six months .
As I said a few minutes ago , we closed 72 dossiers for negotiation in six months .
The Lisbon Summit laid down a strategy .
For example , we have discussed small businesses and the European Charter for Small Enterprises has been approved .
In other words , I am genuinely convinced that we can make very rapid progress .
There has so far been no indication that this unanimity can be reached within the Union .
I would like to make it quite clear ...
... I would like to make it quite clear that this runs completely counter to European values .
We should be trying to exercise those powers in a way that is even more democratically accountable .
Let me give the honourable Member an indication of what I mean .
There should be a more serious exchange about our political priorities .
I should like to begin with a few words about the history of this proposal for a directive .
Since as early as 1991 there has been a directive to combat money laundering in Europe .
Others such as Luxembourg have implemented the bare minimum , and inevitably this has caused serious problems .
This has now been done .
On the other hand , I must also make a number of critical comments .
I believe that the Commission has overshot the mark somewhat in its proposal .
It was our task therefore to rectify this in our consultations at the first reading .
I believe that we have succeeded in doing so .
This would make the job impossible .
We rectify this in the amendments .
Unfortunately we did not succeed . But it was not Parliament 's fault .
Since the 1991 directive was adopted many external factors have changed .
This is to the detriment of the budget of the European Communities .
The Commission proposal should be seen in close connection with this article of the Treaty .
Most of the crime which harms the Community budget is also organised crime . The rapporteur is right there .
But there are also exceptions .
The Member States need to have a legal base for their own and the Union ' s sakes .
I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Lehne , for the cooperation which we have enjoyed .
A great deal of work needs to be done .
Otherwise , I think we are wasting our time .
They have been particularly successful .
We should learn from that experience .
This money is laundered and put into circulation in the legal economy .
Because if we succeed in stamping out money laundering then we will also stamp out organised crime .
The situation has changed .
Organised crime is using new kinds of businesses .
Money is being laundered through different channels from the ones which were used in the past .
We will be firmly supporting these proposals from the rapporteur .
But in truth it means something different .
This is called money laundering .
Dirty money is turned into respectable money .
Nevertheless , this new directive is necessary to allow more recent developments to be taken into account .
I therefore say to the Council : make your decision quickly now !
The amounts which change hands in the process run into billions .
The fight against money laundering is also in Europe 's interests .
We must , however , prevent possible new loopholes from opening up .
It must not come to that !
It is now nine years since the 1991 directive was produced and it is time to update it .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m.
Safe harbour privacy principles
The opposing position is unrealistic .
What is our intention ?
It is to safeguard our responsibility , as established in the very ambiguous Amendment No 6 .
But you would have my support , anyway .
However , it does not benefit the citizens .
You say that information can currently be provided by means of a contract .
It is not realistic , Mrs Paciotti , you know it is not realistic .
At the moment , the information is circulating without any guarantee .
Let us turn now to the Safe Harbour .
And it is going to work .
Lastly , cancellation .
This goes against the principles established by the OECD in 1980 .
I will end , Mr President .
If we do that , then what will happen ?
They have their way and we have ours .
They will come to their own conclusions about how they will change their system .
I wish we had that within our European Union .
I urge colleagues in the vote tomorrow to give protection to our citizens now .
Conditionality will mean no protection now .
The ' safe harbour ' system proposed by the American authorities offers no protection at all .
It is a condition sine qua non for any real protection of citizens ' individual liberties .
In conclusion , I should like to remind the Commission that personal data protection is an integral part ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , we fully support Mrs Paciotti ' s report and its conclusions .
Clearly , we cannot know how the United States will react to our concerns .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m.
We then instituted legal action .
We won the case before the European Court of Justice .
Parliament has always been of the opinion that these states should be exempt from visa requirements .
We see this as a step forward .
Obviously these countries have in the meantime also managed to convince the Commission .
My plea to the Council would be that it should debate this regulation as soon as possible .
For example , there was a proposal to introduce so-called reciprocity .
What is this ?
I rejected this .
For this reason I do not believe that we can introduce a provision of this kind .
We have also debated it in Parliament accordingly , I hope , as the Commission had in mind .
Now it is the Council 's turn .
As soon as possible it ought to produce a result which is as constructive as possible .
I would like to draw attention to one or two points from it .
I also want to draw attention to a few amendments .
Amendment No. 2 is important .
We want to make certain in Europe that is not the case working in the opposite direction .
Mr Lehne 's report gives important momentum to this process and we support his report .
We will not therefore be making any recommendations here on how the report should be dealt with .
The Commission has carefully examined the report by Mr Lehne , whom I would like to congratulate .
As regards the amendments to its proposal , the Commission appreciates very much the Parliament 's constructive contribution .
We can also accept Amendments Nos 1 and 5 .
Finally , the Commission is also unable to accept Amendment No 6 .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m.
( The sitting was closed at 9.45 p.m. )
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Yesterday evening I raised two points .
I do not see that minuted .
Could you change that please ?
Mr Haarder , I shall of course take note of your comments .
Mr President , I understand our Danish colleagues ' concern about this air traffic problem .
But things cannot go on like this .
Ladies and gentlemen , your comments are completely justified , and will be passed on to the relevant departments .
I can see the requests to speak piling up on my desk .
I want to refer partly to a point of order and partly to yesterday 's Minutes .
At the moment the Prime Minister spoke about half the Chamber got up to walk out .
I must admit , I find this rather an odd procedure .
I would like to ask you what the reason is behind this procedure .
If someone has identified themselves , surely that is sufficient ?
Surely there is then no need to seize their identity cards or driving licences ?
I shall , of course , ensure that this is done .
Thank you , Mr Camre .
( The Minutes were approved )
The next item is the joint debate on :
It was the PPE and it was you , Mr Elles , who insisted on that .
We are responding to that request .
You insisted on it , we are responding .
I think this is essential and indeed I believe it is the case .
I believe that we are on the brink of a cultural revolution , which will bring about this change .
This is how I see the action plan ; this is how I see our joint action .
I see it as a joint effort with the Commission .
We in Europe want to play a key role in establishing this with the necessary resources .
This brings me to the more general comment I wanted to make .
In this respect , the Kinnock reforms , or the general internal reforms , are essential .
I wish the Commission every success in advance .
We were delighted that the rapporteur saw the error of her ways and supported our way of thinking .
Round one to us , the anti-PPE alliance .
Round two to the anti-PPE alliance .
The Commission responded constructively to most of the points we set out in March .
The only real question that remains is why her name is still on the report .
Can you give us these figures , please ?
It is at the discretion of the chair , Mr van Hulten .
I think Mr Pomés Ruiz is perhaps just a few seconds late .
It is not always easy to get here on time with the lifts we have in Strasbourg .
So , if you have no objections , I shall give him the floor straight away .
My political group , and practically all the others , are complying with the existing regulations .
Your political group has its way of organising its finances , as do all the others .
Mr Kuhne , you know that that is not the case .
We lack regulation .
We believe that the Commission is taking its time .
I can assure her that this will continue to be the case for the next four or five years .
It is up to Parliament to establish this and we will certainly do this .
We expect constructive cooperation from the Commission on this score .
It is the Member States that foot the bill for the European Development Fund .
In April , the power of the plenary meeting became evident .
Our group agrees with the conclusion that discharge may on this occasion be granted .
This is what we normally view as the existence of unused appropriations .
Budgeting is not just about coming up with a few figures .
The Commission knows that there are criminal activities behind these cases .
In the Danish Parliament , we have a saying about the Finance Committee .
That is not the case here .
I am pleased to see that discharge has been granted to Parliament .
I think we have done an excellent job .
It was a useful exercise , properly carried out , and Mr Kuhne should be congratulated .
I think we should be able to vote broadly in favour of his report the day after tomorrow .
I cannot say the same for Mrs Stauner ' s report .
This practice has been appalling .
Right up to the very end , we shall have been witness to abuse of the procedure .
More than 60 % of the report voted upon consisted of amendments .
This clearly demonstrates that the rapporteur must interpret the committee ' s opinion logically .
The rapporteur is supposed to be the spokesperson for the parliamentary committee .
The practice of playing games with the explanatory statement must stop .
It is a matter of some importance .
This Parliament has no clear majority or minority .
We have to rely to a certain extent on parliamentary fair play .
We must ensure that private and public matters are not muddled .
We shall therefore grant the discharge .
We shall support this report which the rapporteur is clearly against .
Let us reject it tomorrow .
Nor do they know if there are any problems regarding the competence of any of the participants .
Nor do we know how much is being paid out to , for example , Danisco .
But not all of us in this House have been heroes .
But where to now ?
Monitoring is necessary to make sure that what we have gained as a Parliament is maintained .
Mr Prodi needs to be supported in his reforms of the Commission .
Our granting discharge for 1998 is , in reality , a vote of confidence .
We are giving the Commission a chance to prove that it is different from the old Commission .
I would also take the opportunity to call for a cessation of hostilities here in Parliament .
We shall not forget them until they have been resolved in a proper and dignified manner .
Let me also say a few words regarding the speeches made by the Socialist Members .
Let me say a few words on the Rühle report .
So , until October , when we shall meet again .
It is they who must improve their books .
Mrs Stauner had to be stopped for speaking too fast at the beginning of this debate .
It is a telling metaphor for the work she did in committee .
Even the Court of Auditors does not agree with her .
Fortunately that view was shared by the majority of the committee .
I should like to address you in the same vein .
Once again , we must deplore Mrs Stauner ' s method .
Today she is still asking questions which have already been explicitly answered .
To close , I would like to ask two of those questions .
If they have , would this not be an abuse of their position ?
( Applause from the right )
Mr President , I want to thank Mrs Stauner , my colleague and good friend , for her report .
Sometimes we seem to forget that we are dealing with the discharge in respect of 1998 .
That is my first point .
The second point is in relation to Fléchard .
The European Commission intervened at that point and proposed a settlement .
It seems to me that equating that with a loss of EUR 14 million is a gross exaggeration .
It went beyond personal insult and such verbal attacks are unworthy of our Parliament .
Statement by Presidency-in-Office of Council - Action programme of French presidency
It is my very great pleasure to give the floor to the French President , Mr Jacques Chirac .
( Loud applause )
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament , thank you for welcoming me here today .
The citizens of Europe want more transparency in the operation of the European institutions .
The time when decisions could be taken behind closed doors has passed .
We shall also be working hand in hand with the European Commission .
This House acknowledged his commitment by electing him its president .
We have lost a great and fine figure in this venture we are all involved in .
I had the opportunity to express my views on this subject last week .
They , of course , extend beyond the limits of the French Presidency of the European Union .
If the IGC were not successful , then it would be pointless to consider the next stages .
The Presidency ' s first focus is on making preparations for the future of Europe , post-enlargement .
Let us not make the mistake of underestimating the importance of the matters on the agenda .
None of us , neither you nor us , can be content with a minimum agreement .
( Applause ) Reform of the institutions will pave the way for enlargement of the European Union .
I am , as you know , a staunch supporter of enlargement .
Opting for the euro means opting for growth and employment .
It is a success .
We can already see the positive effects in all the countries of the European Union .
The French Presidency will be following up the action initiated by this Lisbon Council .
The Charter of Fundamental Rights will have to support this model .
Our priority , then , will be the adoption of a " European social agenda " .
At the same time , we must step up liaison and coordination between our economic policies .
It is vital that the citizens accept the euro .
Everything possible must be done to make a success of this crucial phase in both practical and human terms .
The Presidency will also ensure that links with the outermost regions are consolidated and intensified .
The third focus of the French Presidency will be to bring Europe closer to the citizens .
This is now the legitimate concern of all successive presidencies leading the European Union .
I know that I shall be able to count on the support of this House in this undertaking .
Let us never forget that agriculture is the first of our common policies .
Apart from this , Europe will continue to be in the vanguard of the fight to protect our environment .
The environment must be ever better integrated into European policy .
We all have the Dover tragedy in mind .
There is a real problem which must be investigated and solved .
The French Presidency will make every effort to do so .
( Applause ) The fourth and final focus of our presidency : a Europe with a strong international role .
This legislation must be put into practice and developed .
Europe must be strong and open to the world .
This is precisely what is at issue .
The European Parliament also shares these concerns .
( Applause )
The Commission therefore supports the Presidency in focusing on these issues .
One of the forms of inequality still present in European society is inequality of educational opportunities .
Another source of inequality is the poverty trap in which too many European citizens find themselves .
It is truly scandalous that extreme poverty still exists within our societies .
This means that the legislative process is maturing and becoming more and more consensual .
The President presented four major working areas for the next six-month period .
It would be a good thing if this were applied to the Intergovernmental Conference .
The Commission and the parliaments and the Council and the Court of Justice must all be strengthened .
( Applause )
It is all part of the same package , and it is something that requires serious work .
One of these is the future of public services , of universal European services ,
( Applause )
We think this must be included in the package .
This is an absolute priority !
The third point , a Europe that is closer to the citizens .
We consider this an excellent arena for action to bring Europe closer to the citizens .
( Loud applause )
In conclusion , Madam President , let me turn to foreign policy .
( Loud Applause )
Both make important contributions to the European debate .
The Europe of tomorrow matters to all of us .
In launching such a debate you have done Europe a service .
You have spoken of having more than an accord à minimum .
We certainly agree with that .
We respect the role of the European Commission in bringing balance to our debate and our respective interests .
None of these things are characteristic of intergovernmentalism .
We must be cautious about a drift in that direction .
I agree with you that we should have a constitution for Europe .
It is our historic task to bring about a successful enlargement .
I know from your remarks that you agree with that .
It is important to give that reassurance .
I think we shall be facing such times in the next six months .
This reform must be ambitious .
It cannot be confined to technical amendments just to keep the European machine ticking over .
The globalisation of issues has gained the upper hand in the course of recent years .
The imbalance between north and south has grown worse , as all the international reports confirm .
Poverty in the world is not on the decline , quite the opposite .
The European Union must take the offensive .
I heard you say that you were in favour of this , under France ' s leadership .
This is where we run up against contradictions , however .
Our pattern of development is in question .
It is also in France that the people are most hostile to the dictatorship of free trade .
( Applause )
Have you changed or have times changed to this extent ?
Does one have to be modern to have the support of a few well-meaning broadsheets ?
You recommended saying ' yes ' to Maastricht because the 1995 presidential elections were drawing close .
Because Mr Mitterrand had had his Treaty , you wanted one of your own , in Amsterdam .
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam proved insufficient , you are looking for another , this time in Nice .
Is that not right , Mr Cohn-Bendit ?
( The President cut the speaker off )
I am a member of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities .
Should we not challenge the political dimension it has granted itself ?
We reject government by officials as much as we reject government by judges .
The institutional reform we are promised is putting a stranglehold on our nations , especially the smallest ones .
This is not acceptable .
Does defending the national interest make one anti-European ?
He looked to the IGC to extend the use of codecision .
We also share your concern to have strong institutions , as you emphasised .
I said as much yesterday in Paris , at the meeting with the Commission .
I said this to Mr Prodi .
That goes without saying .
This is perfectly plain as far as the French Presidency is concerned .
I have taken note of the wish to see that the Court of Justice is given the necessary resources .
We shall do everything in our power to achieve this objective .
( Applause )
Quite obviously , this is not France ' s ambition .
( Applause )
He also mentioned the charter of rights .
This is something to which we also attach great importance .
( Applause )
The convention ' s conclusions have not yet been published . We should await their conclusions on this subject .
We need time before we give our opinion on this .
I am not absolutely sure that a clear decision can be taken in Nice .
If it is possible , so much the better .
My response is similar .
This is an extremely important and almost institutional factor in pulling people along .
Enlargement as quickly as possible is not , of course , synonymous with political decision .
Enlargement is not a political decision .
There is no doubt about it .
( Applause )
Mr Lannoye specifically mentioned the problem of closer cooperation .
I have just answered this .
Major debates are underway on the subject of globalisation , as Mr Lannoye pointed out .
It does , therefore , have positive aspects , which it would be foolish to deny .
It also has dangers , however , in three areas in particular .
( Applause )
It is not obvious , but it is a real problem , which must be taken seriously .
( Applause )
Therefore , globalisation does entail risks , but what exactly does that mean ?
( Applause )
We must respond to the concerns of everyday life .
So , there has been some progress .
I have expressed my views on globalisation .
Europe is open , by definition .
Finally , Mr Wurtz mentioned the notorious Tobin tax .
It is one of the subjects we shall also be discussing at the G7 meeting in Okinawa .
Clearly , we are not looking at matters from the same perspective .
( Laughter and applause )
I would make a friendly suggestion that Charles Pasqua thinks about this .
( Laughter and applause )
Mr de Gaulle will probably understand that I do not share his views .
( Applause )
Firstly , cultural diversity and implementation of the principle of subsidiarity .
I unreservedly endorse the expression of this necessity , and the spirit thereof .
Decisions must be taken at the right level .
( Loud applause )
We shall carry on with our debate .
I am sure , Mr Hager , that you share the anxiety of these families .
Madam President , you could not be more wrong .
The reforms of the Commission and the Council must respond to these requirements .
We must reach an agreement , and a good one at that .
According to the schedule , the Council was to have 30 minutes ' speaking time .
President Chirac spoke for one and a quarter hours .
He was entitled to speak before the response from the President-in-Office of the Council .
The President has not fulfilled her obligation to run debates in this House objectively .
It must also answer the question : what do we wish to achieve together ?
I am thinking particularly of the matter of adopting the euro .
The questions that we must also answer are those that our fellow citizens are asking .
They aspire to see Europe operating better .
We are pleased to see that this has been possible .
The French Presidency has set itself the objective of placing Europe at the service of growth and full employment .
We consider this to be an essential point .
What is the point in recognising rights if no legal recourse is possible ?
They cannot comprehend our reluctance in this area .
We need progress here .
The test we are going to have to face in this respect concerns the directive on postal services .
Such services are also part of the modern world , for example Internet access for all .
We hope that the French Presidency will be able to propose a framework directive on this subject .
In the first place , these rights must be enshrined in the forthcoming Charter of Fundamental Rights .
This would be a great disappointment .
This is a good subject of investigation for the intensified cooperation to which the President recently referred once again .
They are , however , merely plans at this stage .
Apparently , Europe is some sort of vamp provoking everyone into political promiscuity .
Ambitious , yes , it is ambitious , but let us see tangible proof of this ambition !
In Berlin , he said we should have enlargement plus constitution at the same time .
Secondly , speaking of a constitution , we must be careful not to be too naive .
Who does what ?
It sounds good but what does it actually mean ?
That is precisely the problem !
If it were quite as simple to perform political surgery , we would make faster progress .
To achieve a social Europe , let us begin by banning layoffs on the part of firms in profit .
It is no coincidence that the Friday sitting has been abolished , Minister .
That is the funny side of it .
For a long time , we in Europe felt that we knew where we were going .
Today , he has chosen not to use the same words .
This would be a missed opportunity for us .
It must be launched at Nice .
There is a lot one can agree with .
Ought the EU really to be devoting itself to those kinds of issue ?
Where exactly does the EU stand ?
This is an issue to which Mr Cox also referred .
To conclude , I would point to one instance of unilateral action which is worrying .
Was it right to do this off its own bat , without checking what the other Member States thought ?
What was the reason for its action ?
Global warming is one such problem .
Like a sword of Damocles , it hangs over not only the Union , but over the whole world .
Integrating this essential factor into all European policies is the political challenge to which we must respond .
Since then we have dawdled and dragged our feet over the reform of these institutions .
Today , the French Presidency has an obligation to achieve results .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the French Presidency is going to be a particularly busy one .
However , not enough progress is being made at the IGC .
President Prodi reiterated these points .
We support these proposals .
It is greatly to the President ' s credit that he used words which sometimes tend to divide us .
That is precisely the problem with several words that are used in the current debate .
The same applies to the word " constitution " , which can also evoke quite different things .
This depends on what you mean .
To some extent , we already have a constitution , which consists of the Treaties .
To some extent , therefore , they form a " constitution " .
Mr Pasqua defined the constitution as the foundation of a new legal order .
Is this not precisely what we have founded in Europe ?
First , it must be more readable and easier to use by consumers , i.e. the general public .
We must also look at the changes we need to make to our constitution .
This is not really a question of creating a hard core .
These are the two crucial points for the IGC .
Concentrate on these and above all , do so before enlargement .
Do this at Nice then , and not afterwards .
Due to time restrictions , I will only refer to three points .
Firstly , closer cooperation and integration .
Secondly , the existing institutions must be used , not replaced with new bodies .
We are leaving it for the future .
Is the ratification process in certain countries not going to jeopardise this ?
I leave that question open .
I will end here .
Also , decisions need to be taken on the Court of Justice and the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
As far as the latter is concerned , it is vital that we tackle the Union ' s structure .
Both Mr Joschka Fischer and President Chirac are right in this .
I am not averse to a federal structure for the European Union .
It could even be termed confederation , as President Chirac said earlier today .
It would be far better to convert the European Council of Ministers to a kind of Federal Council .
All we need to do is to turn the European Council into a senate .
Some see it as an opportunity and some as a threat .
This presidency is being held against the backdrop of a vast movement , which has two components .
It is quite clear that , in the wider debate on this issue , there are two phases .
Here I am talking about a Europe of thirty Members .
Let us focus on the task in hand .
Let us see this IGC through with ambition .
In doing so we will have established the basis which will enable us to move further towards European construction .
What will we be doing , specifically in this IGC ?
Our position is quite clear .
Our obligation concerns the means , not the outcome .
At the same time , however , the French Presidency considers all these things to be connected .
That is why we will be changing our working methods .
Beyond these issues lies that of the European Union ' s constitutional prospects .
Member States will also have to study this document , which inevitably raises many questions .
We should really stop endlessly trying to keep the debate on Strasbourg alive .
Instead , we should concentrate on the practical , material aspects of the issue .
We are anxious to see improved air connections to Strasbourg .
We hope that we will have a large response .
Thank you very much .
( The sitting was suspended at 2 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Delegation of EU observers at the Zimbabwean elections
Zimbabwe is experiencing a serious economic , social and political crisis .
Legislative elections were therefore a major issue for the ruling party .
The vote-counting processes were not cause for controversy either .
Zimbabwe has undoubtedly turned a new page in its young history .
The fundamental problems still remain , of course , and they remain intact .
They have all done a magnificent job .
Zimbabwe is plainly at a crossroads .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Patten
I am therefore looking forward to hearing Commissioner Nielson ' s opinion .
They have managed to do excellent work under very difficult conditions .
The result of these elections offers the EU a new opportunity for reviewing our cooperation with Zimbabwe .
Its main sectors of cooperation are agriculture , health and education .
It can thus now go ahead .
Hopefully this will change .
This programme is to be financed from the EUR 33 million in the 8th EDF second tranche .
In any event the European Commission is continuing to support poverty alleviation schemes .
Thank you very much for your kind words .
To a certain extent our strategy proved to be right .
People did vote in great numbers .
Violence and intimidation did not seem to scare them off from the polling stations .
Many also openly showed their sympathies for the opposition parties .
Allow me now to summarise our conclusions and recommendations in four points :
I am glad to hear that both the presidency and the Commission also take this line .
Add to that our 14 heads of mission who will be on red alert .
The mission can also be seen as an efficient conflict-prevention exercise .
Our mission was an act of commitment to the people in Africa and to democracy worldwide .
The elections in Zimbabwe have been both a victory and a defeat for Mugabe .
However , he has also confused the factors within his own country .
It is probably a combination of both things .
In this area , the opposition also has a role to play .
We must give decisive support to its future .
I pay great tribute to him .
This is a grave problem which be traced directly back to the leadership .
Threats of violence against supporters of the MDC have continued after the elections .
The Archbishop of Bulawayo has been threatened .
All these things must be stopped .
We cannot possibly support a regime that carries on this intimidation .
What Zimbabwe needs is much more inward investment from outside the country .
This will not take place under the present regime .
We should take direct action against assets that President Mugabe owns outside of Zimbabwe .
We must take the argument directly to the man who has created the problems .
This is probably one of the things we should give the Mugabe government credit for during its early years .
On the other hand , it requires transparency in decision making and the flow of information .
Only in this way can democracy preserve its self-remedying nature .
They also augur extremely well for the European Union ' s future cooperation with that country .
There are many things that now seem possible or , in any event , easier , between us .
The electoral situation was particularly tense , not to say violent .
The mission must continue its work on the ground , as Mr Schori requested .
It is now time to forge ahead in conjunction with Zimbabwe .
The Council Presidency fully supports the Commission ' s analysis of the need to cooperate with Zimbabwe .
Community funds must now be released , as Commissioner Nielsen suggested .
Thank you very much , Minister
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon .
Trafficking in human beings
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on trafficking in human beings .
Minister , you are in the fortunate position of being able to start your speech immediately .
We also know that illegal immigrants from the Balkans are under the protection of Albanian mafias .
We must therefore combat these smugglers first of all .
The Council is determined to implement all necessary measures to combat this odious trafficking .
This body has succeeded in breaking up and halting the activities of around fifteen criminal networks per year .
The first point involves taking account of the situation in the countries of origin .
Illegal immigration and the trafficking in human beings are not inevitable , however .
They can be combated by means of a firm political will .
The French Presidency has already proposed four initiatives to the Council .
The proposed text provides for a minimum fine of EUR 2000 .
This text will therefore play an important role in more effectively curbing the traffic in human beings .
This is another important tool in the fight against illegal immigration .
France is paying close attention to the work currently being undertaken by the Commission .
We must also rapidly attain the objective of a fair and efficient asylum system in Europe .
Unfortunately , however , they do exist .
Every year , about half a million people are smuggled into the European Union .
In the port of Dover alone , hundreds of illegal aliens are arrested on a daily basis .
Traffickers demand astronomical amounts to smuggle their customers to the West .
It is clear that traffickers in human beings are becoming more professional in their activities .
And organised crime is exploiting that situation .
Enlargement of the European Union would merely aggravate the problem .
The new countries are , due to their location , extremely vulnerable to the trafficking in human beings .
Unfortunately they are nothing new .
I believe that we have the responsibility to establish a legal framework which will allow this to be done .
A year ago in October , the Tampere agreements were adopted .
In that case they will have the support of this Parliament .
It is high time we adopted policy .
So what should we do ? Minister Queyranne and Commissioner Vitorino already mentioned it .
But I would like to point out something else .
When they meet in Nice , they could abolish the right of veto in European justice policy .
This is why it is necessary to set up a European Public Prosecutor ' s department in this field .
Mr President , there has been enough talk .
It is time for action !
If governments are serious about combating trafficking , these are three areas they need to think about .
I welcome what we have heard about that this afternoon .
I , like all of you , am deeply shocked .
This crime , however , is a daily occurrence at European Union borders .
Fourteen Kurds died of asphyxiation in the hold of a burning ship in Patras .
Dozens of Albanians and Tunisians die en route to Italy .
These are terrifying figures .
How then , can we put an end to this ?
That is the question .
The trade in smuggling human beings is undeniably flourishing .
All of these factors have simply created new forms of illegal immigration .
( The President cut the speaker off )
We do not wish to fall into this trap .
So what is to be done ?
Mr President , we have a problem : we are not moving with events .
We are here today for the 58 victims of Dover .
All of this is interconnected .
Anything else is mere verbiage and preaching .
This appalling incident was avoidable .
Accordingly , they alerted the port authorities at Dover .
I thank the Minister for his genuine and honest statement .
We must do more to support the countries from which these people came and improve the conditions there .
And their prospects ?
Minister , Commissioner , you have truly disappointed me .
You are not even following the line taken at the Tampere Council .
Everyone will complain and Europe will not have made any progress .
Realistic in the sense that practice and theory are two different things .
This entails reception and a document entitling them to walk around freely .
And the Chinese must be able to speak out .
I have experienced this first hand .
I know of Chinese girls whose faces have been slashed with knives .
They are scarred for life .
They cannot go back .
I think that for certain people , the situation is more complex than that .
I would like to finish off with a comment on the police forces .
I call on you to provide them with the necessary resources for they are fighting a one-sided war .
Yet immigration from regions near and far is part and parcel of the history of Europe .
The European Parliament looks forward to being consulted on these initiatives .
But these are not enough .
How long will it take for governments to realize that they have no clothes in this matter ?
I am pleased to hear that Canada is among the countries invited to the presidency 's seminar .
We might be advised to take a leaf out of Canada 's book .
I think that this would be unrealistic .
Under our Presidency , we have the opportunity to build on the proposals presented in this debate .
First of all , I should like to state the Commission ' s position on the Tampere programme .
I therefore understand why Mr Ducarme should say that he feels disappointed .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Vitorino .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday , at 12 noon .
1998 discharge ( continuation )
The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on the 1998 discharge .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Schreyer .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Wednesday , at 12 noon .
It was better because it was more rigorous , more transparent and more rational .
I would like to highlight what I think are the two most relevant points .
The concept of relationships with nature is changing radically in our own time .
In future we will not be able to subordinate this relationship to profit , selfishness and exploitation .
It is undeniably important for LIFE to be adopted .
LIFE III will therefore be operational before the summer .
Congratulations to the rapporteur .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 .
2001 budget ( conciliation procedure )
The Commission has submitted a second preliminary draft on which the agricultural sector would certainly like to comment .
There are also a few other issues which have struck me .
We need to try to use the budget efficiently .
Can Europe ' s rural environment count on adequate care and financial means ?
Our committee tabled two amendments for the report .
Amendment No 20 concerns innovative measures .
The appropriation must be kept at the level decided at Berlin .
The importance of innovation was stressed both at the Lisbon and Feira summits .
Innovation must therefore be adequately supported .
The Commission and the Member States should also simplify and speed up administration procedures relating to Structural Funds .
More attention should be paid to the success of projects at approval stage .
. Mr President , I begin by endorsing the plaudits that have been offered to Mrs Haug .
Therefore we have prepared the opinion which is before Parliament .
I will briefly touch on some of the points that arise from it .
It is a matter that has been of significant concern to the Industry Committee .
We are particularly concerned about the implications for a wide range of the programmes that fall within our remit .
In two particular areas we are affected by multiannual programmes .
I want to reiterate our commitment in the research area .
That is only just now coming through .
I hope the Commissioner will take that on board .
Firstly , I will refer to our contribution to the international organisations .
My second point concerns the international agreements .
But we maintain a sense of realism .
No more , no less .
We are aware of the broad support we enjoy in this Parliament .
The way this discharge is currently organised leaves a great deal to be desired .
With our help , the Commission would like to change tack .
This results in a classification according to DAC sectors .
So we have reached a stage in the clarification process when " wait and see " stance is appropriate .
In the meantime , we need to know more about certain fundamental issues , such as :
information on how it is intended to finance the common security and defence policy .
I congratulate Mrs Haug on her fine work .
If you look at the Haug report , Parliament wants to find a solution .
Let us get that point clear .
We are not looking for confrontation , we are actually looking for a way of cooperating together .
They have failed to do that .
On two occasions we have asked them for trialogues and we have been refused .
That makes it pretty difficult .
I am pretty sure Parliament has a position now .
Mr President , firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Haug , for her excellent report .
Its total value is EUR 5.5 billion .
The Commission ' s proposal for the CARDS programme is explicit and our group supports it .
Military action is always an extreme measure , and somebody must always suffer the consequences .
This is stated in point 3 of Mrs Haug ' s report .
The CARDS programme is so huge that it is impossible to adapt it to the present financial perspectives .
The Council is responsible for the reconstruction of the Balkans .
Mr President , Mrs Haug is rapporteur in a novel situation .
My groups welcomes this development .
The Commission ' s initiative is necessary in order to finance the Stability Pact for the Balkans .
This request has not yet been met - or so it seems , which is detrimental .
Mr President , spectrum auctions are pushing up profits in Member States in a manner never before seen .
That will clarify the context in which discharge is granted .
Furthermore , the granting of discharge must also concern a common foreign and security policy .
This must stop .
Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur on her report .
Furthermore , we have the problem of the European Councils .
This is logical , since he is also chairman of the Committee on Budgets .
It is clear that nobody is managing to give a reliable estimate of what is needed in Kosovo .
Ladies and gentlemen , the Interinstitutional Agreement is something this House must maintain .
This is almost a carbon copy of the procedure for the 2000 budget .
The Council ' s short-sightedness hinders any logical solution .
Somehow or other , the Commission has honoured its commitment to propose a multi-annual plan for the Balkans .
That is no way to make progress .
Our contribution to the campaign against Pinochet in the referendum was EUR 10 million .
Let us not push things to the limit .
Ladies and Gentlemen , I do not know if the Council is aware of the real situation .
Mr President , I am grateful for this opportunity to make some general comments about the 2001 Budget .
That concludes the joint debate .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Question Time ( Council )
Question No 1 by ( H-0518 / 00 ) :
Rest assured that the French Presidency will scrupulously adhere to such provisions .
In this way we shall be able to keep the European Parliament informed of defence-related matters .
Thank you , Minister , for your first response during your presidency .
I am especially pleased that we are able to see Mr Richard here .
We shall then be able to determine the various views on this matter .
I am very pleased to see the President-in-Office here , as a former Member of Parliament .
So does he agree that codecision is the way forward in this policy area ?
Mr Newton Dunn , I stand by my previous response .
Question No 2 by ( H-0519 / 00 ) :
The water is apparently intended to be used to develop irrigated intensive farming in Catalonia .
This scheme goes against all principles of sustainable management of water resources at the regional level .
Is the Council aware of this scheme ?
It was adopted recently through a conciliation procedure on 29 June 2000 .
To be honest I have nothing further to add to my previous responses .
Question No 3 by ( H-0525 / 00 ) :
Mr President , I am disappointed with that response .
Yet that same spectrum would , of course , be very profitable if were used for telephone communications .
In other words , I repeat , the Council continues to approach the issue openly .
Question No 4 by ( H-0531 / 00 ) :
Mr President , first of all let me congratulate Mr Moscovici on his country winning Euro 2000 .
As to your answer , I disagree with its contents .
I believe the response of the EU in Geneva was appalling .
It was cowardice to the highest degree that we failed to support the US initiative .
Question No 5 by Ioannis Souladakis ( H-0536 / 00 ) :
Subject : Improvement in the export capacities of the countries of South-Eastern Europe
That is the question .
That is the nub of the problem .
Question No 6 by ( H-0539 / 00 ) :
The European Union urges the Iraqi Government to cooperate fully with the UN and its supporting bodies .
As a result , the embargo imposed on Iraq remains in force .
The Iraqi Government is chiefly responsible for this .
I asked the question because there is a certain sensitivity in France to this issue .
This is the difficult path we must now take .
Mr President , I have submitted a similar question , Question No 20 .
I consider that unacceptable , it is not my responsibility .
We have doubled infant mortality due to the lack of drugs .
This is neither France ' s nor the Council ' s position .
The Council has decided not to answer them .
Question No 7 by Esko Olavi Seppänen ( H-0542 / 00 ) :
Subject : Non-allied status of certain EU Member States
Some EU Member States do not belong to the NATO military alliance .
There is no problem between Parliament and the Commission .
This was reiterated in the presidency ' s report that was approved by the Helsinki European Council .
Mr President , at the meeting at Feira it was decided to increase flexibility .
Is yours the same interpretation ?
Question No 8 by ( H-0545 / 00 ) :
My intention here is to simply give a few brief details .
You have demonstrated this in your reply .
Question No 9 by ( H-0552 / 00 ) :
Are Professor Pelinka 's remarks not completely within the bounds of acceptability in a democracy ?
My response to that will be extremely brief .
Mr President , I would thank the French presidency for its succinct answer .
My second question concerns Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty , concerning fundamental rights .
Does the President-in-Office of the Council know of any similar , or better , legislation in other States ?
Are bilateral decisions not to be dealt with by the Council in future ?
( inaudible ) on the French Presidency ' s ability to understand languages other than French .
We are not all uneducated and illiterate .
These are short-term teething troubles .
. ( FR ) I think there is some ambiguity surrounding this issue .
Question No 11 by Maj Britt Theorin ( H-0554 / 00 ) :
Subject : International Criminal Court
However , to become a reality , the Rome Statute must be ratified by 60 States .
At this rate , it is doubtful whether we shall meet our December deadline .
Russia and the United States are important in this connection .
Question No 12 by ( H-0556 / 00 ) :
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I truly regret your reply .
I was merely giving you a progress report .
Question No 16 by ( H-0565 / 00 ) :
I thank the Minister although , unfortunately , I do not consider his answer satisfactory .
I had understood the question perfectly .
Question No 17 by ( H-0569 / 00 ) :
I wish you every success .
I am also suffering .
These summer colds need a lot of attention .
That concludes Questions to the Council .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.45 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. ) .
Draft supplementary and amending budgets ( SAB ) for 2000
The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports :
The Council ' s budget is EUR 6.635 million .
This building will be for the needs of the staff required to implement the policy .
Their pay will amount to EUR 758 000 by the end of the year .
This will reduce annual interest by EUR 2.2 million over a ten-year period .
This will leave a margin in the financial perspectives of EUR 69.1 million .
It is only reasonable that the European Parliament should pay for its office space ahead of time .
We shall need this , as , with eastward enlargement , Parliament ' s other expenses will increase .
The scars left behind in Kosovo , after the crisis management operation , are frightening .
How justified is humanitarian military action , and what are its limits ?
A big problem will be future budget technology .
And no-one wants that .
Mr President , I shall endeavour to act on your good advice .
For Parliament this represents a limited victory but a significant one nonetheless .
In the second place , we have made several decisions that can be viewed in a positive light .
Thanks to the legal basis that now exists we are able to fund these orphan drugs .
Once again , the legal bases exist to make these possible .
It is therefore expenditure that has been secured by a sacrifice that barely costs us anything .
The third significant element relates to the financing of the special aid for Montenegro .
We need 20 million .
We are spending funds economically , that is our main job .
We are handling funds properly , and that too is our main job .
This was a topic which we were able to focus on this morning .
Allow me to make one comment to the Council .
We too shall , of course , be voting in favour of the two reports .
The Council has the enviable task of being able to claw back and budget EUR 3.2 billion .
The figure of 200 million will then probably be discussed elsewhere .
My request to the Council is : bear this in mind , including for the forthcoming negotiations .
That would , of course , enable us to change the whole modus operandi between us in the future .
I think that would help to defuse individual budget debates .
I should like to address another two parts of the supplementary budget .
However , we must find this 20 million by squeezing the margin dry .
We cannot use the 3.2 billion ; instead we must squeeze the margin dry .
That would be a good sign and could shape the forthcoming budget debates .
I would like to raise three issues about this .
They would more appropriately come under the heading of operational expenditure .
I believe this has been pushed to its limit .
The Council 's interpretation of the gentlemen 's agreement is certainly imaginative .
That will surely be as safe as Fort Knox .
The first proposed amending budget relates to the Commission 's budget .
If new tasks are to be adopted , then they need to be given staffing and administrative support .
For Montenegro , additional aid of EUR 20 million is to be provided .
Thank you , Commissioner .
Thank you .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon .
Liberalisation of energy markets
The committee has identified a number of points here , which I should like to list .
We advise that this implementation be accelerated .
We want to ensure that this remains the case .
My fourth point concerns regulators .
Fifthly , the grids are the central market place for the markets .
A model has been worked out here whereby the costs of cross-border trade are paid into funds .
Commissioner , Madam Vice-president , I have two comments to make on this .
We need to examine these costings closely in order to ensure that they are not completely out of line .
That is an important point in this process .
Sixthly : not all cross-border services have the necessary capacity .
Then there are two more points which I should like to address .
Energy , of course , is not just any good or service .
It is very basic and very essential and has to be treated differently from normal goods .
For that reason they were not full speed ahead directives .
I have said that the job losses were very considerable .
There has been a diminution in the amount of research and development and that is a shame .
The question of public service obligations is mentioned several times in the report .
I hope that will be supported .
However there are environmental implications which we have not taken very seriously .
It is up to them to decide .
That is not easy to do and it is something the Parliament holds dear .
That needs to be rectified very quickly .
Two major factors can be identified with regard to the liberalisation process of the energy market .
I welcome proposals for network access for renewable energies .
This is currently something that we should be concerned about .
Yet the Commission is not tackling this head on .
Perhaps it is afraid .
I have discussed this with Commissioner Monti .
Yes , I am aware of the few positive developments in European energy policy .
Without doubt , electricity prices have fallen .
Such facts do not fit in with liberalisation mania .
Mr President , I would like to convey my congratulations to the rapporteur for this report .
It is a very balanced piece of work covering quite a wide range of views .
St Augustine ' make me more liberalised but not quite yet ' .
Private sector provision has delivered the goods .
I do not favour price reduction over security .
Firstly , the value of strong regulatory authorities .
Secondly , the value of a timetable .
It was a pity that the Lisbon conclusions did not call for a timetable .
By what mechanism does he hope this will be achieved , or rather by what mysterious means ?
Everywhere you look employees rights are under threat .
I take issue with another assertion made in the report concerning the reduction in energy prices .
Who will benefit from this and how exactly ?
It is commonly known that tariff reductions all too often only benefit large industrial users .
Energy is a basic need .
Access to it must therefore be considered a fundamental right .
That is the first thing .
Mr Caudron , it is no longer possible to reverse this and that is how it should be .
Secondly , the energy liberalisation sceptics have been impressively routed .
It has improved thanks to international competition .
We still have a whole series of problems to solve .
Mr Mombaur pointed that out just now .
Thirdly , we need the strict division between energy generation and grid management .
Both mergers and state aid must be controlled and approved in the future .
Professor Monti has announced this .
I do not think that it , in fact , is .
This entails major upheavals which are causing concern among employees .
That is just the problem with this issue .
It may perhaps be concluded that what we have obtained is liberalisation for liberalisation ' s sake .
It is therefore right to continue with the liberalisation that is under way and implement complete liberalisation .
There is a wide range of considerations to be taken into account .
Mr President , I would like to thank my colleague , Mr Mombaur , for an excellent report .
In addition , the largest European " energy players " must fall into line .
What does such a competitive country have to fear in conditions of free competition ?
The Commission must reconsider its position .
Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on an excellent report .
The liberalisation of energy markets is an essential factor in the development of the economy .
It also highlights some of the key facts in this matter , two of which I shall mention here .
In fact , it appears that France comes bottom of the class as far as this matter is concerned .
However , the benefits have outweighed the problems encountered .
This does not mean that there is not a strong will to move forward .
We must not create fifteen separate liberalised markets , but one single European liberalised market .
Furthermore , the efforts of the Florence Forum are invaluable and we must continue along that route .
Both of these reflect an original institutional approach , since representatives of Parliament participate in them .
I consider water to be a form of renewable energy , of course .
Hydro-electricity is a form of renewable energy .
We believe that we have to support renewable energy sources as much as possible .
We must continue to include it within the broad consideration of renewable energy resources .
Mr President , I do not have time to expand further .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Community railway undertakings
The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports :
We still have a long debate ahead of us .
I beg you to keep to the speaking times .
We are most grateful for that .
The Council wants to move one small step at a time .
So what are our most important proposed amendments ?
Another factor is the question of track charges .
And we shall only get it if we adopt a clear stance here in Parliament .
We talk about globalisation .
It also means that there can be no derogations .
Secondly , we have differing views on the compulsory separation of infrastructures .
We feel that the individual Member States should be given room to manoeuvre and take decisions here .
The pricing system is an important issue .
How much should be charged for the capacity allocated ?
There are two schools of thought here .
Is everything to be run on market principles , on private-sector principles ?
I am sure that tomorrow 's vote will set a conciliation procedure in motion .
That does not present any particular problem .
We , the two rapporteurs , and all the groups in the House are willing to reach a compromise .
But the Council must also show willing .
Allow me to say that they both explained the technical aspects of their reports extremely well .
The first conclusion concerns the liberalisation of the railways .
The second message concerns the Council .
The Council needs to take serious account of Parliament 's views .
They either have to change or die .
Railways in Europe are in terminal decline , not least in the rail freight sector .
New freight goes by road in Europe , not by rail .
That must change , and I believe it will .
The alternative to this modest step is no step at all .
We have to take into account national differences and indeed , social and employment concerns .
Those basic safeguards must be restored .
That is an achievable goal .
Let us not throw it away .
I do not really share Mr Watts ' view .
In my opinion , we need to go further than the Council stated in its common position .
This step is also the step currently proposed by the Council .
First of all , it is vital that infrastructure and the provision of services be divided .
After all , no one can be on both sides of the fence at the same time .
Secondly , who can apply for a licence ?
Not only railway undertakings , others too should be able to do this .
I cannot see why , Mr Swoboda , this should be postponed until 2010 .
In my opinion , we should be able to bring this date forward to 2005 .
I would like to add a brief , technical comment .
They are all in need of considerable modernisation in order to offer identical conditions of competition .
The compromise reached on 10 December by the Transport Council marked a step in the right direction .
Let us therefore go ahead and set up the rail transport network .
This rail package was the subject of a Council compromise in December .
However , we are faced with an ultraliberal proposition at this second reading .
In my view , rail transport would be left with an enormous bill .
History has taught us that excessive interference by governments has hampered the necessary flexibility .
In addition , some improvements are needed within the sector itself as well .
A division of tasks is necessary in order to prevent the unfair treatment of different economic operators .
Finally , this sector would also benefit from transparency and decisiveness .
The fewer bodies involved , the better .
I speak for my own country of Ireland .
It is a small country isolated from the European mainland .
Only now is there a chance for them to develop and prosper .
European railways therefore need to open up urgently and without fear .
The Swoboda report contains commendable proposals regarding the need to adapt legislation to the various national situations .
Fulfilling both of these objectives requires a delicate balance to be struck .
I believe it could send out the wrong signals .
The liberalisation of this sector must under no circumstances be an obstacle to this access .
We therefore harbour grave reservations about supporting these directives .
I could not agree more .
But this is about the only issue on which I see eye to eye with him .
I believe Mr Jarzembowski is quite mistaken .
His proposals are in line with views held at the end of the twentieth century .
The rapporteur considers the rail industry as an irritating state monopoly with difficult and demanding trade unions in tow .
He wants to break this monopoly as quickly and radically as possible .
We have now gained some experience in liberalisation thanks to the English and Dutch models .
In other regions , they remained a monopoly .
That country now invests less in innovation than any other country .
Trains are shorter and overloaded , and the safety of railways has declined .
Mr President , ten years ago , Mr Cornelissen found himself in exactly the same debate .
If I were to read out his text , nobody would bat an eyelid .
The train is at a standstill , and to stand still is to regress .
Who in their right mind would take a train that moved backwards ?
So far , trains have not contributed in any way .
In the next phase , the following points will be particularly important , in my opinion .
Honest , non-discriminatory access should be granted to the infrastructure .
Transport companies should be separated from the management of the infrastructure .
It is vital for these components not to be controlled by one and the same body .
Liberalisation , as mentioned in the common position , is a good start but is not enough .
Liberalisation should , however , work both ways .
Either you are very famous or your correspondents feel very strongly about the matter on which they write .
Who can argue with that ?
The figures speak for themselves .
Every example in related sectors confirms the argument .
One step at a time gets you nowhere .
And we expect the same to happen with the railways .
It is fashionable these days to talk about the railways ; it is politically correct .
It often feels as if Parliament is a chamber where there is just one permitted truth .
It is hard for us politicians to admit the facts .
By far the biggest is road transport .
So let us forget dogma , examples of which I have heard here tonight .
Ladies and gentlemen , I wish to tell the two rapporteurs that I like their amendments very much .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Recognition of professional qualifications
Doctors are a sensitive issue , human health is a very sensitive issue .
If I have a car accident , I can quantify and repair the damage .
It is time for improvements here .
Thirdly : the Committee on Legal Affairs is calling for greater focus on continuing training .
I should like to address one more point .
Two other amendments have been proposed concerning Irish architects .
The PPE-DE group - my group - intends to withdraw its amendment here .
I would recommend that the House also reject the amendment along these lines proposed by the UEN .
The single market is one of the great achievements of the European Community .
In my view systems of mutual recognition are more attractive .
They are after all more subtle and sophisticated .
I hope that plenary shares its views and will vote in favour by a large majority .
Thank you for listening .
These are important points although they are not controversial among us .
This is extremely important .
I am very happy to support this report .
And the situation is all the more serious if we consider the unemployment levels in Europe .
All individuals have the right for their studies to be recognised .
But the devil is in the detail .
We now realise that in fact every job description needs to be regulated .
But people no longer understand this .
Is this a citizens ' Europe ?
Is this a common market ?
These are the questions .
We need to start by finding similarities in training and curricula .
Procedures for recognising diplomas acquired in third countries must also be simplified .
All too often they are unjustly denied recognition , which places them in an intolerable position .
The cost of the validation process also warrants discussion .
More specifically , the proposal for a directive contains some interesting provisions with regard to clarification .
Their approval would contravene the rules governing technical legislation and the interinstitutional agreement that exists in this context .
Amendments Nos 12 and 13 are , in fact , not new .
This concludes my response .
I thank you for the opportunity you have given me to expand on this matter .
Commissioner , allow me to thank you for being both brief and to the point .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
( The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m. )
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Mr Moscovici replied to the question and to Mr Marino 's supplementary question and Mr Zacharakis then intervened " .
I should like a reply on this and I should like the Minutes to be corrected .
It is true that it would be opportune to review the Question Time procedures from time to time .
I shall look into this .
Mr Zacharakis , we will not be holding the political debate on this issue here .
Mr Moscovici took the floor yesterday and we will check whether this was included correctly in the Minutes .
( The Minutes were approved )
If it was , then it should not be distributed as an official document .
I shall enquire at the services into the exact course of events .
I asked the secretariat of the Committee on Budgetary Control to draft a letter to that effect .
Because we were sitting in the evening , that was no longer possible .
The situation in Ireland is quite contrary to this principle .
This issue is now before the courts in Ireland .
Mr President , I would like to put a question to Parliament .
They are very sad happenings indeed .
ECB annual report
I should therefore like to comment on the possible emergence of a new economy in the euro area .
Let me start by noting that there are various definitions of the new economy .
An inappropriately lax monetary policy would not create better conditions for the emergence of a new economy .
These are also as a rule made available to the public via the ECB 's website .
We therefore avoid the delays that are inherent in the publication of all forms of official minutes .
We always take our decisions from a euro area-wide perspective .
This is fundamental to the conduct of a truly single monetary policy .
The resolution also calls for the publication of macroeconomic forecasts by the ECB .
Let me reassure you that preparations for publication continue in earnest .
I should like , however , to sound a note of caution .
Forecasts are only one input into the decisions of the governing council .
Forecasts themselves have important shortcomings .
We are aware of these shortcomings .
The ECB 's approach to communication has always placed a premium on honesty .
Any other approach would not be transparent and would therefore be potentially misleading .
I now turn to a related issue , namely the publication of the ECB 's economic and econometric models .
The results obtained from the models are critically evaluated , using expert judgement .
The respective authors are responsible for the content of these papers .
Therefore they do not necessarily reflect the view of the ECB or of the Eurosystem .
Several econometric models have already been published in the working paper series of the ECB .
Other models will be published in the near future .
Secondly , the introduction of the euro itself has fostered further integration of the banking and financial sector .
The report called on the banking sector to provide substantially improved services by 2002 .
Since the publication of that report the banking sector has subscribed to the Eurosystem 's objectives in principle .
I fully share the European Parliament 's concern that very little progress has been visible to customers .
Mr Karas will be dealing with that point in detail later on .
Mr Duisenberg , I would like to sincerely congratulate both the ECB and you personally on that .
If the policies of the ECB are to be successful , it must be politically independent .
We need to counter that trend here today .
That is why it is important for the ECB to tailor its decisions to primary objectives .
The areas of economic growth and employment are primarily a matter for the Member States .
This is exactly the reason for part of the weak external value of the euro .
The Member States have got to take action themselves here .
For banks simply to refer to the standardisation of systems is not enough here .
The introduction of the euro did not come overnight and it was not a surprise .
I myself come from the world of information and communications technology .
Lastly , I would like to talk about the imminent eastward enlargement of the European Union .
What I have in mind is to examine the process ahead of us .
We must maintain this process - this scope for interpretation .
What caused this initial drop in the exchange rate ?
Secondly , the euro is a new currency .
A new currency has to win the confidence that other currencies already enjoy .
Over here , the upper limit is set at 2 % , and for very good reasons .
You spoke just now about new technology , about the new economy .
First , the 1999 annual report .
I think that was an achievement which deserves to be highlighted .
As far as the current year is concerned , the figures are not quite as pleasing .
Nonetheless , the Central Bank 's strategy has not always been completely clear or highly legible .
Inflation is there , sure enough , Mr Duisenberg !
I hope to see better coordination between European policies .
Allow me to say just two words on Mr Radwan 's comments .
Every country which is to join the European Union should be a member of the Economic and Monetary Union .
We want to apply the Treaty , but the whole Treaty and nothing but the Treaty .
Those are the main points I would like to make .
( The President cut the speaker off )
The much-vaunted new economy will certainly not serve the interests of the workers .
His efforts are commendable .
One can understand why the child is sickly , under the circumstances .
With no such foundation , the Central Bank is not independent , it is isolated .
Its message is doomed to failure .
Perhaps your euro will rally , Mr Duisenberg , but it will not be thanks to you .
It will be because the dollar has fallen .
However , we cannot allow this result to distract us from the many storm clouds gathering overhead .
It is a question of structural reforms and must be dealt with as such .
There is a problem of privatisation and liberalisation in many sectors .
There is the problem of the flexibility of the labour market .
However , more could be done to improve the transparency of monetary policy .
After all , the rate of inflation is low and under control despite the increase in oil prices .
This is very different to the situation prevailing at the time of the oil crisis in the 1970s .
After all , money exists to serve people , and not the other way round .
After all , full employment is once again a possibility at last .
What contribution can the ECB make , and does it intend to make ?
Firstly , what conditions must Denmark fulfil before the ECB will intervene in support of the krone ?
Thirdly , for how long a period will the ECB be prepared to support the krone ?
However , the real and very fundamental criticisms I want to make relate to other areas .
The report welcomes the improvement in the ECB ' s information policy .
But the ECB is not privately owned .
There is a second problem that worries me .
Yes , and why not ?
There is a second problem that worries me .
Lastly , I wish to raise a third question , which I will at least touch upon .
There is not a word in the report about the unparalleled over-expansion of international speculative financial markets .
( Applause )
I had three principal aims in mind with those amendments .
Firstly , to enhance and underscore the independence of the European Central Bank .
Theirs was no easy task .
This attitude towards economic policy verges on the dangerous , especially nowadays .
This hike follows on from the increase in American rates .
To do so , social and monetary sides must join forces .
But the ECB is the only master on board when it comes to monetary policy .
It advocates wage restraint , flexibility and job insecurity .
It fans the flames of privatisation in order to boost competitiveness and the return on capital .
We cannot merely tack a social chapter on to neo-liberal economic policy .
The sheer nonsense that we have heard here demonstrates how important the ECB ' s independence is .
I would like to have seen all these points included in the report .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Independence , yes , but independence in relation to what ?
This revision would appear to be overdue .
Allow me to share my conviction with you .
The lack of any real coordination between our economic policies is the main cause .
I hope that the French presidency will succeed in pushing this issue forward .
I also hope that the Central Bank will help it to do so in a positive spirit .
Progress has been made as regards transparency and we are delighted about that .
You know that this Parliament imagines that we can go further still .
And then , Mr President , allow me to question you on one final point .
You have called on the trade unions for wage restraint , as is your right .
( Applause )
The elected members of Lutte Ouvrière will be voting against this report .
The report we are now dealing with also shows that progress was clearly made in this direction last year .
There has to be more transparency , however .
Could you comment on that later on in your reply ?
This is also important .
Mr President , Mr President of the European Central Bank , good work !
I take a rather more pessimistic view than the previous speaker .
We have seen the external value of the euro plummet .
The interesting issue is to look at why that fall has happened .
They do not believe in a currency which is not backed by a political institution or a government .
The one follows almost inevitably from the other .
That is one of the many reasons why the United Kingdom should stay out of the euro .
Too often in the past they have been told that changes in Europe are technical .
I trust that we will vote in accordance with that in the Karas report at noon today .
If the single currency is not working , why are so many countries seeking to join the new structure ?
I welcome the decision to allow Greece full participation within the single currency .
In the Scandinavian countries support for the single currency is rising .
Of course we are waiting anxiously for the decision of the Danish people .
From an Irish perspective , I believe that our cash changeover plan is moving very well .
We want to ensure that the mistakes that were made then are not made again .
There are a few points I would like to comment on .
Mrs Berès has asked a very precise question , about which I would like to say the following .
I do not understand the pessimism which permeates this aspect of the debate .
Unemployment will fall over the next two years .
The question was asked what will the ECB do if that creates problems for Denmark ?
A week later the entire statement is produced again in a more final form .
Thank you , Mr Duisenberg .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
Implementation of EMU
We have talked a lot about the advantages of the euro and of economic and monetary union .
But there still remains a very great deal to be done .
Most members of the public do not have a euro account and rarely carry out financial transactions in euros .
I would like to use my last one and a half minutes to say something about priorities .
Over half of all SMEs do not yet have an action plan for the changeover .
So SMEs are the priority for autumn 2000 .
Secondly , there is the public at large , which includes all the target groups and more besides .
The public needs to be made to feel secure about this .
Thirdly , we have schools , schoolchildren and other young people .
There are less than 75 weeks to go in fact .
We all need to change over to the euro in our daily lives .
For the reason mentioned , this particularly needs to be brought to the attention of the Council again .
We have to reach grassroots level as swiftly as we can , in a language that is perfectly clear .
I fear those information campaigns that are led by the Commission .
They are often sweet as candy and very beautifully contrived .
It was very successful at that point .
This has not happened during this new parliamentary term .
Some of the procedures dating from the last parliamentary term have still not been discharged to this day .
We therefore have to ask in the clearest possible terms what should happen next .
That is my first point .
Unfortunately , this seems to apply not only to the public , but also to business .
The governments themselves really must do some advance work , however , and demonstrate greater commitment .
I believe that you cannot shift all the responsibility to the European institutions .
The euro must become part of education across the board .
No , this is really a job that needs to be successfully handled at local level .
We should not be deceived by the painless transition on 1 January 1999 .
Nor should we be deceived by the almost automatic transition to the new millennium .
We also need to prepare for the euro psychologically .
We must all do this together , at all levels of the European Union !
In this respect I would like very briefly to highlight three dimensions . The first is decentralisation .
This is an aspect that the European Central Bank and the Commission should bear in mind .
I call on the UK and Scottish governments to play a full part in that campaign .
Mr President , there are three countries outside EMU .
Mr President , I should like to continue where the previous speaker left off .
This report is one of the most interesting documents I have read for a long time .
Or , in a nutshell , manipulation .
That is to say , the Commission is using Europeans ' money to manipulate Europeans .
As I see it , that is the very opposite of how we really visualise this project .
Democracy depends upon decision-making by the people , not upon manipulation by the institutional machine .
We will not be manipulated .
This is a most deplorable report .
We must demonstrate to the European public that the euro will cut administrative costs , to their advantage .
The excessive bank charges in force at present are giving precisely the opposite signal .
In addition , people need to have faith in the process as a whole .
In order to instil this feeling , we must provide them with information as a matter of priority .
Let us not delude people into thinking they will not need to make any sacrifices .
The changeover will require an effort .
Everyone will need to adjust , everyone will need to make an effort .
And this is what the citizens of Europe are waiting for .
Unfortunately , I cannot escape this here , either .
If the cap fits , wear it .
Surely no-one could challenge the need for information .
I certainly wish the euro well .
The debate is suspended . We shall now proceed to the votes .
The debate will be resumed this afternoon .
Färm ( PSE ) , rapporteur .
The help of the EU is required for this .
It is important for this clearing work to be started before the summer .
So my reply is ' yes ' .
( Parliament approved the Commission proposal )
This has also been the case this time .
I also have a longer version of the declaration if the President would like to see it .
Yes or no ?
As I see it , that is the vital question .
. ( FR ) My answer is yes .
( Parliament approved the Commission proposal )
Procedure without debate
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament approved the joint text )
Before the vote :
( The President declared the common position approved as amended )
( The President declared the two common positions approved as amended )
( The President declared the common position approved as amended )
Framework agreement ( C5-0349 / 2000 ) on relations between the European Parliament and the Commission
Before the vote :
Now , the Commission is being given the opportunity to decide what it will hand over for inspection .
It is the same procedure as applies in connection with the ombudsman .
The framework agreement also contravenes our own rules of procedure .
The rapporteurs cannot demand them , and MEPs certainly cannot .
This compromise does not correspond with Mr Prodi ' s pledges .
Mr Bonde is asking for the vote to be postponed .
In our opinion , this is absolutely intolerable .
Madam President , I will have the opportunity later to speak on behalf of my Group .
( Parliament rejected the request to postpone the vote )
My Group called for this framework agreement , and it is very much committed to it .
As legislators we are of course free to set these in train .
This framework agreement is based on the principles of parliamentarism , democracy and transparency .
Parliament is more powerful and must therefore act more responsibly .
In this respect , we believe that we have taken an important step .
The negotiation has been very long .
It was expected that the framework agreement would be concluded in December of last year .
Madam President , it falls to you to conclude .
What we now have to do is adapt our internal regulations to this new reality .
Madam President , that would be a step forward .
There are two points of criticism that my colleagues and my Group have asked to seek clarification on today .
Many of my colleagues are upset that no explicit reference is made to the rights of rapporteurs .
If we include this , then many of my colleagues who have reservations , will vote yes .
My Group is very concerned about the developments that are under way in the Council .
Secondly , we too have a comment for the Council .
We were astonished by the Council ' s intervention .
One final comment : we all heard President Chirac address this House yesterday .
He promised that the Council ' s modus operandi would change in future .
The European Council represents the interests of the fifteen governments of the Union and has very strong legislative powers .
Parliament is a democratically elected legislative body which has the overriding power of supervision over other key institutions .
The negotiations for this framework agreement have been tortuous .
It may not be a perfect document but it is certainly a step forward .
It is more exacting than the agreement that has existed between the two institutions over the past five years .
I would now like to turn to some of the key provisions of the agreement .
Madam President , my Group is to vote against the framework agreement .
I should like to begin by correcting a misunderstanding .
We do not want to prevent the Commission from being able to deliberate in confidence .
The Commission should also be entitled to have confidential drafts on the table throughout the preparative phase .
There are two humiliating situations in particular which we should like to avoid .
In the legislation process , we sit , as we all know , in committees and debate draft bills .
It also often happens that we read in the newspaper about a leaked Commission proposal .
It is a humiliating situation which is completely unacceptable .
When he took up his post , Mr Prodi promised to bring this situation to an end .
What is more , a President might come along to whom one preferred not to kowtow .
The European Parliament is an important body .
I think that we also need transparency in our debates .
I should like , if you will allow me , to make two basic comments .
Mr Lannoye , we cannot open a debate now .
I think that we also need to make a clear distinction ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Madam President , my motion is that we hold a vote on this matter .
The committee which I have the honour to chair examined the STOA report .
There are clear amendments on our order paper today which deal with that point .
I move that we now hold a vote on this matter .
Madam President , I have no intention of opening a debate .
( Parliament adopted the decision )
( Parliament adopted the decision )
I had already brought this to the attention of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs .
The " legal advice " aspect is missing from the English version .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Agreement between the European Union and Cyprus ( C5-0324 / 2000 )
In addition , Cyprus also covers the cost of its participation in other programmes .
The people of Cyprus are clearly being wronged here .
Schmid report ( A5-0176 / 2000 )
Lienemann report ( A5-0172 / 2000 )
Mr President , of course I voted for the motion .
Of course I am in favour of this measure , for I love birds .
LIFE is just a drop in the ocean of European policy .
That aside , is the environment not the only European sector to have shown no real improvement ?
How much longer will we need to repeat this point before anything is done ?
Jarzembowski report ( A5-0173 / 2000 )
I can think of different ways to achieve this .
Accordingly , the root of the problem is different from how the rapporteur sees it .
This is therefore a matter of urgency .
We have been told that liberalising rail transport will give us far more services .
I am against this ultra-liberal logic and was anxious to register my opposition .
He goes far beyond what is proposed in the common position presented by the Council .
At no point does he refer to the risks which radical liberalisation might have in terms of safety .
No one should have ignored these issues in the vote we cast today .
Swoboda report ( A5-0171 / 2000 )
This cooperation should have been sought a long time ago .
In our view , this deletion does not constitute an improvement on the Council ' s position .
Mr President , I voted for the Swoboda report as well .
The States of Europe must assist the least well-off citizens by providing them with free services .
However , we are against total liberalisation of the railways in the form recommended .
We do not want to have a single model imposed on us !
The model of the French railways is also a factor in social cohesion .
- ( SV ) The present increase in haulage in Europe is untenable in the long term .
In order to curb this development , goods transported by road ought to be transferred to the railways .
Fair competition also requires rail fees to be based on the principal of marginal costs .
Wieland report ( A5-0174 / 2000 )
I am referring in particular to the skills of nurses and doctors .
The report states that there are no reliable studies of the problem .
We therefore need to take action quickly so that their qualifications are recognised .
They result from the lack of funds provided to public health services .
We do not realise just how obscure the mechanisms are .
Total legal insecurity is the overriding feature in this area .
As a matter of principle , this is a flagrant violation of their freedom of movement .
Specifically , the proposal for a directive contains a number of welcome provisions clarifying existing legislation .
A new provision also allows the required two years professional experience to be avoided .
The Council rejected all our proposed amendments .
That demonstrates and says a lot about the lack of political will in this area .
Framework agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the Commission ( C5-0349 / 2000 )
The agreement bears out existing practice and even limits public access to a certain extent .
Parliament has not even had the opportunity to discuss or amend this agreement .
But this is a far cry from what actually happens .
These incidents are no accident .
So , logically , everyone tries to please the Commission in order to get on its list of friends .
This is one of the ways in which the Commission keeps everyone under control .
The framework agreement restricts this provision .
Rapporteurs and ' ordinary ' MEPs can therefore be denied access to information .
From a practical point of view , it will lengthen the discharge procedure .
As Members of Parliament , we ought to have the legal right to complete information .
Of course , there may be justifiable exceptions that must be respected .
The closed door policy is unacceptable to the public , the elected representatives and journalists alike .
Members of Parliament must fight for their rights as elected representatives .
But I cannot endorse the proposed regulation with regard to confidential documents .
This is why I have abstained from the vote .
The ' Echelon ' System ( B5-0593 and 0594 / 2000 )
The issue has huge implications for the democracy and freedom of communications .
This question is fundamental because it conditions the very raison d 'être of the European structure .
Why , in fact , are we constructing Europe ?
To be stronger , more independent , richer ?
Obviously , the answer is yes .
Then why accept the Echelon system , which makes us dependent and poorer as the result of lost contracts ?
Anyone can see that this is where the ambiguity of the European construction lies .
We must defend the true Europe , the truly European Europe !
I hope that other Member States will follow France 's example .
Lehne report ( A5-0175 / 2000 )
The document is very sound and strikes a fine balance .
But organised crime embraces a great deal more .
This report can be used as a basis for further action .
This is why I abstained from the vote .
So where , in your economy , is the dividing line between dirty money and allegedly clean money ?
Are the profits from the arms trade clean money ?
Are the huge sums spent bribing officials in order to land public procurement contracts clean money ?
You , however , do not even seem able to contemplate measures such as this .
Just a few figures suffice to substantiate this position .
Money laundering accounts for between 2 % and 5 % of the world 's GDP each year .
This phenomenon is now a threat of the first order .
This seminar culminated in the ' Bercy recommendations ' .
First , the list of offences needs to be extended .
That is why I am abstaining .
Subsidiarité oblige !
Lehne report ( A5-0179 / 2000 )
We must take steps to amend this regulation .
Once they have arrived in the EU , they are completely lacking in rights and social protection .
Europe needs to change its attitude to immigration .
Haug report ( A5-0184 / 2000 )
Who could forget the circumstances under which the financial perspectives were drawn up at the Berlin summit .
It is therefore possible to find a substantial sum of money for the Balkans without revising the financial perspectives .
Estimates show that a significant surplus will be available in the agricultural budget under heading 1a .
The reconstruction of the Western Balkans is on top of our political agenda .
It is also one of the most important tasks for the European Union in the coming years .
We believe that the new priorities need to be matched to the ' fresh money ' available .
The same applies to the cuts they propose in the areas of employment and the environment .
In the same way , we reject the cut of EUR 300 million for agriculture .
Accordingly , we agree with some of the rapporteur ' s proposals .
However , although she does suggest some improvements , they fall well short of what is absolutely necessary .
Furthermore , some of the amendments made in the final vote limited and even changed its scope .
And that is without even looking at the position on defence policy .
For these reasons , we voted against the final version of the report .
Paciotti report ( A5-0177 / 2000 )
They are therefore ignorant of some of their personal data .
First of all , I wanted to vote against Amendment No 11 .
We have negotiated with our US counterparts for over two years .
It is not certain that the new compromise proposal will be as good as this was .
We are now going backwards .
I voted against the committee proposal along with other members of my Group .
We are all very sorry that we have to wait for this agreement to come into force .
I am therefore summing up the key points during the explanations of vote .
Will it be possible to take them to court ?
Will they have to pay compensation ?
That concludes the explanations of vote .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Implementation of EMU ( continuation )
The present currencies are not yet being converted into the euro .
The switch to the euro should not lead to improper price increases .
It is economically naive and will do huge macroeconomic damage .
Every newspaper I open has stories about the euro .
Banks and accountancy firms are running seminars and briefing clients .
This is not about information , this is about propaganda .
I do not trust the Commission to provide unbiased information .
The very idea is absurd .
In Britain , 70 % of people are opposed to joining the euro .
I therefore have two demands to make of the Commission .
Having made this initial comment , I would like to clarify certain points which I consider to be essential .
Companies are the special objective of the information campaign at the moment .
I would like to make some comments relating to the various points mentioned in the debate .
On the whole , the proposals in the communication coincide with the proposals which have been made here .
Nevertheless , there are certain points which deserve additional comment .
Firstly , what action must we take in the ' pre-in ' countries or in third countries ?
This will clearly happen , as long as those countries want it to happen .
Two additional comments .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Use of certain dangerous substances and preparations
In this scientific assessment , it is a concern for young children ' s health that is being expressed .
People who read this warning will not buy these toys for their children or grandchildren .
In this way , the warning will constitute an indirect ban .
In addition , the process of labelling toys is expensive and difficult to carry out in practice .
However , there is no scientific basis for this assumption .
Speakers will also put forward their own assessments of the scientific basis .
As the rapporteur , I share the concerns of the Members of Parliament in my committee .
We also need legislation which cannot be undermined or discredited by legal challenges .
It is now up to us to assess the proposals .
I have not seen a proposal as ridiculous and complex as this one for a long time .
Children in this age group will put any toy in their mouths .
This can only be achieved by a ban on all phthalates in toys .
We also need labelling for the three to six age group .
But anyway , it is now before us .
If we go for this option , then we should at least be consistent .
I am interested to see what the European Commission ' s opinion would be on this .
We have insufficient data available at this stage to establish this .
On a final note , how far do we take the precautionary principle at the end of the day ?
There are very clear warning signs with regard to the risks associated with phthalates .
It is obvious that children who are only a few years old cannot assimilate a warning text .
Once they have the toy in their hands , it is , as it were , too late .
The Commission 's proposal is also completely insufficient for this .
A ban is already in place in several Member States , as several speakers have already mentioned .
I consider that this would be extremely unfortunate .
The rapporteur for this report is a member of the Swedish Moderate Party .
We are usually clear political opponents - I am a member of the Swedish Left Party .
I think it says something about him that he has resisted some of this criticism .
Another problem is clearly the fact that much of the scientific evidence on these matters is conflicting .
Mr President , last month , we held a debate on tobacco .
The risks to public health when using tobacco are clear and scientifically proven .
In accordance with the precautionary principle , this possible harmfulness has to be underpinned scientifically .
These tests resulted in a so-called ' acceptable daily intake ' for animals .
For humans , a further safety margin of a factor of 100 was added on .
On this basis , toys can be approved or rejected .
Why are these risks accepted and not others ?
Moreover , we do not know what the harmful effects of alternatives will be .
Mr President , Mr Arvidsson , I fully appreciate the work which you have done on this report .
We are talking about risks to children ' s health .
This is of interest to all of us , certainly .
The social and health cost of a hasty decision may be medically and economically irreparable .
Mr President , we congratulate Mr Arvidsson for his hard work .
The ban on a range of identified phthalates was precautionary .
The first is how the Commission handles the scientific advice available to it .
Was it done in a balanced way ?
I am not sure about this and I want to return to it in an explanation of vote .
On the issue of labelling , I am sorry to see that there are amendments against this .
Essentially , the number of plastic objects which could be put in the mouth and swallowed is increasing .
The precautionary principle should rule .
Mr President , the Commission 's approach to this whole issue is totally inadequate .
We all know that children under three put toys in their mouths .
To justify this by saying that we label them is completely ridiculous .
What is happening here is that the Commission and others are bowing to the pressures of industry .
When we talk about the precautionary approach , Mr Blokland is wrong .
In banning some of the objects the Commission recognises that these substances are dangerous .
Which comes first : children 's health or the vested interests of industry ?
We must take the precautionary approach .
It is better for it to be emotions that govern this discussion than for it to be industry !
I think that we should behave in the same way even when we are in this House .
We have enough information to make the necessary decisions .
Several speakers here have said that we know that these substances can be hazardous to health .
The precautionary principle must be applied !
The Commission 's proposal is neither sensible nor sufficient .
Who says there could remotely be a risk ?
So , what does the CSTEE say about this ?
The CSTEE met and decided on 25 November .
Why is the Commission rushing forward now ?
Crying wolf damages the credibility of the precautionary principle .
I ask the Commission to answer these questions today , and to get its internal scaremongers under control .
We know that they are suspected of possibly causing cancer , as well as disturbing the balance of hormones .
I am therefore in favour of banning all phthalates in toys designed for the smallest children .
I think that would be a sensible health policy .
As other colleagues have said , this is a thoroughly odd proposal .
I do not think it should be withdrawn , I think it should be suspended .
I am concerned about the precedent that this proposal will set .
The precautionary principle is very sensibly described in a recent Commission paper .
It is the Commission 's task to assess that risk .
I am concerned that the science behind this proposal is incomplete .
We also lack the evidence on migration limits , and that has been mentioned .
That might have enabled the Commission to bring forward a proposal we could all agree with .
What we therefore have is a thoroughly unsatisfactory proposal .
Six phthalates are identified , and a system of warnings proposed that makes no sense .
If these are dangerous , then they should all be banned and warnings would then be unnecessary .
Mr President , the matter under discussion concerns children , and is therefore highly emotive .
I know that very well , as a mother of three .
Reliable migration tests in respect of phthalates are not available , however .
What is even better is that the issue is being dealt with in a consistent way .
The precautionary principle is a very important tool in environmental legislation .
You can cry wolf once too often .
That is what we are in danger of doing in the case of phthalates .
What sort of repercussions will it have , for example , on food safety ?
If we want to ban PVC , let us do so freely and openly .
Viruses and bacteria , in minimal doses , become vaccines .
Mr President , I would like to thank my colleague , Mr Arvidsson , for his excellent work .
I would be very pleased if we could ban tobacco , which we have classified as dangerous .
As legislators , we cannot use excessive force .
Let us now just ban those which have been shown to be dangerous .
The labelling of toys alone is not sufficiently safe .
It is best if we simply do not buy these products .
They are entirely within their rights , of course .
The Commission 's temporary bans have no legal basis .
We are dealing here with little more than media hysteria and ignorance .
More people have died in Teddy Kennedy 's car than have died of phthalates !
Compare and contrast our position on phthalates with our position on tobacco .
Phthalates have never done any harm to anyone , yet we are banning them .
We subsidise it with millions of euros .
If we ban existing products , alternative products may be even more dangerous .
In trying to defend an untenable position the Commission has shamelessly sought to gag its own scientific advisers .
It has bowdlerised their reports , it has pressured them into changing their positions .
Honesty and transparency have been sacrificed to expedience .
Neither the temporary bans nor the permanent ban are justified by the evidence .
We hear far too much about the precautionary principle .
One was a decision providing for an emergency temporary ban , renewable every three months .
The Commission 's proposed directive consists of two elements .
The proposed directive would harmonise the rules of Member States .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Beef and beef products
It is already a highly technical and unwieldy system .
Provision is also made for a beef and beef product labelling system .
This endeavour started four years ago .
There has been a long delay , which we have frequently criticised .
We now have a situation which I shall explain in simplified terms .
After the first reading in Parliament , the Council approved a common position .
This common position incorporates most of the amendments made by the European Parliament .
The wording of the regulation has been simplified and its application made easier .
The monitoring system has been strengthened .
If Mr Papayannakis wants to express a personal opinion , he should have the freedom to do so .
What he cannot do is to confuse the two .
I have presented the entire discussion and the entire dispute surrounding the regulation .
Mr President , this legislation on the labelling of beef has two distinct aspects .
Firstly it ensures traceability of beef products .
Occasionally , however , there is a problem such as the E-coli outbreak in Scotland .
Secondly , labelling will identify the country or countries of origin of beef .
I will now comment on the amendments .
The inclusion of category is unnecessary , costly and potentially confusing to consumers .
Most housewives do not know the difference between a heifer and a steer .
Clearly this is a ridiculous situation .
This is a subsidiarity issue .
I am not sure that Austrian farmers would like that to happen .
There is no time for conciliation .
Mr President , this proposal has a long history .
I can understand why the rapporteur and Mr Papayannakis are weary of further controversy .
However , we are almost at the end .
As a result of that , we thought the matter was resolved .
Indeed , as Mr Papayannakis has said , there have been counter-concessions from the Commission .
The Commission knows why .
It knows we cannot be bullied with threats that our timetable will slip .
We have done that with a good grace .
We are not prepared to do that .
Conciliation , Mr Papayannakis , does not take very long .
It consists of two words from the Commissioner this afternoon : ' We accept . '
Let us hear them .
This is where we need to get to .
Consumer confidence however , requires more than traceability .
The Council regulation before us must be adopted to avoid a legal vacuum arising .
The main thing is that consumers need to be able to make sense of it .
We need to take great care not to impose unnecessary additional costs on these companies .
As soon as consumers are worried , anxious or afraid , we give them a label .
So in that case , what do you put on the label ?
The whole itinerary ?
Or just ' Origin : European Union ' ?
So , today , we are offered a compromise .
It all started with milk quotas back in 1984 .
In order to increase their yield , the British stuffed their cows with bonemeal .
José Happart , a Socialist , and I have been warning of the risk of a zoonosis since 1989 .
Mr President , yesterday we heard Mr Chirac set out his objectives for the French presidency .
It is precisely this sort of detailed , petty interference that drives the people served by Europe to distraction .
Soon labels will no longer suffice .
Perhaps even Macdonald 's might be forced to protest .
I will make a prediction .
When this legislation finally goes through we will hear paeans of self-congratulation .
Everybody involved will tell themselves how jolly hard they worked .
Well , they may be pleased but they certainly will not be loved by the people of Europe .
Mr Chirac is going to be disappointed .
The people are despairing .
An attempt is being made then to withhold information on the grounds that consumers are ostensibly stupid .
The implementing provisions for this regulation are being enacted under the committee procedure .
That means that tomorrow we will have to vote on a legal text whose precise content is unknown .
Even the Commission cannot tell us exactly what form these implementing provisions will take .
I regard this as a very unfortunate procedure , which demonstrates the democratic deficit in the Community decision-making process .
I cannot support its inclusion .
All the Community producers are calling for well-defined but not oppressive regulations .
But it has since turned into an almost unending saga .
We want a workable system , and we have always said that .
I would welcome some comments from the Commissioner on that point .
Commissioner , please accept the amendments and we will then have something workable in place by 1 September .
I would have liked to simply approve the common position without further ado .
However , I find one point that has already been mentioned several times enormously difficult - category of animal .
This comes under compulsory labelling , where it has no place to be .
I therefore support the adoption of Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 3 and 5 .
I am afraid I cannot follow this either .
In my view , this amendment lacks precision .
How is ' origin ' to be defined here ?
Exactly how will origin be indicated ?
There has been fruitful interinstitutional cooperation , and the codecision procedure has shown its strength .
After EU enlargement this sort of system will be vital for consumers and producers .
Now it depends on the Member States whether the practice of labelling is adopted in the hoped for manner .
I also hope consumer organisations will give their strong support to the implementation of the provisions in practice .
Already there is some evidence that this is happening .
Labelling , however , needs to be sensible .
Over-description would only lead to confusion and is unnecessary .
Mr President , that went quicker than I thought .
Politicians need to take this into consideration .
Mr Whitehead has already pointed them in the right direction .
It is good that categories have been removed .
Mr President , Commissioner , it is not the label that counts .
Beef labelling is an important stage in the process of rebuilding consumer confidence .
The question for consumers will be this : what information can we expect ?
Where was the animal born ?
In the EU , in a third country , at which farm , in what region ?
What does country of origin mean , or perhaps even source country ?
And then there is the debate about categories .
Should I buy a sucking calf , a normal calf or a heifer today ?
We should not make the legislation unnecessarily complicated .
We are all concerned about public health and consumer protection .
Yet I do not think that cattle headed for the slaughterhouse are really such great tourists .
However , strict criteria must also apply to imports from third countries .
Our top athletes ' eating habits have a great impact on health and performance .
I hope that we can rebuild confidence and that people will once more become great meat-eaters .
The committee took an important decision in rejecting the category of animal labelling proposal .
That is not the case in my country .
Another thorny problem relating to the proposal is labelling showing the origin of the meat .
The proposal is for the labelling system to be introduced in two stages .
In the first stage there would just be slaughter information .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am sure there are still many more questions .
We have discussed this at length in committee .
Designation of origin is particularly important for consumers .
The preparatory work our farmers have done on labelling has been good and clear .
We have made good progress with beef labelling in Germany .
We certainly need to keep an eye on products imported from third countries .
These should be clearly recognisable as such when they are sold .
But what about those sometimes excessively detailed descriptions ?
They are confusing .
We are effectively being asked to buy the bovine equivalent of a pig in a poke .
This is not acceptable .
I would say to the Commissioner , please accept our amendments in relation to this area .
I am still confused about the situation in relation to mince .
I am not quite sure where we stand on that but we will be advised .
The French situation is amazing .
What does that tell us about political interference from the top in France ?
What is that saying about French beef production and protectionism ?
What is it saying about the Anglo-French beef issue ?
If the French want to label beef they can do so voluntarily .
I am therefore pleased that this Regulation has been adopted .
The indication of categories is not necessary at all .
Furthermore , this Regulation lays down obligatory minimum requirements and there is always the possibility of voluntary optional labelling .
Mr President , I would also like to concentrate on this issue of category of animal labelling .
This is very sloppy , very amateur and unacceptable as a way to treat this House .
It is not even a food safety issue .
If countries wish to include it voluntarily that is a matter for them .
So they know what they have to do .
We have to ask ourselves what we are trying to achieve and whose fears we are trying to allay .
If you can achieve that then you will go a long way to allaying the consumers ' fears .
Much work has been done to ensure that the consumer is in possession of the correct information .
Timing has always been vital in this area , and it still is .
This took place on 3 May .
This was then formally transmitted to Parliament in mid-June together with the Commission ' s communication .
We should not therefore jeopardise this common interest and this move towards integration again .
This issue has been scrutinised in great detail both here in Parliament and also by the Council .
This demonstrates that the regulation will also have a similar impact .
So it will certainly not be possible to put the new proposal into practice .
That is the effect it would have .
And that would result in the opposite of what we are trying to achieve .
I do not therefore believe that this new proposal would improve or add to information for consumers .
I would now like to turn to the much discussed issue of category .
It leads to greater transparency and I believe it is important for consumers .
So as a consumer , I would like to know what I am paying 50 % more for .
Let me explain now what we are actually proposing here .
This is also intended as the basis for introducing categories in this case .
We simply want the labelling already applying to whole carcasses to apply to individual cuts as well .
That is all .
We are also willing to make distinctions for meat prepared in different ways .
That is what this is about , and that alone !
The category detail is a matter for the implementing provisions .
But that would be another kettle of fish .
That is why I think that the procedure proposed here is correct .
That can surely not be in Europe ' s interest .
Of course , politically speaking there is more than one way of looking at this issue .
Surely that is not the idea .
So I believe that we should adhere to the common position in this respect as well .
I would now like to make two brief points .
We cannot accept that , it would be counterproductive .
I would therefore ask you to bear these considerations in mind when you vote tomorrow .
This is a mock-up of how one of these labels will look in future .
And there is still room for the price and any other information consumers specifically require anyway .
You see , it can work !
Commissioner , this debate is going to go on until we have completed the conciliation process .
Colleagues , I recognise there is a difficulty .
You should corner Mr Fischler individually if you wish to speak to him .
I have been involved in the meat industry for a number of years myself .
The matter is not yet satisfactorily resolved .
Mrs Jackson , do you have a point of order ?
The matter of raising conciliation will be after the vote tomorrow .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon .
Proposal for a regulation on a Community patent
The next item is the Commission communication on the proposal for a regulation on a Community patent .
That is an ambitious goal .
Our proposal meets this ambitious goal as it aims at creating just such a patent .
The creation of such a centralised jurisdiction requires a change to the EC Treaty .
We now have a window of opportunity with the ongoing Intergovernmental Conference .
May I insist on the need for an ambitious approach .
We must not skimp on this question , especially now that we are introducing a Community patent .
But I would like to ask a specific question concerning the process in EPO .
Mr President , I would like firstly to congratulate the Commissioner .
I believe that this is a great achievement .
That is the reason why the European Patent Office uses more than one expert .
The President of France , Mr Jacques Chirac , has written to President Prodi on this question .
A note setting out the Commission 's position on this issue has been placed on our website .
I am also pleased that we will achieve legal certainty .
So on that account I welcome Commissioner Bolkenstein 's statement .
Finally , I gather that it is proposed that software might be patented .
My Group would be very unhappy about such a proposal .
In the biotechnology area there is still this grey area .
You purported to have reached an absolute decision on this .
So if the Commission 's proposal is accepted there will be three ways of getting patents .
That exists now and will continue to exist .
The second possibility that will continue to exist is the European patent granted by the European Patent Office .
The European patent is not to be confused with the Community patent .
That possibility - that is the reality at the moment - will continue to exist .
That is why it is called the Community patent .
The Commission does not intend to take away any possibilities that exist at present .
Let me address Mrs Thors who asked about decentralisation in this field .
We cannot have it both ways .
We cannot have our cake and eat it .
That is also what I would like to say to Mr MacCormick .
Secondly there are national patent offices .
In that way they can stimulate and help the small and medium enterprises existing in those respective countries .
Europe and the European Patent Office in fact have a very high level of inventiveness .
I believe that this is enormously significant as an instrument of economic policy .
Mr President , Commissioner , I too would like to congratulate you on presenting this proposal .
I also entreat my fellow Members not to raise issues of principle on language matters .
This is a special field subject to special arrangements .
I hope that was not a reference to a possible location for the European Patent Court .
I would like to ask him four questions .
Would this cause a real problem ?
Is that a problem ?
Thirdly , on the position of the European Parliament , we do not really have much of a say .
Finally , what is the latest on the future expansion of the Community patent ?
Six questions have been put by three Members of your assembly .
Perhaps I may deal with them one by one .
The same Member of Parliament asked about jurisdiction .
Obviously this is to the detriment of European competitiveness .
That is also the reason why the Luxembourg convention was never operative .
Mr De Clercq says why can we not have five languages .
May I point out that the European Patent Office is not a Community agency .
The penultimate point , raised by Mr De Clercq , was about the codecision procedure .
There is no other way of keeping and maintaining a Community patent .
Thank you very much for your replies , Mr Bolkestein .
That concludes the Commission ' s statement and the subsequent debate .
Question Time ( Commission )
The next item is Question Time ( B5-0532 / 00 ) . We will examine questions to the Commission .
Question No 25 by ( H-0549 / 00 ) :
There are quite different , important concerns to be taken into account .
Adequate security of any preserved traffic data will have to be ensured .
We perhaps , therefore , need to discuss this in the future in order to get a complete answer .
We all want to combat cyber crime .
It is important that it is crime that is curbed and not the new economy .
It is a question of creating confidence in development if e-commerce is to work .
Therefore , the work cannot be carried out in secret .
Nobody has yet found the right answer .
Question No 27 by ( H-0543 / 00 ) :
Some EU Member States do not belong to the NATO military alliance .
All EU Member States have agreed this and are ready to contribute to it .
Mr President , Commissioner , I thank you for your full reply .
As I said , I do not think it is necessary to have any treaty change .
Question No 28 by ( H-0555 / 00 ) :
However , to become a reality , the Rome Statute must be ratified by 60 States .
Other Member States will shortly present legislation to their parliaments .
The Commission supports NGO initiatives that promote the establishment of the ICC .
It is , of course , very doubtful whether it will be done in time for December this year .
However , in order for the ICC to be able to work , broad international support is necessary .
We have certainly pursued the importance of ratification with the United States .
The sooner the court can sit , the better for everyone .
There are questions of our judicial personality or lack of judicial personality which have a direct bearing on that .
In general , the Commission will continue to seek solutions to the environmental problems caused by traffic .
We have proposed new solutions in draft form , which have also recently been put forward to the Commissioner .
Question No 30 by ( H-0524 / 00 ) :
The programmes were started in August and are still ongoing .
We have received assurances on this from two different sources .
I would ask Members to limit themselves to new questions or supplementary questions .
Question No 31 by ( H-0540 / 00 ) :
So this is something we are giving quite some attention to .
These statistics , the extrapolation if you will , should be taken quite seriously .
We adopted in the Community already in 1989 a directive on the protection of animals kept for farming purposes .
This is clear to everybody .
Question No 32 by ( H-0567 / 00 ) :
Full details of this case have been previously forwarded to Mr Nielson 's private office .
Will the Commission agree to compensate Mr Howard for his losses ?
Thankfully they were safely evacuated .
Mr Howard was under contract to an association of consultants .
Mr Howard was not directly contracted as a staff member by us but was working for a company .
I regret the delay in providing the honourable Member with the information requested .
The answer I have given today will be confirmed in writing shortly .
Well that did not hurt , did it ?
Question No 33 by ( H-0573 / 00 ) :
If the evolution of the situation should require , these additional funds then can be mobilised .
Among ECHO 's implementing partners are the UNHCR , the ICRC and several European NGOs .
More recently operations have increasingly been focusing on Chechnya itself .
Commissioner , thank you very much for your detailed reply .
I would like to ask a supplementary question : what is the position on funds already spent ?
We have been able to do it in a fashion which we are quite happy with .
We have not been using Russian organisations in a way that gives any concern .
So we are quite pleased .
What we are not pleased with has been the lack of more direct access into Chechnya .
Thank you very much , Mr Nielson .
Questions to Mr Barnier
Most Member States have sent in appropriate information , especially regarding funding .
Madam President , Commissioner Barnier , I would like to thank you for your proposal .
That is one part of my reply .
There you have it ; I have been frank with you .
Mr MacCormick , thank you for highlighting this point .
In this specific case , I said ' a weakness ' .
I am not a fatalist .
That is what Mr MacCormick has highlighted .
Question No 36 by ( H-0528 / 00 ) :
Which Member States have caused difficulties in the implementation of what the Commission has requested ?
I personally sent these guidelines to each of the Member States on 28 March .
A person 's wallet is the most sensitive part of their anatomy .
Question No 37 by ( H-0544 / 00 ) :
Questions to Mrs Wallström
We expect and we hope , Mr Hatzidakis , that these points will also be quickly finalised .
What is to be done about outsourcing the external employees whom we need ?
This law is based on the provisions included in the Community Support Framework .
The computer system for integrated management will also need to be fully operational .
That is the assurance which I wanted to give you .
Is Mr Barnier aware of this problem ?
I spent last week in a region of Finland .
I do not want to point my finger or make a priori judgments .
I prefer education .
500 administrators attended , from all the management authorities , from the whole of Europe .
I referred earlier , during my reply to Mr Hatzidakis , to training .
Thank you very much for your cooperation , Mr Barnier .
Question Nos 38 , 39 and 40 will be replied to in writing .
We will proceed , late , to the last 20 minutes of questions to Commissioner Wallström .
As the author is not present , Question No 41 lapses .
Question No 42 by ( H-0521 / 00 ) :
Dublin Bay Watch has complained to the Commission and provided extensive evidence .
Dublin Bay was mentioned as a partially classified important bird area .
As regards the special protection areas they have completely ignored their obligations .
In this case they have basically done what they want .
They change the boundaries whenever they feel like it .
It seems the only thing they are willing to listen to is the threat of fines .
I would like to mention that two qualifications need to be made .
I am sure that we will have to continue the legal proceedings against Ireland .
Question No 43 by ( H-0529 / 00 ) :
Does it intend to impose fines in the event of violations ?
The Commission has very little information on waste management in Greece .
The hazardous wastes are reported to be either temporarily stored or exported for final disposal in other countries .
But the question remains .
Is there absolutely no way of establishing where these huge quantities of waste go ?
There is an application before the Court .
Of course we are worried .
Unfortunately Greece has not done this properly .
I should like to put two questions to you .
The first is : what sanctions will be imposed on Greece ?
In the meantime , what about public health in Greece ?
Toxic waste is an extremely important issue .
Which specific areas of Community legislation are causing problems ?
Question No 44 by ( H-0547 / 00 ) :
Commission . ( SV ) The pollution of industrial land is a big problem in Europe .
This directive must be enforced completely before November 2007 .
At EU level , the European Regional Development Fund can contribute a certain amount of support .
I would like to thank Commissioner Wallström for her reply .
I think that a common strategy would be needed to deal with these issues .
That is actually what I was after in the question that I raised .
Up to now we have mainly regarded this as a local and national issue .
This same problem concerns former landfill sites that are later used for housing .
The Commission may have information on the extent of the problem in the Member States .
Does the Commission think it possible that some kind of strategy could be found regarding these built-up areas ?
It is very evidently a problem that must be dealt with at national , regional and local levels .
However , if the Member States should so desire , we obviously have nothing against taking on this task .
Question No 45 by ( H-0548 / 00 ) :
Nine people were injured , and the village was badly damaged .
A similar explosion has just occurred at the Pyroma de Feugueyrolles factory in France .
This means both the stockpiling of more explosive substances and greater reactivity .
A review of the Seveso II directive is already under way .
We will be looking at this as soon as we have evaluated all the information about these accidents .
We will not sit on our hands .
( The sitting was suspended at 8.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. ) .
EMAS ( Eco-Management and Audit Scheme )
I hope that tomorrow other groups will offer oral amendments in this respect .
All that , however , is not enough , in my view .
It must not therefore be encumbered with concepts such as best available technology .
These are binding specifications which set excessively difficult targets .
All we shall achieve by adopting them is to make businesses quit the system .
That surely serves no purpose at all .
We cannot realise such ideals by opting for a voluntary system like EMAS .
The proposal envisages renewal of the validation at yearly intervals .
That , to my mind , is far too frequent .
Companies have to spend nine months on the preparation of an environmental report .
They cannot do that if annual validation is required .
I therefore propose an interval of two to three years , and I hope you will support this proposal .
My Group also attaches particular importance to the participation of employees and their representatives .
Seven years after its creation , however , EMAS is a success only in some countries .
EMAS is complex , too complex .
Yet they are the engine of Europe ' s economy .
I mean Amendments Nos 5 , 10 and 17 on the best available technologies , the BATs .
So the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party will be voting against .
Finally , I will simply say that quantity must not drive out quality .
I cannot understand the reluctance to accept this .
It really is an essential instrument .
It makes no sense to me whatsoever to be reluctant to promote that .
If the best available technology is there , then the firm should be encouraged to use it .
We are never going to make any advances otherwise .
I would urge the Commission , too , to take this on board .
We must find an effective and manageable solution to that problem .
For that reason we need to set a standard .
This has also been noted by the European Parliament in some of its amendments .
It might be said that it is a minimum requirement that environmental legislation should be respected .
The purpose of EMAS is to help organisations to perform better and to exceed that minimum .
EMAS is , however , a voluntary system .
EMAS will instead become a replacement for environmental verifications carried out by the Member States ' competent authorities .
I am convinced that that is not the European Parliament ' s intention .
How frequently is the environmental statement to be validated ?
That report must therefore correspond to the expectations of those in the surrounding area .
One such expectation is that the environmental statement should be reliable .
I would emphasise that the common position is flexible in this respect .
Account can , therefore , already be taken of special cases or special problems .
Allow me to turn now to the individual amendments .
The Commission is therefore delighted to be able to approve Amendments 1 , 2 and 19 ( 3 ) .
Because EMAS is a voluntary system , it is important that there should be information about it .
Amendment 25 will contribute considerably to making the EMAS requirements clearer , and the Commission approves this change .
Unanimity and openness are also important principles for EMAS .
Those amendments which relate only to the industrial sector cannot , therefore , be approved .
Thank you , Madam Commissioner .
May I depart from normal practice by asking you to pay greater attention to the allocated time slots .
Your colleague Mrs Reding is the very last speaker today .
She will no doubt be annoyed with me if she has to stay here until one in the morning .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Limit values for benzene and carbon monoxide
The common position is a definite improvement on the Commission 's proposal .
I also very much welcome the fact that it incorporates many of the amendments adopted by this House .
In addition , we have underlined very clearly that the Member States will also have to compile better documentation .
I shall close there - my time is up in any case .
The proposal was presented by the European Commission in December 1998 .
Our Group would have warmly welcomed that .
Our Group accepts this common position and can support it as it stands .
It will be the first legal instrument to set a limit on concentrations of a carcinogenic substance .
Mr President , the three previous speakers have already articulated the significance of these proposals .
We should also like to congratulate the rapporteur .
The Commission approves Amendment 2 , which expressly mentions the Internet .
Amendment 1 may therefore be approved in principle , but must be reworded .
I turn finally to Amendment 4 , which concerns an important issue .
The Commission is therefore unable to approve Amendment 4 .
Thank you , Commissioner Wallström .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
That really is all that a recommendation is .
I recognise the Commission 's worries .
They want a directive and not a recommendation .
We do not need that kind of supra-national inspectorate .
We cannot understand the Commission 's readiness to propose only the minimum possible .
Neglect of European Union environment law forms an alarming background to this proposal .
Why do they not know ?
We need the kind of directive that the Environment Committee would like to see .
A recommendation will do no good .
The question obviously is why we have not had that before .
There is also a question for Member States .
I have chemical companies in my constituency in the north-west of England .
They get inspected .
Action is taken .
They are forced to clean up their act .
They pay the price for that .
It is simply unfair .
The second issue is the clear conflict here between the Parliament and the Council .
Well , they might as well , as Mrs Jackson has said .
The message for the French Presidency is that we want tangible progress .
We do not want to see this abandoned .
All the institutions in the European Union want the laws enforced properly .
It is time to give these warm but rather woolly sentiments some real meaning and action .
The bad implementation of environmental rules has nothing to do with the lack of such rules and directives .
We have a lot of these and we really want to achieve something .
We want to see results .
So we came straight to the key issue : was it to be a recommendation or a directive ?
A recommendation will achieve something .
Thank you , Commissioner Wallström .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Protection of forests
Furthermore , the Member States must carry out a periodic assessment .
Here we have a proposal by the Committee on Budgets .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mrs Redondo , I have to tell you that Mr Cunha has just come in .
Mrs Redondo almost hijacked your speaking time , Mr Cunha !
Ladies and gentlemen , I must ask for your cooperation .
Thank you very much , Mr President .
I would like to tell Mrs Redondo that the delegation of Spanish Socialists is going to support her amendments .
I would like to give just two recent examples .
That is why we are going to support her .
In the Nordic countries , we obviously do not have the same problems as in the Mediterranean area .
It is therefore incorrect to talk in this context about the forests of Europe .
The forests of Europe are very , very different from one another .
However , this report concerns the threats to our forests .
Fires do not constitute a problem for the Nordic forests . On the contrary .
We need more fires .
We set fires for ecological reasons .
In the Nordic forests , there are a great many species of plant which have waxed seeds .
They have to be warmed up by a fire in order to grow .
In the Nordic countries , there are also insects which need burning ant hills in order to breed .
Forests are , furthermore , an imaginary , mythological and symbolic asset , which we should not forget .
Biodiversity is also affected , and the situation of various plant species is worrying .
It is therefore extremely important .
Geographers understand this very well .
The situation is so different between the north and the south .
The Commission will present its proposals for their revision before the end of this year .
Thank you , Commissioner Fischler .
You are the first Commissioner today who has not taken up his full allocation of speaking time .
We note that with gratitude .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
MEDIA / MEDIA Plus
The cross-border distribution of European films remains too limited .
The first of these , as so often , concerns the budget .
The Commission is proposing EUR 400 million for a five-year programme in the audiovisual domain .
Whoever wants to grasp the opportunities offered by the digital revolution must be prepared to make the requisite investment .
That is why the figure of 400 million is too low .
This increase alone , however , will not bring spectacular success .
We need two additional instruments .
The second area is the question of the legal basis .
This should also be made clear in the programme and be reflected in the legal basis .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are discussing a very important report here today .
So I believe we have cooperated well , even with the representatives of the European United Left .
Together with the Commission , we have also managed to make a good Commission proposal even better .
What is on offer here is therefore insufficient .
What we find here is not enough to enable us to respond to the audiovisual revolution .
I believe we have a duty to keep emphasising this fact .
To put it bluntly , a European audiovisual policy has yet to materialise .
That is why we must make an all-out effort here .
We have concentrated on the key points .
The Council should be called to account here .
We should like more money , and we should like this addition to the legal basis .
No doubt you will be able to echo these sentiments , Madam Commissioner .
One of the strengths of the European film industry also accounts for its structural weakness .
During production and afterwards , an adequate promotion and marketing budget is generally lacking .
If some laurels can be reaped along the way , so much the better !
Competitiveness and marketability are commendable aims of MEDIA Plus .
Big cinema needs big money .
There is also the question of allowing the provision of venture capital .
This report therefore marks a new attempt to put this financial instrument on the agenda as an accompanying measure .
A key role attaches to the public corporations in particular .
They possess a wealth of human and material resources , which are often the prerequisite for successful productions .
We are opposed to increasing the amounts proposed by the Commission , as recommended by the rapporteur .
The plan is indeed sound .
Indeed , we may well ask ourselves what Europe ' s ambition is .
I do wonder .
This is hardly ever discussed .
In my opinion , all Hollywood wants is a worthy opponent .
This programme does not even take production into account .
Naturally , the intention is not to squander subsidies . Indeed not .
And I would like to ask the Commissioner to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in .
That must change .
Cultural diversity is not a slogan . It is a cultural and economic necessity .
We urgently need to have audiovisual works distributed in every country in Europe .
Grants to cinemas showing non-national European films should be increased .
How can people have so little interest in a market likely to grow so rapidly ?
I think not .
The Commission has already indicated through press agencies that it opposes this amendment .
Mr President , I thank Mrs Hieronymi for the work she has put into this report .
It is important to stress at the outset that this is not just any old report .
But in putting this before the House we have to ask ourselves two very important questions .
Firstly , why do we need this programme ?
Secondly , what is the added value that it is going to bring us ?
Why do we need it ?
We are at the very beginning of an explosion of this industry on this continent .
We have to put ourselves in the position of being able to compete in the international arena .
I believe we are able to do that .
It is absolutely vital that we do not miss the train on this one .
It is absolutely vital that we get in there as a series of institutions committed to building this industry .
My own Group is very committed to the budget that has been laid out in the report .
The only problem there is that our best warriors emigrate to Hollywood .
Be that as it may , we shall not criticise you .
I do not think this is the case .
We have the political will to see that this programme begins on time .
Mr President , I would like to say that I am pleased with the MEDIA Plus document .
I believe that it has been very much improved by Parliament .
Furthermore , postproduction is the field in which the new technologies are working .
That system is completely obsolete .
Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur on the work that she has done .
There are two simple points I want to make .
Certainly the public sector cannot make good films .
I do not believe it can do much of a job of judging what is a good film .
We need to very careful about that .
That certainly is an area that is proposed in this report and is a responsibility at a European level .
We should not forget the radio sector in audio-visual .
I hope that will not be forgotten as this report goes through .
Finally , it is very easy to write a long speech .
It is much harder to give a short speech .
We look to the Commission to spend the money that they have efficiently and effectively .
This needs to be re-emphasised .
The MEDIA desk and the local MEDIA branches have proved to be very useful instruments .
It is vital for these accompanying institutional measures to be retained .
The MEDIA branch offices help to minimise the obstacles to European cooperation , for example .
This is still a rather tender sapling which needs our undivided attention .
Recent years have shown that people are interested in many different types of film .
Europe must not shy away from this window of opportunity .
We usually do congratulate the rapporteur . It is traditional .
We appreciate the rapporteur ' s negotiating talent and her personal commitment .
Thank you very much , Mrs Hieronymi .
Do not expect me to launch into a speech on the importance of European cinema .
I have done that many times , in many places .
We are working to recreate such a fund .
Mr President , I have the list of amendments available .
In fact the only amendments I have reservations about relate , of course , to the budget .
So there will be support for economic , financial and commercial management from a European perspective .
Although these amendments are legitimate in spirit , they go beyond the scope of the decision .
I can make the list of these amendments available , Mr President .
I am forced to express reservations on eleven of the amendments tabled .
So I need not go over it again .
Amendment No 115 would create a sub-programme within the programme .
So I do not think we should go that far .
They will contribute to achieving our goal : the creation of a strong content industry in Europe .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Reding .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Quality evaluation in school education
I thank you all for your very constructive attitude .
I would now ask you for your support to deliver on these agreements .
I would advise you not to pursue the amendments tabled by the PSE .
It is important to couple education with the labour market .
This is borne out by the results reached in Lisbon .
This is why this should also be included in this report .
The other amendments are already more or less reflected in the text or in other amendments .
Finally , I would like to mention the financial dimension .
That will then be a good time to consider a possible increase in the funding .
I thank you and look forward to your reactions .
But education is important and we must make sure it gets the attention it deserves .
Often education attracts fine words .
What it does not always get is the action to match those words .
Quality evaluation is one of those .
What they were looking at were their baccalaureate results .
So we think nothing about evaluating youngsters .
We cannot afford to allow that to continue to happen .
Where are those young people going to come from ?
In English we say " two heads are better than one " .
Any change to the educational system calls into question the ideology of the society and its economic development .
We must not seek to respond at any price to a constantly developing market .
They need to be offered appropriate teaching .
No child is devoid of talent .
Every system creates its own type of failures .
The criteria for identifying failure are essentially subjective .
Success is judged according to pre-established standards .
What are those standards ?
How have they been established ?
Any pupil in difficulties is a young person whose future is compromised .
Any child who is failing is expressing his unease in the educational institution , but also in society .
In rejection he will give vent to his despair ; he will give vent to his hatred .
There is no miracle cure , but there are battles to be fought .
And that means that all those who believe it must combine forces to do so .
We must create the basis for the essential establishment of lifelong learning .
For that reason , I approve of the measures that are proposed here .
They will probably help us to deal more effectively with this challenge .
Let me just come back to a point that I raised myself in an amendment .
There is no need for us to keep reinventing the wheel .
But of course there is a price to pay for that .
We shall vote on our report tomorrow .
At the heart of this project is the school curriculum .
This is the path we must pursue .
You are aware that during the last few years the Commission has initiated several activities in this connection .
Let me now come to the amendments Parliament wants to make to our proposal .
The Commission will accept all the amendments tabled , in full , in substance or in part .
That is already the case .
Other amendments aim to extend the political range of the recommendation and I am very pleased with them .
I also accept Amendments Nos 1 to 14 , which propose new recitals .
Similarly , I agree in principle with Amendment 36 which refers to the Eurydice information network .
Anyway I could agree to a reworded Amendment No 36 .
I am also delighted with Amendments Nos 21 to 35 , which clarify the invitations to the Member States .
Naturally , Parliament will be informed of the results of that conference .
Thank you , ladies and gentlemen , for staying the course !
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
( The sitting was closed at 12 midnight )
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
He knows perfectly well that ours is a non-political Head of State .
He knows perfectly well that for nearly fifty years she has scrupulously avoided engaging in controversial political issues .
He knows perfectly well that she cannot come to this House to set the record straight .
His behaviour is a disgrace and a scandal .
Has he no shame ?
Has he no respect ?
Has he no decency or honour at all ?
Mr President , well , how can I respond to such an attack as that ?
So far , he has refused to comment .
That might not suit Mr Helmer , but I am sorry to say that is the way it goes .
As you will be aware , elections were held in Mexico last Sunday .
Very well , Mr Seguro .
I will certainly inform President Fontaine .
The " Texts Adopted " also form part of the Minutes .
I had already complained about this in committee vis à vis the language services .
Certainly , Mr Lehne .
You gave ample clarification of the matter yesterday . We will certainly ensure that the necessary correction is made .
I think that is a very good idea and quite right .
And I am quite happy to support it .
That in itself is a contradiction so would he please clarify the matter .
( Laughter and applause )
( The Minutes were approved )
Committee on Petitions - European Ombudsman
The Annual Report for 1999 covers the last year of the first mandate of the European Ombudsman .
You may be interested to know that the same trend has continued to the present year .
Inquiries are the most resource-intensive aspect of the Ombudsman 's work .
However in all , more of the e-mail complaints are directed against authorities of Member States .
The regional Ombudsmen and similar bodies will also be invited to Brussels next year .
In 1999 we made ten draft recommendations .
In seven cases the institution concerned has accepted a draft recommendation .
In two cases the Ombudsman has made a special report to the European Parliament .
We are achieving results for European citizens , and this is what matters above all .
Thank you for your attention .
I should also like to express my personal appreciation of the work of Mr Söderman , the Ombudsman .
I would urge Members who are not familiar with the Committee on Petitions to read these reports .
It might well be of use to them in providing a service for the people they represent .
Last year we received 958 petitions of which 492 were considered admissible .
I wish to express our thanks .
That is not unusual .
The aim of the committee is to improve the overall quality of our feedback mechanisms .
Some of our ideas are mentioned in this report .
Others will appear in a further report in September from Mr Perry and Mrs Keßler .
We trust that the relevant authorities will bear this in mind this year and act on the proposal .
There are various points concerning our relations with other committees .
I commend the report to the House .
What has all this got to do with the Ombudsman ' s task ?
" Good administration " is the opposite of " maladministration " .
All these aspects have been central to the Ombudsman ' s work .
It is these rights that make citizenship active instead of passive .
What are the most common complaints to the Ombudsman and into which categories do they fall ?
Citizens want to see good administration .
They want to be active citizens .
The Ombudsman has become renowned for his work for the wider public .
This is something he should receive a lot of praise for .
This is substantial work that Parliament has reason to support .
Mr President , the European Parliament ' s Committee on Petitions is a very special body .
The free movement of persons is one of the basic freedoms achieved through European integration .
That reflects a negative attitude towards the European citizens ' right of petition .
Mr President , the right to petition and to complain is not some recent invention .
But this right was always in danger of being changed , restricted or abolished .
Yesterday ' s petitioners have become today ' s responsible European citizens .
No administration or institution is infallible .
Many petitions point to a discrepancy between the legal provisions and European integration .
I turn now to the Ombudsman .
My group congratulates the Ombudsman on the work he accomplished in 1999 .
New office technologies cannot be used as grounds for the lack of transparency either .
That is , of course , also true in the European institutions .
This is probably something which I would like to see concentrated on in the future .
To summarise , the Ombudsman fulfils a very important function .
I believe that we will be able to draft joint reports on the most important problem areas .
With regard to the Ombudsman , he has truly established his position and independence .
There are therefore not even any amendments .
We see this every day in the Committee on Petitions .
It is the committee which makes the institutions most visible to the citizens .
The speeding up of the process is therefore an important issue which has been taken up by Mrs Lambert .
I would just like to comment on an important statement which has not received due attention .
Seventy-seven per cent of complaints received concern the Commission .
But it appears that not everyone concerned is aware of this problem .
Indeed there has been quite a lot written on the subject .
I saw that at first hand when I attended the seminar in Paris .
In that he has our full support .
Mr President , I should like to start by congratulating the two rapporteurs on their interesting comments .
In more general terms , it is time to see parliamentary control exercised on a different footing .
I wish the ombudsman courage and good luck for the future .
Yesterday 's framework agreement is a milestone in this sense .
I would like to state seven principles .
The bigger a union is , the greater the need for transparency .
And , goodness me , these instructions certainly are necessary !
My suggestion is that we need an Ombudsman ' s portal on the Net .
Thank you for your work !
Few citizens , however , are aware that they may submit a petition .
This , unfortunately , results in 50 % of petitions being inadmissible .
Greater account must also be taken by the other parliamentary committees of the work carried out by our committee .
The chronic absence of the Council from our committee meetings is detrimental to the correct handling of petitions .
We are currently waiting too long for responses from the national authorities , sometimes even several years .
We are fully aware of the extent of this task and the difficulties to be overcome .
By nature they tend to be secretive .
It does not have adequate secretarial assistance .
It is simply not good enough .
The Petitions Committee in particular is an important mechanism of access for the people of Europe .
It is important that we ensure that it can do its work effectively .
They are either ignored or they do not address the real issues .
In the report on individual complaints , it emerges , however , that there is insufficient transparency .
Insufficient and inadequate information was also the most common cause of complaint .
Are there sufficient resources for the work to be carried out well ?
What are the main reasons for the institutions ' shortcomings in relation to the citizens ?
The basic pillars of the work of the Ombudsman are independence and transparency .
For that reason there has to be closer cooperation between the Ombudsman and national and regional ombudsmen .
The Commission takes a very positive view of this work .
I wish to say that the Commission believes that the citizen should always be the focus of our concerns .
We can only confront our defects if we know what they are .
With regard to Mrs Lambert ' s report , I would like to deal with two specific issues .
Secondly , it proposes a review of the examination procedures of the Committee on Petitions .
It is true that we sometimes take a long time to reply .
Its tasks are different from those of law courts .
Mr President , I am grateful to you for giving me the floor to answer questions .
Mr Turco asked about the right to complain by e-mail .
At the moment about 20 % of the complaints we receive are by e-mail .
If you look at our website you will find a form which can be sent directly by e-mail .
Mr Paasilinna said the website could be developed in that direction .
Mr Raschhofer spoke about the draft regulation on public access to documents , which has been debated .
I should like to stress that this draft regulation is now before Parliament .
The committee work can start .
This is now before Parliament .
Mr Malmström mentioned ignorance about the Ombudsman 's office in some Member States .
Members of Parliament are a very important source of information for many citizens .
Thank you kindly , Mr Söderman .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 12 noon .
Single European sky
It is a fact that there is a shortage of air traffic controllers .
What has been produced by the Commission is a major contribution to dealing with the saturation of airspace .
The Council of Transport Ministers needs to take a political decision to address this .
We cannot put it off any longer .
It needs attention now .
This too is an area which need to be addressed .
That may be right for us .
It may be wrong for others .
This cannot last any longer .
We must address this issue now .
It seems obvious that we need to completely rethink the organisation of air traffic control in the European sky .
In this respect , the Commission ' s initiative is commendable .
I have many doubts as to the conclusions of the report .
( The President cut the speaker off )
I regard the broad line of separating the regulatory from the operational function as the right one .
That brings me back to the last speaker .
Nor is that in any way a problem .
Today we have 15 Member States in the European Union , and 12 more have applied to join .
We do not need multilingualism , we need unanimity on the question of the regulatory function .
There may still be some resistance in individual countries .
We share her objectives , we support her aims .
The Party of European Socialists also supports and indeed welcomes the rapporteur 's carefully judged position .
That has to be a key building block of our new approach .
Eurocontrol too must be reformed and revamped and relaunched .
Between 1986 and 1996 air traffic in Europe doubled .
It will double again in the coming ten years .
We need to tackle this issue urgently and swiftly but in a coherent way .
Hopefully the Commissioner today can bring forward a timetable for when those delays will cease .
A number of MEPs have already described the effects of that .
Thousands of people need to be recruited and investments made in technical infrastructure .
As such , it is clear that money has to be earmarked for this .
We need to tackle the issue at European level .
People sometimes overlook this aspect and only focus on their own patch .
We are all agreed on this , and I therefore hope that we can make good progress .
An important point , as Mr Watts has already pointed out , is safety .
Nobody should compromise on safety .
Mr President , the report deals with the problem of increasing air traffic .
What the options are doing is focusing on technical fixes , not the underlying trends .
Certainly a single European sky would increase the efficiency with which European air space is used .
Improvements in air traffic management would make more space available .
Restricting the use of military air space would also make a significant difference .
Consider the facts .
This is not perfect , of course , but they do already exist .
Therefore , in my opinion , thinking that there would be too many control centres is nonsense .
Why not say in that case that there are too many aircraft ?
But what is the value of such a measure ?
It may well be necessary to consider more relevant divisions , why not ?
But that is not what is being proposed .
Air traffic control is not an airline , nor is it a market sector .
Let it not be forgotten that its main function is to ensure safety .
The ability to invest in new technological tools and training must therefore be safeguarded .
The system is highly effective .
On what grounds would you want to break ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
She will in due course be submitting a report on this issue to the Council .
One last thing : I see that the report principally targets the large air carriers and airlines .
This is the situation which the aviation sector currently faces .
We need to consider the future of the sector for the reasons set out above .
In my opinion , we should not accept unlimited growth as a fait accompli .
We should tailor our policy accordingly .
We now need to look for alternative solutions in the short-term .
Despite which , there is clearly a huge problem here .
Eurocontrol has proven to be inadequate as a mechanism for managing air traffic .
There is no doubt that air traffic control delays are a problem .
A visit to any of the major airports at this time of year will make that obvious .
I hear that the average delay is said to be 20 minutes .
It is a clear problem that we need to address .
But not all delays are due to air traffic controls .
Frankly , a lot of the delays are caused by the inefficiencies of some of the airlines themselves .
Passengers go missing .
It never ceases to amaze me the number of passengers that go missing in airports !
What do these people get up to , I ask myself ?
Invariably they cause delays as much as air traffic .
The issue of Eurocontrol is important .
We support the compromise that is made in point 8 with regard to Eurocontrol .
We also support the need for the military to give up some of their air space .
Finally , there are some TDI amendments with this .
I am particularly interested in Amendment No 24 .
I can only assume that the TDI group must ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , I would also like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report .
Experiences from last Monday reconfirm that this is a very important report indeed .
Many Members of Parliament had a journey here to Strasbourg of up to fifteen hours .
Flights were cancelled , and many were severely delayed .
The report proposes relevant action that must be put into effect right away .
Secondly , that is another reason for Eurocontrol ' s poor efficiency .
Thirdly , priority must be given to the civil use of airspace .
First of all , the matter of safety .
The report , however , omits to bring up one fundamental issue : the issue of traffic rights .
It is in the international negotiation of traffic rights that this concept of European air space ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
But in that case , the staff concerned would have no justifiable need of trade unions ?
It is necessary for the civil and military controllers in the control centres to work in close cooperation .
Under cover of a single sky , such liberalisation would actually offer us a multispeed sky .
This is a political problem that depends first and foremost on politicians .
These are the fundamental causes of air delays .
In addition , I cannot imagine tomorrow ' s single European sky becoming an sky shared unfairly between airlines .
This reports mentions delays , which are , apparently , increasingly frequent .
At one time , Greece was part of that problem .
That in itself will go a long way to improving flow control .
Of course , there still remains much to be done .
We are , of course , in the middle of yet another chaotic summer for flights .
This assumes that we have had the necessary political decisions .
This is something we must never put up with .
The report lays down an extremely tight timetable .
I share this ambition .
The Commission can actually achieve this with the help of the Atkins report .
We all suffer from delays that often last hours .
It happens to us MEPs very frequently , as it does to much of the population during the holidays .
Let me remind you of another aspect .
The safety aspect comes top of the list for all passengers , but especially for frequent fliers .
Safety standards must on no account be endangered .
That is why we need better airspace control and protection .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 12 noon .
Health and safety of pregnant workers
The directive should also take the informal economy and atypical employment contracts into consideration .
The number of single parents has risen and women are more concerned with achieving economic independence .
There is a considerable need to improve the legislation .
Here we must avoid any risks .
Any activity that puts their health at risk should without exception be prohibited .
Maternity leave after the birth of the child should be at least eight weeks .
The question of reinstatement also needs to be clarified .
I well remember its genesis and the problems that were discussed at the time .
So I support the call to revise the directive as soon as possible .
However , we will not manage it by the end of the year 2000 .
I very much agree with the rapporteur about this .
I am , therefore , also opposed to our requesting a review of the directive now .
It might be wondered whether new regulations would mean very much in practice .
The Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance calls for an increase in the level of protection .
The report mainly focuses on institutional aspects .
We are asking for the rights of pregnant and breastfeeding women to be extended .
This is why we call for a reversal of the burden of proof .
We would like to close by thanking Mrs Damião for the work she has carried out .
We have a good example of this here .
I am not so sure .
It is stressful , and it is unhealthy both for the pregnant woman and the foetus .
We know this , because investigations have proven this to be the case .
I think we have an example here of the Commission ' s doing all too little in this area .
It needs to be re-done .
We must know whether the legislation is working .
The Commission ' s purely legal analyses now already show that there is a need for further protection .
The Commission must go back to the drawing board , set to work again and table the necessary proposals .
The European social model is characterised by the fact that we have a high level of protection .
It should not be left to the individual Member States .
Modernisation and efforts in this area are therefore important .
We know that many lose their jobs when they become pregnant .
This is completely unacceptable !
How much detail should we go into ?
Maternity / paternity leave and maternity / paternity benefit are examples of issues that are not directly transnational .
We do not believe in detailed common European social legislation .
This does not , however , prevent Member States from cooperating and sharing ideas concerning social issues .
In this connection , the report contains an imbalance .
I know several women who have gone back to work earlier - there must be freedom of choice !
I hope that Parliament will adopt this amendment .
Pregnancy is a natural state for women which society must respect , defend and protect .
Society must care for working women in particular by ensuring that they remain in their jobs .
A minimum salary of 80 % must be guaranteed , with no loss of pension rights .
The ban on dismissal during pregnancy must be strictly complied with .
In no circumstances must pregnancy be a cause for discrimination against women .
The new legislation must be clear and progressive .
It must provide for new working situations and also the new family situation of single parent families .
We must be able to provide the means for breast-feeding to be compatible with work .
I like some of the suggestions in her report .
I congratulate her for the enthusiasm with which she has pursued her agenda .
But in general it is not a health and safety agenda .
It is very much a traditional socialist agenda .
Neither of these are really health and safety issues .
We confirm our commitment to subsidiarity regarding terms and conditions of employment .
Hence we urge the House to reject the report .
I must accept these criticisms since they are true and are based on real facts .
However , I must offer a justification and an explanation .
That is the reason for the delay in presentation .
Directive 92 / 85 was adopted before the Treaty of Amsterdam .
I would like to draw your attention and the attention of fellow Members to a very sad matter .
This previous system has now been changed .
I had a brief look to see how the system worked this week .
The report on Zimbabwe , Tuesday afternoon , was issued at 10.55 p.m.
The report on the European Central Bank on Wednesday morning was issued at 8.00 p.m. the same day .
This kind of reporting is not really of much use at all to the written press .
I have not been consulted about this .
And so I am stuck !
I have taken note of your request .
That would be something else !
We shall now proceed to the vote .
We referred the report back on 16 May and in the meantime it has been improved .
We have achieved it by adopting this procedure for the case in point .
So I would ask that we adopt this document today .
Once again , many thanks for your cooperation !
Commissioner , would you like to respond to the question ?
Commission . ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , just a few brief comments .
I confirm that the Commission accepts 12 of the 13 compromise amendments .
But in terms of substance , the Commission will support them during the discussion with the Council .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the draft resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
This sixth indent concerns our group .
We thereupon refrained from tabling an amendment that also refers to problems in regard to the Socialist Group .
( Applause from the PPE-DE Group )
Mr Poettering , as you are aware , explanations of vote are made after the vote .
We cannot start a debate now , even if the matter is an extremely sensitive issue .
This has not been the case today .
It makes no sense to put conditions on other people ' s votes .
I recommend to Mr Poettering that he reads the report carefully .
( Applause from the PSE Group )
To open up the whole debate again would delay their entry into force .
Then the amendments could not be adopted .
( The President declared the common position approved as amended )
It accepts Amendments Nos 32 and 33 ( second part ) in principle .
The Commission cannot accept the other amendments .
Following Amendment No 49
( The President declared the common position approved as amended )
Commission . ( DE ) The Commission cannot accept Amendment 4 .
Amendments Nos 5 and 6 are not here .
I have only got four amendments here .
. ( DE ) Mr President , I apologise again for my mistake a moment ago !
( The President declared the common position approved as amended )
European Council of 19 / 20 June 2000 at Santa Maria da Feira
Motion for a resolution ( B5-0583 / 2000 )
( Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution )
Motion for a resolution ( B5-0585 / 2000 )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Trafficking in human beings
( Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution ) - Joint motion for a resolution
That is why we have withdrawn our signature .
I ask you to take note of that .
( Parliament adopted the joint resolution )
In view of the time , voting time will be suspended now and resumed at 5.30 p.m.
Mr President , I respect your decision .
Voting time is suspended .
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Please convey that to the Commissioner please , as she is not listening at the moment .
Schierhuber report ( A5-0124 / 2000 )
Stauner report ( A5-0182 / 2000 )
Virrankoski report ( A5-0192 / 2000 )
This is why we abstained from the Virrankoski report .
Stauner Report ( A5-0190 / 2000 )
Mr President , I do not believe Parliament should feel satisfied with what has been achieved so far .
We need hardly wonder why the citizens are increasingly losing faith in Europe .
A number of MEPs have today voted in favour of giving discharge .
Today I voted against that discharge .
The deciding factor was the way the Commissioner for budgets handled the Fléchard case .
This firm was suspected of fraud as early as 1992 .
Nonetheless , it was let off a fine to the tune of EUR 14.6 million .
Of course , we must not prejudge .
She gives one excuse after another .
The Community budget is not a matter of secrecy .
. ( NL ) Granting the European Commission discharge is anything but self-evident .
It should , however , realise that this does not create a precedent for the 1999 discharge .
Mrs Redondo has asked for the floor on a point of order .
I ask you to alter the voting order accordingly .
As you are aware , certain decisions are taken by the Conference of Presidents .
Usually , when voting time starts at midday it lasts for an hour .
Today , it started at 12.15 p.m. and ended at approximately 1.30 p.m.
The votes on the legislative drafts take up rather a lot of time .
In any case , this is not the appropriate time to discuss this subject .
That is a decision that was taken .
But if we do this , then we must also show some degree of flexibility .
The Thursday sitting in July is a particularly sensitive one .
We know that , we may not be happy about it , but that is how it is .
I do not have any objection to this .
Mr President , you are absolutely right , that is the correct procedure .
Rühle report ( A5-0167 / 2000 )
Mr President , I voted against the Rühle report .
There has to be an error of at least 3 decimal points .
We must keep a sense of proportion !
Our Group therefore considers it necessary , for the time being , to abstain .
Kuhne report ( A5-0189 / 2000 )
Papayannakis report ( A5-0193 / 2000 )
Europe was very slow to react and was left far behind in terms of beef .
They are correct .
Specifically mentioning the category is a response to a demand .
It contributes to restoring consumer confidence .
Two types of information must be distinguished :
As it is too specific , it can really only be read by professionals .
It fulfils a health function .
It is on the basis of these statements that controls can be carried out .
We are therefore talking about setting up identification and traceability systems ;
What do they want to know ?
But the citizen would also like to know what type of meat it is .
This type of indication on the label is addressed directly to the end consumer and gives him intelligible information .
It is a mistake to say that this is pointless .
On the contrary , this labelling is just as important as establishing health guarantees .
The confidence of our consumers cannot be decreed , it must be won .
Garcia-Orcoyen Tormo report ( A5-0165 / 2000 )
The criteria for inclusion on the EMAS register are very stringent .
I fully support this programme and commend this report .
Recommendation for second reading : Breyer ( A5-0166 / 2000 )
Workers should receive even greater protection .
Recommendation for second reading : Jackson ( A5-0164 / 2000 )
I would like to commend the rapporteur , Caroline Jackson , for her report .
The rapporteur believes that only a directive can force the Member States to introduce these inspection systems .
The EU Council must listen to the European Parliament in this regard .
Santa Maria da Feira European Council of 19 and 20 June 2000
I would remind you that this was not the case .
I know that opinion on the tax compromise that we just managed to negotiate in Feira is divided .
This is reflected in all the European press .
In this context , complaining that the timetable did not reflect the urgency of the problem is irresponsibly unrealistic .
Trafficking of human beings
The Dover tragedy happened between two European countries .
It is not enough to denounce the crooks that make money by trafficking in human beings .
Immigrants must be guaranteed the rights to which every human being should be entitled .
We must ensure the free movement of persons .
This was the spirit in which we tabled a motion for a resolution .
Mr President , I shall explain my vote in writing .
However , may I submit a procedural motion ?
Now , we have to wait .
Yesterday I waited 40 minutes to say that I was submitting my explanation of the vote in writing !
It is a waste of time .
The parliamentary services told me that I had to be here .
Perhaps you would have agreed ... nevertheless , could we not clarify things ?
Could you clarify that ?
Mrs Lulling , whose fault are you saying it is ?
Your fellow Members who are giving their explanations of vote ?
This is not the case .
I am saying this also as a representative of a country that is non-aligned .
What sort of a statement is this ?
( The sitting was suspended at 1.50 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Topical and urgent debate
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
Mr Maaten has the floor for a point of order .
This Rule also stipulates that such a motion shall be put to the vote immediately .
This is not like a referral back to committee .
Consequently , the urgent matter is either accepted or refused .
Madam President , there are nonetheless groups which support Mr Maaten ' s motion .
I would thus ask you to proceed to the vote in line with the Rules of Procedure .
Topical and urgent matters are a very specific case .
As soon as a matter becomes urgent , it cannot be postponed .
New arguments have emerged in this instance .
We now know that the Dutch justice system is launching an inquiry .
We now have new information , which we need to take into account .
All the arguments have been expressed on the subject of this postponement .
Fiji and the Solomon Islands
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
The same thing is happening in the nearby Solomon Islands and all over the world .
The interim civilian administration installed in Fiji does not meet the constitutional or democratic tests .
The ACP-EU delegation went to the Solomon Islands to study the ethnic tension .
It was quite clear after talks that a coup was imminent .
Why did it happen ?
When we arrived we found a complete vacuum .
There was no dialogue between the warring parties .
The parliament was not functioning .
99.9 % of Guadalcanal is held by the IMF group and only Honiara City is held by the Malaitans .
This situation is unsustainable .
As they did all the work , Guadalcanal is now at a standstill in both rural and urban areas .
The presence of Mrs Kinnock and myself did influence the situation for the better .
We created dialogue .
We had the 48-hour resignation demand on the prime minister withdrawn .
Amazingly the leader of the opposition is now the prime minister .
That aid is 25 % of their GDP .
But the country is bankrupt and the new prime minister will face the same problems as the last .
Outside help will also be needed to regain law and order .
Today , the reality is far sadder .
We are well aware , however , that the true cause is not just that .
In the Solomon Islands , the vast majority of the population is Melanesian and Christian .
Moreover , in spite of these differences , all these people are at home in Fiji .
I believe there are causes other than this ethnic conflict .
As for the new Prime Minister , he is also from a business background .
These two examples support our vision of the conflict .
The joint resolution , however , is too sanctimonious and effectively wants to restore the previous situation .
This is how we might succeed in changing things .
Madam President , my comments will be on the question of Fiji .
Their concern was not precisely for the ethnic Indian community , it was for Fiji .
Fiji had a multi-racial constitution in 1997 .
It was a model for a constitution for a multi-racial society and a thriving island .
The concerns expressed are very real .
It really is discouraging to see the achievements of an entire decade put at risk .
Fiji had a constitution that was not based on racism .
That has been abolished .
It had a democratically elected government .
That has fallen and been replaced by an interim government appointed by the military .
Fiji has already suffered enormous economic damage at this point .
There is a risk that investors will lose confidence in it .
It even risks being expelled from the Commonwealth .
Let me remind you that this proposal initially provides for consultations between the parties .
Any response on our part should be well-considered and targeted .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following joint motions for resolutions :
This is a battle of law , and of international law .
Today , in Tibet , there is a non-violent fight for democracy .
China is a large country which has a right to democracy .
Madam President , happy birthday Dalai Lama !
In the light of this , I would like to make the following observations .
All manner of so-called indirect contacts have led to nothing .
This has to be prevented and hence this resolution .
Surely we cannot offer the Tibetan population attention only when it suits us ?
If public monies are spent , the justification for doing so must be made just as public .
The full autonomy granted to Tibet must finally be guaranteed .
That includes freedom of religion , freedom of opinion , cultural and social independence .
Bilateral talks must be held with authorised leaders .
The Dalai Lama is available for this at any time .
It is high time to hold constructive dialogues on that basis .
Tashi delek !
This is why I am addressing the Commissioner .
How can we justify spending taxpayers ' money on this kind of practice ?
In our opinion , it is essential for Parliament to speak out against the World Bank 's decision .
We think that the Tibetans should have the autonomy that they themselves are striving for .
We are also concerned about China ' s unwillingness to participate in a dialogue .
Decisions must , of course , be made by no later than tomorrow .
It is , of course , usually quite difficult to have any influence on the World Bank at all .
The Council is , of course , not represented here to any great extent .
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
Child soldiers in Uganda
Situation in the Moluccas
Death penalty in the United States
Child soldiers in Uganda
Madam President , Commissioner , one could say a lot about this issue .
This solution is the so-called diamond resolution in the Security Council .
We have the voluntary Supplementary Protocol against Child Soldiers and the Activities in Africa .
I would ask the House to support this resolution .
Their favourite victims are children and adolescents because they are vulnerable and easily influenced .
Nor does it hesitate to sexually exploit women and girls .
When these children survive , it must be said , they are in any case scarred for life .
It takes time , patience and love to restore their hope .
Madam President , we must also stop pussyfooting around .
Sudan must stop supporting the LRA .
In my opinion , this amounts to collusion , which makes Sudan just as guilty .
The whole population is waiting for this solution and all the children are hoping for it .
The Security Council must hear this plea .
Madam President , I am really pleased that this resolution has come about .
I hope that this will encourage the Commission and the Member States to act on this issue .
Some weeks ago , a documentary from Southern Sudan was shown on Swedish television .
There , they use child soldiers from Uganda , who are forced into armed conflict .
We must put pressure on the international oil companies and on investors .
Such action is a matter of great priority .
This brings me to the wider issue of the United Nations .
The protocol was accepted in the General Assembly in May .
In July , a debate will be held in the Security Council .
We do a great deal financially in this respect in different countries .
We have a good reputation there .
It would be beneficial if we could act under one banner and with one voice .
Situation in the Moluccas
Madam President , the Moluccas require our attention once again .
The peaceful coexistence of Muslims and Christians , which lasted for years , seems to be broken for good .
The brave attitude of President Wahid should not go unmentioned .
Last week , he even dared criticise the position of the members of parliament .
It still requires a great deal of effort to identify the fundamentalist elements of whatever religious grouping .
I would like to make a few specific recommendations to the Indonesian Government .
In addition , the deployment of international peacekeeping forces deserves to be reconsidered .
A humanitarian corridor is essential in this respect .
This is about relieving the real suffering that is pervading the Moluccas .
Madam President , I wonder whether history is repeating itself in Indonesia .
The bloody confrontations between Muslims and Christians are jeopardising safety within the Moluccas .
This is reminiscent of East Timor only a few months ago .
Only yesterday , the Jihad fighters burnt down two housing estates in Ambon .
More than anything , however , the Union should be more pro-active .
This is also the thrust of the resolution and I would like a sound response from the European Commission .
On the other hand there are special police troops , which back the Christians .
It is vital to support the Wahid government at present .
This is our urgent request .
Madam President , I think that Mrs Maij-Weggen is quite right to call the situation catastrophic .
Death penalty in the United States
The name of the Governor of Virginia has been missed off the list of recipients of the resolution .
Yes , Mr Manisco , you are absolutely right .
In the text of the resolution , reference was made to this State .
Madam President , we can all put our signatures to what is written in the resolution .
This year , this demand was repeated .
According to the information that I have , this involves 3 670 people .
In the resolution , we point to the prevailing legal uncertainty in the present cases .
I therefore urge my fellow Members to support these amendments .
I am myself a great lover of the United States and many aspects of its way of life .
Mr President , the case of Derek Rocco Barnabei makes our resolution all the more urgent .
And it is precisely these merits that make the continuation of this barbaric ritual so very shocking .
Mr President , football is a festival .
However , the festival was , once again , overshadowed by the behaviour of some alleged supporters .
Serious riots broke out , especially before and after the Germany-England match .
Some people , including certain delegates in this House , are trying to trivialise the issue .
Germany set a good example in this respect .
Let us draw the right conclusions from the events in Brussels and Charleroi .
Hooliganism has transcended all borders , both literally and figuratively speaking .
The journalists were prevented from doing their job and were beaten up , thrown to the ground and arrested .
Everyone was terribly concerned about violence and trouble and such like .
They managed to do this to a very limited extent .
Thirdly , I should like to mention the Italian incident .
I am therefore very much in favour of the Dutch authorities launching a thorough inquiry .
Thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
Their nationality is of little importance .
This is the best approach to take on the matter .
As I see it , stressed out police and stewards clearly went beyond their remits .
What exactly happened to the disabled Italian supporters ?
Were people informed that so many would turn up ?
Did these handicapped supporters not want to be filmed or were they not allowed to be filmed ?
These kinds of questions need to be investigated and the Dutch Government has assented to such an investigation .
Until such time , until the outcome of the investigation , I will refrain from passing judgement .
It is absolutely not worth it .
Instant sanctions must be taken in the countries where they commit crimes .
All Member States should , in consultation with each other , take appropriate measures .
I would now like to say a few words on the events which unfolded in Rotterdam .
Naturally , an investigation is necessary because the accusations are very serious .
This inquiry is under way .
Consequently , I believe that the amendments pertaining to this matter should be rejected .
Kofi Annan is a good and honourable man .
The EU must speak out against sanctions which amount to virtual genocide .
The alleged purpose of the sanctions is to get rid of Saddam Hussein .
He is still there ten years later .
We must remember that this is a country that has the second largest oil reserve in the world .
Operating theatres have raw sewage dripping in , and out-of-date equipment .
We are witnessing the slow strangulation of a wonderful nation and a wonderful people .
I would have far preferred discussing a text which strikes more of a balance .
In our opinion , the text we submitted originally would have formed a much better base for a discussion .
Is this also being distributed ?
Yes , of course .
Mr President , Iraq was at war with Iran from 1980 to 1989 .
Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990 .
This was wrong and unacceptable .
The UN responded by passing Resolution 661 to impose sanctions on Iraq .
The UN action was justified .
The USA and Britain imposed a no-fly zone in April 1991 .
In 1994 , Iraq recognised the territorial integrity of Kuwait .
If the sanctions were intended to dislodge Saddam Hussein , this has not still been achieved after ten years .
The intellectual embargo has deprived doctors , teachers and other professionals of the advances in science and technology .
I hope that this House will vote in favour of this resolution .
This is intellectual genocide .
The head of the World Aid Program has said so .
We must trust the Iraqi people to bring about democracy in Iraq !
It is extremely important .
How we can allow illegal bombing like this to continue is just beyond credibility .
The infrastructure in Iraq has been completely decimated .
Again , the victims here are innocent people who have no power whatsoever .
We cannot lose sight of them either .
With today ' s debate and this new resolution we are seeking to achieve three further objectives .
Mr President , one minute is a very short time for such a serious topic .
This attack does not bode well for the future .
This is immensely dangerous and worrying for the new century .
Mr President , who could not feel sorry for the sorely tried population of Iraq ?
The political ramifications of their intention are , however , a missed opportunity .
Allow me to be more specific .
In other words , what is stopping Saddam from alleviating the suffering of his people ?
They know all too well what Saddam ' s pledges are really worth .
Those tabling this resolution cannot possibly have it in mind to raise this awful spectre .
Hence my explicit vote against .
Iraq deserves better than the Commission reply .
I am absolutely horrified .
I wish to express total dissatisfaction with the reply of the Commission .
That is all .
Perfect , that is one in favour and one against .
We thank the Commissioner who does not want to speak .
Let us be brief and we will all move on .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
This issue of Venezuela is serious and urgent .
I believe this Parliament is stretching the bounds of its credibility .
Mr President , this issue raises a problem which goes much further than the resolution on Venezuela .
The problem involves the preservation of Parliament ' s capacity to respond to this type of situation .
This is the debate surrounding the 2001 budget and it was the debate surrounding the 2000 budget .
Mr President , more than six months have now passed since the tragic floods in Venezuela .
It was something that you had to see with your own eyes to believe .
Only a few roads have been cleared .
Thousands of them are still dependent on food aid to survive .
It is vital to replace the thousands of jobs destroyed by the floods .
The Venezuelan Government will need a great deal of support if it is to succeed in this Herculean task .
We therefore urge the Commission to provide a significant financial contribution over the next five years .
This aid is directed at two things .
First , it is aimed at supporting reconstruction in the federal state of Vargas .
I can understand people being impatient because progress is so slow in some areas .
But the Venezuelan Government has not proposed any projects to us .
That is not meant as some kind of covert criticism .
It is probably difficult for the Venezuelan Government to decide very quickly what the priorities should be .
The results are now before us .
After all , we cannot print it ourselves , as you know .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
It is a delicate matter when a Socialist from Austria does this , but by no means urgent .
He should be pleased about that , as I and many others are .
So what is the point of all this , Mr Swoboda ?
That is shameful for an Austrian and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms !
We are also talking about a challenge issued by Haider to the Community as a whole .
In response , we must give Mr Pelinka our total support .
Perhaps we should not be surprised at what has happened .
Now he ( Häider ) is threatening us . "
But he is not threatening anybody .
It is quite normal .
The wise men have a hard task in front of them over the coming six months .
It is because this resolution is too weak that we will not vote for it .
Allow me to address a comment to the GUE Group and the PSE Group .
The main thing is to make it clear and today we are not clear .
The EPP Group also took part in the discussions and decisions on the present resolution .
That is a disgraceful attitude !
Who has actually seen Mr Pelinka ' s letter of resignation ?
Who knows the real circumstances of his resignation ?
Every state governed by the rule of law provides for constitutional legal measures .
It must be combated by every means available wherever it arises .
That applies particularly to this case , which falls outside the scope of EU legislation .
That concludes the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
Before the vote on child soldiers in Uganda :
Mr President , we agreed a joint motion for a resolution , on which five groups collaborated .
Once the document was finished , a sixth group joined in .
Therefore the signature can stand .
But I would suggest that this be looked into for the future .
Before the vote on Venezuela :
We cannot have two different procedures being applied in the same week .
For the rest , we support this resolution because we helped draft it .
I fully understand what you are saying .
We could carry on this way , but we would be wasting time .
The President has already replied .
It seems to me that he is absolutely right .
I do not want any further debate .
We will look into this matter .
Mr President , on a point of order .
There are certainly a number of amendments where we need further clarification .
I would like to hear whether this is actually a legal procedure for us to be voting on now .
All the amendments have been checked and approved by the services so we will vote on them now .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
That concludes the vote .
The accident which has taken place in Spain is really very serious .
I will make sure that the President is fully apprised of that and that is so done .
We need to have more information about the full extent of the tragedy .
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Redondo Jiménez report ( A5-0152 / 2000 )
This is certainly a positive measure .
The amendments to the regulation on protecting forests against fires are particularly important for Portugal .
I shall give my own personal view of the report on forests .
I also know that we cannot rob Peter to pay Paul .
Only 10 % of the surface area destroyed in Greece is reforested .
But the problems have not been solved .
On the contrary , they have multiplied .
Such a policy is not merely hypocritical .
It is aiding and abetting fire .
We shall not give up .
Surely they will not use these phthalates for other purposes ?
For objects that might be used by pensioners or the elderly ?
Or for some other purpose ?
I would be extremely concerned if this were the case .
The content of the decision on labelling , therefore , goes beyond the scientific grounds for the directive .
( FR ) I have a special interest in the matter of toy safety .
What has the European Commission proposed ?
This is , of course , completely inadequate .
As every parent knows , young children put absolutely everything in their mouths .
The threat that phthalates may pose to human health has not been proven scientifically .
Hieronymi Report ( A5-0186 / 2000 )
However , this is a job for the private film industry and the Member States themselves .
We take note of your observation , Mr Mastorakis .
Sanders-ten Holte Report ( A5-0185 / 2000 )
Mombaur Report ( A5-0180 / 2000 )
The rapporteur ' s attitude is the exact opposite of this .
We have therefore voted against this report .
( FR ) As a new Member of the European Parliament , let me say how shocked I am .
It is all the more unacceptable , given that there are still problems !
I could carry on like this at great length .
This is simply a way of making it easier to shift assets to large companies .
Generating electricity is not the same as producing a simple commodity .
These firms are no longer strictly national ; nor are their shareholders " .
The GUE / NGL MEPs have therefore voted against Mr Mombaur 's report .
Mr Mombauer ' s excellent report hits home regarding several points .
Radwan Report ( A5-0169 / 2000 )
Although that is true , it is not a sufficient reason .
How do European leaders intend to combat this depreciation ?
This will not change a great deal in the short term .
In any event , a deadlock is being imposed on the system at the same time .
This venture is helping to take us to a point where we lose our freedoms .
Karas Report ( A5-0170 / 2000 )
In such circumstances , it is not surprising that the euro has been easy to establish in this phase .
In such circumstances , indeed , why should we hold back ?
Money is something in which it is necessary to have confidence .
I reject the Karas report in its entirety .
How far we were then from seeing it as the key element in the process of integration !
This is where blind federalism takes us !
Lambert Report ( A5-0162 / 2000 )
The Ombudsman and his colleagues are not , however , the right people to meet these challenges .
Atkins Report ( A5-0162 / 2000 )
This part-session has produced a rich crop of reports on transport .
This was the cause of the French air traffic controllers ' strike last week .
This was how they expressed their concerns about a purely commercial view of their profession .
It is pathetic !
No one can deny that the air traffic situation has deteriorated .
France wishes to keep these activities in the public sector .
That just goes to show !
The pretext for driving forward this liberalisation , furthermore , is delays in flights .
This should be the priority and the guidelines on the single European sky .
- ( NL ) The aviation sector has traditionally been organised in a particularly liberal manner .
Airfares bear out this freedom too .
There is little left to be liberalised in this sector .
The current proposals do not address this problem .
From this critical stance , we tabled 11 amendments .
Why has this never been challenged ?
It is for all these reasons that I voted against this report .
Damião Report ( A5-0141 / 2000 )
Maternity is not an illness .
Point 11 in particular contains many positive proposals .
Let this remain a national issue !
The prohibition of night work for women is a right acquired by the working movement in France .
To revoke this would be a retrograde step in social terms .
To speak of equality between men and women is hypocrisy .
Women must be protected against any wrongful dismissal and their former wage must be guaranteed .
Short sea shipping
The rapporteur , Mrs Peijs , has the floor .
The second annual progress report on this draft is now before us .
We are not trying to boost the popularity of short sea shipping out of idealistic motives .
It is a fact that transport shipping will increase by 70 % in the next decade .
It is impossible to meet this growing demand by road transport alone .
Speed might not be the main feature of short sea shipping , safety is .
Weekend traffic bans and traffic jams are a curse to road transport .
At the same time , I do not want to claim here that it is a panacea .
But in order to do this , a number of conditions do need to be met .
In its communication , the Commission makes a distinct reference to industry itself .
This is fine , but as rapporteur , I would like to add another dimension .
In its communication , the European Commission provided a sound overview of the issue as a whole .
We are still awaiting this report .
I would like to underline a few aspects .
Short sea shipping is also eminently suited to specialist transport . Cars are a good example of this .
The sector ' s image is also important and must clearly be cleaned up .
The sector is suffering from excessive red tape .
Procedures last forever .
But increasingly , we can also point to many positive developments within the sector .
Member States must lift obstructions .
At every level , excessive bureaucratic procedures and endless red tape accompany the cargo .
This puts short sea shipping at a disadvantage compared to other modes of transport .
The market is still fragmented at present .
Short sea shipping requires destinations .
Furthermore , we are lacking information and statistical data on which industry can base its investments .
No one knows what we transport in what way , where to and in what quantities .
The answer is : we have a vision .
We see large quantities of goods transported round our continent on safe , environmentally-friendly ships .
The goods are unloaded at the point where they can reach their destination via the shortest possible overland route .
That takes the burden off overland transport by adding another link to the chain of intermodal transport .
There was broad agreement in committee .
What can we do internally for short sea shipping ? I just want to mention a few things .
What can we do for short sea shipping as a link in the intermodal chain ?
I think we should also consider all these matters with a view to our pre-accession strategies .
Meanwhile we have the activity of the round tables .
The report says that an exchange of best practice would be useful .
All in all the report offers a whole package of sensible proposals .
Although these come from my own constituency , I know they are representative of many similar regions .
Good rail access into ports is vital in this context .
My group endorses Amendments Nos 1 and 4 accordingly .
Third , it is essential that we continue to recognise the lifeline nature of many short sea shipping routes .
I am not thinking just in terms of the need to sustain public service obligations in this context .
I hope the Commission will take such points into serious consideration when developing policy in the area .
In that case it would be quite lawful for the state to support the services there .
Earlier it had claimed intimate knowledge of the west of Scotland .
It still have not replied to that .
I ask it to reply as a matter of urgency .
Mr President , I would like to say the following on behalf of Mr van Dam .
Transport policy requires choices .
Sustainable transport policy requires even more , or at least other , choices .
I would like to highlight a number of aspects .
This is certainly true , relatively speaking .
If ports refuse to turn a ship , swift action is most definitely required .
Short sea shipping can take care of at least part of this .
A third aspect concerns the situation at ports .
In short , Mrs Peijs ' report is comprehensive and I would like to congratulate her on this .
I would like to thank Mrs Peijs for her interesting and excellent proposal .
On top of everything , our railways have a different gauge from those found elsewhere in the European Union .
This has led to a situation where we have had to establish a special fleet to break the ice .
They are powerful ships : one ship ' s energy is equivalent to that used by a whole city .
That is the problem .
I expect the Commission to look into this matter .
Mr President , I wish to congratulate Mrs Peijs on a successful report .
Mrs Peijs ' s splendid report aims at exploiting the opportunities offered by short sea shipping .
It is an important addition to the reports on railways and air traffic .
I wish to mention the importance of the suitability and availability of ports and port services .
Mr President , first of all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report .
We can see the different problems quite clearly from different areas of the European Union .
Each area has its own particular problem .
We have to recognise that it will take time to achieve our ultimate goal .
It is certainly sensible to ship more goods by sea rather than by road .
It is more environmentally friendly , more acceptable in every way .
But we have to ensure that we get the balance right .
That is what the rapporteur has been striving for .
One of the greatest problems will always be the cost factor .
I support Mrs Attwooll 's appeal for the A75 .
It is our main outlet for all we produce .
From Scotland they trundle down to England .
For our industry or agriculture to survive they have to be cost-effective .
There are , however , two points in your report that I have a problem with .
In the past we were guilty of talking short sea shipping down .
We mentioned its potential and by doing so implicitly said that it was not really doing very well .
But it is doing well .
So we must give credit to the short sea shipping industry .
However there is always room for improvement . The shipping industry is the first to acknowledge this .
Let me mention a few key issues in Mrs Peijs report .
We need a comprehensive approach to make this a genuine door-to-door concept .
It must be fully integrated in the transport chain and be offered through one-stop shops .
Several bottlenecks hamper the development of short sea shipping .
One area which has already been identified is the diversity of documents required .
It will even be more in the 2000 . We will increase the share up to 50 % .
Mr Purvis , has asked me to pass an invitation to Commissioner de Palacio .
I certainly will do that and Mrs Palacio will enjoy a romantic trip to Scotland .
It would be even more romantic if you would invite me to accompany her .
Mrs Peijs , thank you for your work .
Thank you for ensuring that we all move in the same direction .
Let us all do it together , the Commission will certainly do its best .
Thank you very much , Mr MacCormick .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Friday , at 9 a.m.
Mr Pronk has the floor .
You might be able to submit this to the Bureau for their consideration .
But this is , of course , not really related to these issues .
I do not need to add too many explanatory notes .
The European Commission has been aware of this for three years .
This is not the issue .
This issue is that so little is happening .
The reason for this could be that there are different Commission directorates involved .
NGOs are not restricted to one directorate general .
Speed is the main issue .
They are far more sensitive to this than other organisations , and certainly Member States .
This means that if we wait around for too long , the patient will die .
This is the serious concern which we have in our committee .
Mr President , I can be extremely brief .
I thought the response by the Commissioner was encouraging on its own merits .
This can only be stretched so far and speed is then of the essence .
As such , we are thus not asking for a new treaty , but for some attention .
As we know , we have been discussing the issue for years .
The Commission needs to start putting forward practical solutions , for otherwise the issue will never be resolved .
The NGOs in our view act as part of the preventive process .
They make us think of new things and they are essential to our process .
It is difficult to meet new needs while the Member States have this attitude .
There is , therefore , a place for non-governmental organisations .
One might imagine that such an organisation would escape some of the bureaucratic problems .
Financial supervision could be exercised by professional auditors .
Let me take just one example , the protection of childhood .
Our attempts have been ignored .
That , Commissioner , is what I wished to say .
We need time for this .
Mr President , Mrs Lambert and Mrs Ghilardotti are right .
These kinds of initiatives were recognised in the conclusions of the Lisbon summit .
But words are not enough and two years after the 1998 budget crisis , the difficulties continue .
Mr President , that has to change .
NGOs are critical to our work and we must support them .
I will pass them on and will raise them during the Commission ' s debate .
Let me just reply briefly to two points .
The first concerns the legal bases and the financing .
Otherwise it ought to be called a governmental rather than a non-governmental organisation .
That is quite fundamental .
A number of speakers have addressed the question of non-governmental organisations and enlargement .
I will answer them , because this matter is within my direct remit .
All the ideas I have heard put forward in this debate have long since become reality .
Thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .
( The sitting was closed at 9.08 p.m. )
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
We are therefore currently producing the remaining versions .
Therefore , when we have the remaining versions we will proceed with the approval of the Minutes .
I accidentally voted against it .
I would ask you to correct this .
This has been noted .
I think that what went on there last night must be investigated at any rate .
We will therefore notify our security services .
The President declared this not applicable to the topical debate .
Rule 146 was clearly cancelled out in that instance .
Yesterday ' s incident caused a great deal of confusion .
This means that the president of the sitting strictly applied the Rules of Procedure .
I have taken note of this peculiar point of order .
The President has decided to send our condolences to the families and to the respective authorities .
This will be done .
Mr Newton Dunn , I am afraid to say that this is not an original idea .
It is not the first time that it has been discussed .
We have taken the floor on many occasions .
I recall the subject of Tibet being discussed on the Dalai Lama ' s 65th birthday yesterday .
I would be surprised if today we were not in a position to do the same .
( FR ) We know that short sea shipping is an integral part of the European transport system .
I am thinking about traffic congestion problems , and high infrastructure and environmental costs .
We must therefore act quickly in order to contribute to its development .
In particular , we will have to develop joint investment programmes .
However , two points in my fellow Member ' s report pose a problem for me .
The European Commission should therefore develop an intermodal strategy to achieve complementarity between the modes of transport .
However , we still have a long way to go .
Combating serious environmental crime
How is this to happen ?
That is extremely important .
It is important to try to cooperate as much as possible in this area .
We have tried to include such circumstances by means of Amendment 16 .
This may be found in Amendment 25 .
I am in favour of the Framework Decision and of the amendments which have been tabled .
It is a logical continuation of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Council of Ministers ' summit in Tampere .
It is a classic area requiring cooperation .
It is important to have regulations in criminal law so that we can prevent environmental crime .
I think this is something we should study in the future .
Who has misled whom ?
These are very complicated , very interesting and very important questions .
This has a knock-on effect on other companies as well .
Moreover it is not just companies .
It seems that profit comes before the interests of the public and the environment .
How long is that going to take to rectify ?
The Erika is another example of negligence .
I would also like to support the last speaker who talked about animal transport .
This is deliberate exploitation and ill-treatment of animals and should be taken into account as well .
Cost-cutting and cutting corners caused the biggest environmental disaster in history .
That company still has not been held properly and legally responsible .
It was taken to court in India .
The head of the company was supposed to be arrested and a warrant was issued for his arrest .
Then there are the issues of forestry and fishing .
The effects of environmental crime spread into the territory of many countries .
The importation and exportation of crimes does not recognise the EU ' s external borders .
The crimes are often committed by a corporate body .
The crimes are often perpetrated in a spirit of profit-making .
The perpetrator makes the profit ; external costs are left for others to pay .
It is not hard to support a policy that makes it easier to combat environmental crime .
Publicity is also one way of combating environmental criminality .
I will end by extending my congratulations once more to the rapporteur , Mr Di Lello Finuoli .
Hence it is preferable for various Member States to sign and ratify the Council of Europe ' s Convention .
My question to the Council of Ministers is whether it would be prepared to go this extra mile .
Even if we can agree on a sound definition , the application will be difficult in practice .
Was the Erika disaster an example of environmental crime ?
And what about the cyanide pollution in Romania ?
It was a clear case of extensive environmental damage , but do the other criteria apply too ?
It is important that liability for these acts eventually falls to those responsible .
It would be useful if this issue could be included in the White Paper on environmental liability .
Mr President , naturally I am interested in the European Commission ' s view .
Could Commissioner Schreyer clarify this rather odd procedure which we have ended up with ?
Regrettably such disasters affect many countries at the same time .
We know only too well that major environmental disasters respect no international frontiers .
Multinational firms will only change their behaviour when they are forced to pay heavily for their misdeeds .
They will continue to inflict damage on the environment when the rewards far exceed the punishment .
I therefore welcome this initiative that acknowledges the international nature of environmental damage .
It recognises the need for strong punitive sanctions .
In particular the criminalisation of environmental damage will send a clear warning to those responsible for it .
We are therefore arriving at a final proposal that we consider to be both reasonable and ambitious .
The second matter is the need to consider the international dimension of the crime .
I think that this will be an important task for the Commission .
We have to prevent criminal responsibilities from being blurred .
It is remarkable , however , how small a proportion of the reports subsequently lead to guilty verdicts .
I do not think that this is in any way unique to Sweden .
If that is the case , then that is , of course , quite unacceptable .
Major financial interests are often at stake .
Altering this state of affairs is perhaps the most important change which can be made .
Coordination as a result of this initiative is , of course , also necessary .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Save the Planet !
This is a mission which we have to accomplish .
Sustainability is a really important concept , particularly in times like these .
However , I should particularly like to come back to Amendment No 3 , which concerns the profit motive .
The profit motive is also something completely natural and sensible .
We are in favour of high salaries , so we also need to make profits .
We would need it to be defined precisely .
The threat of imprisonment is an approach that really threatens a person ' s livelihood !
However , training and certification are obviously necessary too .
We have already spoken about EMAS this week .
If we follow this positive route via incentives , then we will really be protecting our planet .
This cannot be allowed to continue .
As usual , of course , the devil is in the detail .
All can be resolved , but some will have to wait .
This proposal suffers from the same problems we have too often in the European Union .
Mr President , yesterday we debated and voted on a report from the Committee on Petitions .
This year that Committee has dealt with a thousand complaints from citizens .
Forty percent of those one thousand complaints are associated with violations of Community environmental law .
I believe that this report covers three important aspects .
We believe that the crimes are often clearly premeditated .
I well remember the case of Doñana in Spain or of the Danube .
Secondly , Mr President , I feel that penalties are essential .
I am in no doubt about this .
Some of the Members here today shed doubt on the need for penalties .
I do not . I think that even the ' polluter pays ' principle is a partial one .
Thirdly , the natural environment should be regenerated .
It is therefore essential to regenerate the damaged environment , and also for legal persons to be liable .
To conclude , Mr President , I would like to mention cooperation between states , which is essential .
It is definitely so that when the fines are small , environmental crime becomes lucrative .
The framework decision would prevent this sort of crime from being profitable .
Some of these are repeatedly found guilty of these crimes .
Consumers and people in general could then bring public opinion to bear on the situation .
Obviously , we must regard environmental crimes as seriously as we regard all other criminal acts .
Common definitions of environmental crime are therefore also needed .
It puts forward a minimum standard with regard to criminal acts .
Of course , the Commission takes the view that this must be developed further .
The Commission very much welcomes the first part of Denmark ' s initiative .
A serious breach of environmental law is therefore not necessarily punishable in every Member State .
This is then naturally to some extent an incentive for cross ­ border environmental crimes .
The Danish initiative provides that legal persons must be made responsible under criminal law for serious environmental offences .
This is also included .
There was in fact unanimous agreement on this in this very interesting debate .
This was once again borne out in this report .
We have established that as yet , Europol has no authority whatsoever to act .
" Do not worry " , I said , " Today is Friday 7 July .
On Fridays we normally discuss fish , and today we are discussing the sea . "
I can only hope that the rest of the debate and the report are more accurate than Mrs McKenna .
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
We will now proceed to the approval of the Minutes from yesterday ' s sitting .
Are there any comments ?
It will be duly corrected , Mrs Laguiller .
There is no record of this in the verbatim report of proceedings .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mrs Lulling , we are approving the Minutes .
( The Minutes were approved )
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
( The sitting was closed at 10.40 a.m. )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday , 7 July 2000 .
Statement by the President
On each of these sad occasions , I expressed our solidarity with the victims .
I have expressed our condemnation of these unspeakably barbaric acts .
I have also offered the Spanish authorities our support .
To deny the right to life is to kill liberty .
Please stand and observe this minute ' s silence .
( The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence )
- Madam President , unfortunately I cannot agree with what you have said .
There is no truth except the whole truth .
A part of reality is not sufficient by itself .
The whole is the only real truth .
This is much more than a metaphysical quotation from Hegel .
This is actually the Spanish Government 's strategy towards the Basque country .
( The President cut the speaker off )
( Loud applause )
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Madam President , on a point of order .
Mr Murphy , I note your statement .
In fact , that should really have been a procedural motion .
Thank you , Mr Bradbourn , I shall happily take note of this comment .
All of us here today know what a problem it is to get to Strasbourg .
If we arrive an hour late , they clearly cannot be expected to wait for us .
I would ask you to speak to Air France .
Mrs González Álvarez , as you know , I am well aware of all these problems .
Believe me , I am continually informing the relevant authorities , both governmental and airport , of our problems .
You all received a questionnaire .
I am yet to receive any reply in this regard .
This will be the appropriate opportunity for you to state your case .
I shall be happy to do so , Mrs Napoletano .
Thank you , Mrs Gillig .
Mr García , I apologise . We shall make the correction .
We had not understood that you wished to speak regarding the Minutes .
But I am surprised that the House is not debating Burma on this day .
They do have freedom of speech .
Madam President , I am afraid I must raise this issue again .
Mrs Lynne , thank you for making this point .
To reply to what you said to me , the regulations are already in place .
European Parliament rules have been drawn up , and we are not abiding by them .
I need hardly say that I am totally against smoking as an ageing ex-nurse .
I have personally gone round to both Members and visitors to ask them to put out their cigarettes .
I promise you that this is something that we shall certainly sort out .
These are therefore important matters .
The next item is the order of business .
Relating to Monday :
This is simply impossible because we need to discuss this in our groups .
Madam President , I would like to speak against this proposal .
Mrs Terrón , there is clearly a technical problem here .
All the language versions will be available tomorrow morning .
I see that Mr Poettering agrees with this .
So , if the texts are indeed available tomorrow morning , we shall vote on Wednesday .
Relating to Tuesday :
We need to refute an impression of this kind in the strongest possible terms !
I want to make two points absolutely clear .
These are the strong views of the Commission , including my colleague Mr Verheugen .
We want that message to go out loud and clear to all the enlargement candidates .
Mr Verheugen was trying to make that point very strongly .
The point that the honourable Member raised expresses a legitimate and understandable concern .
I will relay it to Commissioner Verheugen .
( Applause )
Madam President , I am very grateful to the Commissioner for his statement .
To some extent it addresses the matter and to some extent it fails to do so .
That is why this matter is of exceptional political importance this week .
Our citizens need it and so does Parliament .
I am speaking here as a German and as the acting chairman of my group .
Commissioner Patten has already outlined the Commission 's views on Mr Verheugen 's comments .
For me , that would actually suffice as a Commission position .
Madam President , I should like to declare myself in favour of Mr Poettering ' s proposal .
Commissioner Verheugen should indeed come and address the House to offer some explanation .
We are not about to start a debate on this matter . I shall put this proposal to him .
But we do not insist on this .
Relating to Wednesday :
Who wishes to speak in support of this request ?
On several occasions since the advent of Dolly we have voted on a number of resolutions .
I refer to Rule 118 of the Rules of Procedure .
There are Parliament resolutions in which we have made our views on cloning very clear .
That was also true of therapeutic cloning !
In actual fact we have already discussed this and Parliament has always been opposed to it .
The votes were always controversial .
Those who now want to prevent the debate and a resolution have always represented a liberal standpoint .
But a majority of Parliament has always adopted an uncompromising position .
( Parliament rejected the proposal )
Relating to Thursday : President .
I shall therefore put the request from the group of the Greens to the vote .
( Parliament gave its assent )
Who wishes to speak in support of this request ?
I believe this to be a matter of great importance .
( Parliament rejected the request ) President .
The order of business is adopted thus amended .
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
Having expressed these reservations , I shall summarise the MEDA programme .
I shall then give my opinion of the proposed regulation , as well as the report as a whole .
As for Libya , for obvious reasons , it only has observer status .
The national and regional funding plans will be adopted annually on the basis of indicative programmes .
Specifically , the intention is to develop common harmonised procedures for all aid programmes .
There has been particular criticism of sub-contracting associations such as RTM .
This particularly concerns Lebanon , Algeria , Syria , etc .
At least EUR 10 million must be allocated annually for water .
We should support each country ' s sustainable development plans .
Thanks , too , to Mr Patten ' s colleagues , especially Mr Patrick Laurent .
The second idea which was restored was the harnessing of financial resources that were adequate to the challenges .
Mr Valdivielso de Cué has done excellent work on all these points .
The Commission ' s proposal looks at the question of migration from a strictly negative point of view .
In this respect it is critically important that the funding should be properly applied .
Our amendment urges the Member State parliaments which have not yet ratified the agreement to hasten this process .
As Mr Valdivielso pointed out in his speech , the EU has a large trade surplus with this area .
Our friends in these countries understandably question our sincerity .
The deep schism that divides the Mediterranean world is obvious .
The Conference of Barcelona was the European Union ' s reaction to it .
Many reasons have been given for this .
I prefer to look forward .
We agree absolutely with this .
In this regard you have our support , Commissioner .
( The President cut the speaker off . )
What role does MEDA have to play in this ?
What a discrepancy between the aid promised and the aid actually provided !
More credit should be provided for smaller-scale projects .
The MEDA programme also raises fundamental questions about our Euro-Mediterranean policy in general .
( The President cut the speaker off )
An evaluation of MEDA I and the wording of MEDA II clearly demonstrate the need for this .
In particular , this programme lacks cohesion and has been insufficiently implemented .
The sluggish pace of implementation is not the fault of the committees , in any case .
They are responsible for a delay of five months at most .
No , it is the procedures within the Commission that are largely to blame for the delay .
Transparency and control are important aspects that will enhance the quality of MEDA projects .
And the standard of quality required varies from project to project to this day .
May these reports and this debate help to realise these lofty ambitions .
This requires ongoing dialogue with the regions that are lagging behind .
These regions must be able to prosper on the basis of their own potential .
It would be good to move on from here .
This cannot be guaranteed merely by swelling administration .
This is not what I want to happen to you .
Mr Patten , stick to your guns !
Parliament ought to support you on this .
We should secure this position and defend it !
In Parliament you should have an ally here !
Meanwhile the greatest migratory impact originates from these countries .
What European policies do we have to combat desertification ?
We have no clear policy on this issue .
The same thing is happening with many other industrial projects .
In this respect , I believe it is a mistake to turn to large projects .
I would like to end with a reference to the agricultural sector .
I thought that Mr Linkohr made some extremely pertinent and challenging points .
Mr Piétrasanta 's report is also favourable towards the 1998 MEDA Programme report .
It makes no sense to treat MEDA differently .
The economic growth of these countries is of key importance to their political and social stabilisation .
We have an absorption problem with some of our partners .
We all have to move faster if we are to make a greater success of the programme .
That may save me a bit of work if I am doing the votes later in the week .
Now let me comment briefly on Mr Piétrasanta 's report .
We believe this is something for the Council and the Commission to consider together .
They are extremely resource-intensive in terms of management .
It will be apparent from what I have said that we are thinking very much along the same lines .
Let me make two final points .
My concern is that we should deliver that assistance more effectively and more rapidly .
That is simply not tolerable .
I pay great tribute to the French Presidency for giving this issue the priority it has .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will be taken on Wednesday at 12 noon .
Common Community diplomacy
We propose basically to make decisive progress in three areas .
Firstly , by improving the training of Community officials intended to be involved in carrying out external actions .
The Commission delegations have seen a dramatic quantitative and qualitative expansion over recent years .
Furthermore , this would represent a considerable reduction in costs .
We are simply proposing a more effective use of the competencies which have already been granted .
Naturally this will directly affect the way in which these European missions are assessed .
Therefore we cannot tolerate having ineffective diplomats in situ .
Naturally this must proceed under the supervision of the Commissioner who has responsibility for these affairs .
A common military force is being created .
Amongst these I would highlight the globalisation of the international economy and the financial markets .
What better instrument than diplomacy can there be for promoting objectives of peace and of reconciling national interests ?
The wealth and diversity of diplomatic experience in the various countries of Europe is also recognised throughout the world .
We have therefore tabled a number of amendments which we hope Parliament can accept .
This means that the message we send to the European citizens can only be contradictory .
I hope that others will also support these amendments .
What is the real issue here ?
Let us be logical about this .
Ultimately , Europe can speak with one voice only if it has nothing to say .
Unfortunately , the report does not address these issues .
These are the real questions .
Only occasionally does the rapporteur display any sense of reality .
The rapporteur rationalises his intention at the very beginning of his report .
Does this really amount to nothing more than a coordination problem ?
As if the divergent national interests of the Member States had already been consigned to the European past !
The opposite is true .
Mr Galeote Quecedo makes the same point himself in his explanatory statement .
I believe that this report represents a move in the right direction .
Equally clearly , these alone are not enough .
We also need policies .
Something of the sort hangs over today ' s debate .
But we must be clear that there are no vacuums in life .
There is quite a lot of double-talk here tonight .
You only need to look at the number of , for example , British embassies abroad .
Britain has twice as many embassies as either France or Germany .
It has a huge diplomatic corps which reflects its colonial past .
What happens if you have a single European diplomatic presence abroad ?
We abolish national embassies .
I believe that there are grave dangers in what we are doing .
This is all about competition .
It is about being able to compete with other superpowers .
I do not approve of the idea that Europe should create another superpower .
The idea of competing with the US is completely unacceptable .
If you look at the report itself , it is geared towards facilitating the common foreign and security policy .
If the proposals were pursued , we would have another building block in the construction of a European State .
Mr Patten has just made reference to this .
Management personnel is what we need in the delegations .
There is no recognition of this in the Galeote Quecedo report .
Yes , the Commission needs to recruit a different sort of personnel .
This occasion was no exception , and a meeting was indeed arranged .
There is an urgent need for this .
The embassy can provide them with a service in their own language .
What exactly does this mean , Mr Galeote Quecedo and Commissioner Patten ?
Paragraph 1 - the setting up of a College of European Diplomacy .
Sweden and many other countries have proud traditions in the United Nations .
Let us continue along these lines .
I am not sceptical , and I should like to warmly congratulate Mr Galeote Quecedo on his report .
I am , however , rather surprised at the strange scenarios depicted by some of the honourable members here .
What is this really about ?
And I believe that this would allow the person to do their job even more successfully .
Seen from this point of view , it is good if we already start making appropriate preparations now .
I want to assure Parliament that we will consider its recommendations very carefully .
I want to pay particular tribute to Mr Galeote Quecedo .
It is already a subject in which we have been taking a keen interest .
The communication updates the list of priorities for the opening of new delegations and offices .
This is closely linked to our efforts to reform our external assistance programmes .
The communication makes it clear that what it proposes is only a first step .
But we will have fewer people in Brussels and more people in the field .
We will be preparing a follow-up communication on the external services in the first half of next year .
Let me comment specifically on Mr Galeote Quecedo 's report .
We are already in contact with many of them and we will seek to deepen that relationship .
I am not convinced of the need to formalise this state of affairs since it exists already .
I do not want to complicate procedures further , but again I am open-minded on the issue .
There are regular meetings at all levels .
We have a programme of secondment of Member States officials and diplomats to our delegations .
I want to underline the importance of coordination .
I strongly suspect that we will have fifteen foreign ministers in the European Union for the foreseeable future .
A final plea .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Patten .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow , at 12.30 p.m.
EC investment partners financial instrument
However , we do criticise the way in which it has been implemented .
Nevertheless , the Deloitte & Touche appraisal report highlights a series of grave shortcomings which need to be tackled .
But as my colleague and friend , Mrs Theato , has mentioned , it is full of worms .
The reason for that is simple .
Similarly , business partners were not informed of the possible termination of the programme .
All that has changed is the fact that the programmes now advocate coordinated action for this capital .
The results obtained so far are encouraging .
Certain hopes and expectations , however , have been left behind .
Let me commence with a bit of background .
The ECIP instrument operated successfully for 12 years , from 1988 to 1999 .
Mr Dell 'Alba 's report contains extremely helpful suggestions in this respect .
We are presently engaged in a comprehensive review of all our existing financial instruments .
The Commission therefore proposes to evaluate all the options by June of next year and then make proposals .
The honourable gentleman has been generous , courteous and understanding .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Patten .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow , at 12.30 p.m.
Community humanitarian activities
The European public and the beneficiaries should be told about this remarkable work by ECHO .
Mr President , the rapporteur , Mr Imbeni , has done an excellent job .
There is no need to repeat anything .
I should like to expand on two problematic issues .
The first is a question of principle .
Its increasing politicisation in recent years is an unacceptable and , ultimately , also inhumane phenomenon .
The second problem is directly linked to the first and yet is of a very practical nature .
It should be noted here that the regional approach adopted by the existing DIPECHO instrument offers a possible solution .
I believe that there is a considerable need for action here in the future .
It is true that there has been a lot of criticism of humanitarian aid .
Nevertheless and with a view to the future , we must take some steps forward .
We have seen this in the case of Mozambique and other disasters .
Secondly , it is urgent that we increase the number of staff dedicated to humanitarian aid activities .
The number of ECHO ' s staff is not proportional to the importance of its work .
In this respect , we wish to highlight the importance of DIPECHO .
What could be more important than humanitarian emergency aid ?
Needless to say , the European Union has its work cut out in this respect .
ECHO must become the central coordination platform for all Member States .
Moreover , increased transparency would create an additional incentive to meet the highest demands .
A number of speakers have already said as much this evening .
Only then will Europe be able to make a virtue of need .
Mr President , throughout the world , development aid is giving way to humanitarian aid .
Instead of this , the European Union always reacts too late - once the disaster has been declared .
The connection between humanitarian and development policy , although crucial , is systematically missing .
We hope that cross-sector posts will be created in order to link ECHO and the Directorate-General for Development .
Payments must also be made more rapidly .
Venezuela has been waiting since last December for the aid it was promised .
I want to refer to the question of Third World debt relief .
Debt service payments often exceed health and education budgets .
Surely there is nothing more important in developing countries than education .
If people have literacy and numeracy they are a danger to the leadership of the worst-governed countries .
The effect of the Aids pandemic means that progress and development become more difficult .
We must address this problem urgently .
The Ugandan President has set up a massive programme to deal with the Aids pandemic in his own country .
It is a great example for the rest of the African countries .
This is a barbaric and hypocritical position .
EU leaders should have the courage to face up to the key defence manufacturers .
You may be certain , Commissioner Patten , that this report is of the greatest importance to Parliament .
Many congratulations to the honourable Member .
I am the first to acknowledge that we have a great deal to do to improve our performance .
We very much appreciate Parliament 's support for the reforms we are seeking .
Both Commissioner Nielson and I want to help countries and peoples in emergencies .
That is not , and never has been , where ECHO 's strengths lie .
Mr Imbeni mentioned the important issue of visibility .
That is important .
That is our clear and ambitious goal .
I should like to end with just one reflection .
I do not come entirely new to the debate on these issues .
The honourable Member 's report will make a significant contribution to that .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Patten .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow , at 12.30 p.m.
( The sitting was closed at 9.15 p.m. )
In all sincerity , I can do no more than offer you our deepest sympathy .
To you , Elvira , María José , we can only offer our deepest sympathy .
I understand very well what a great job all councillors do .
That is how Martín Carpena won the affection of all the people of Malaga .
It is important , however , that they continue to have value .
The front line of democracy must be defended democratically .
There can be no greater contradiction .
This will commit us in the future to the fight for democracy and freedom .
Please be assured that the sacrifice of Martín Carpena has not been in vain .
We invite all those who seek peaceful change to gather around the negotiating table .
The Middle East
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the Middle East .
This rapid series of developments mainly concerns negotiations between Israel and Palestine .
Several hundred prisoners have been released , although the overall outcome is still not completely satisfactory .
Other provisions have not been properly implemented .
For example , the third redeployment has not taken place .
On the contrary , it created new momentum .
Peace in the Middle East may be in sight , but that does not make it a fait accompli .
Camp David opened up new possibilities .
We therefore have an historic opportunity and the current situation is still extremely auspicious .
This exceptional opportunity must not be wasted .
You also noticed how just how strong expectations of Europe still were .
But , as you know , it does not stipulate that this is a condition .
Its position on this question is as stated in the Berlin declaration of March 1999 .
An Israeli-Palestinian agreement is indispensable .
It is vital but it alone cannot guarantee peace and stability in the Middle East .
In this respect , there are prospects despite the contrasts in the present situation .
We really must highlight the sense of responsibility which both sides demonstrated here .
The situation along the border with Israel is , however , still volatile .
Incidents flare up along the blue line blue from time to time but have been relatively minor so far .
It is therefore in the interest of all the parties to avoid any incident which might provoke an escalation .
Although still inadequate , regional integration is progressing slowly but surely .
Negotiations are under way with both Lebanon and Syria .
Naturally I very much agree with what the President-in-office has just said .
Camp David helped to narrow the gaps between the parties to the dispute .
With time moving relentlessly on , there has inevitably been a growing amount of talk about Palestinian statehood .
The Berlin European Council Declaration remains the position of the European Union .
That is our position .
As far as Syria is concerned , everyone recognises that President Bashar al-Assad needs to consolidate his position .
We will continue to do all we can to achieve this .
It is important to remember what the scale of that assistance is .
I hope that the document and its implementation will help to consolidate political developments in the region .
We stand ready to help them in every way we can , politically and economically .
The differences between the parties , however , have probably never been so profound .
What we can we in the European Union do ?
It is a process taking place between peoples and between parliaments , which democratically represent those peoples .
I believe that this is the fundamental message we can offer you .
We are approaching a deadline .
We welcome the efforts of President Clinton and Secretary of State Albright .
Those are the very important and thorny issues which must be dealt with .
It is not only a political problem . It is a cultural , historical and religious problem .
Therefore , there is no room for a solution based on exclusive claims .
We all very much regret that the Camp David negotiations came to nothing .
Indeed , we now have to ensure that the negotiations are resumed as quickly as possible .
The EU owes this much to both parties and to the international community .
We cannot tolerate violence in any form .
What , then , do these decisions imply ?
Israel is opposed to this .
The Palestinians are prepared to compromise .
They are not demanding west Jerusalem .
They appreciate that Israel cannot receive between five and six million Palestinian refugees .
The Palestinians are prepared to make concessions over territory .
Israel has the military power and US backing .
The Palestinians do in fact have international law on their side .
This would also raise the EU ' s standing in the world .
It also suggested that high-ranking Israeli and Palestinian leaders be invited jointly to the European Parliament .
I tend to agree with what the President-in-Office said on the subject .
On the contrary .
This sort of reminder would not in any way close the door to the compromises needed .
The United States alone cannot provide this guarantee .
No one today knows the intentions of the future leaders of the Israelis and the Palestinians .
Madam President , thank you very much indeed for arranging this very important debate at this particular time .
However , I do not believe that these peace talks were a complete failure either .
I very much hope that the Middle East will resume peace talks in the near future .
Permanent status negotiations resumed in September 1999 .
I believe that the best way to address this latter issue is through negotiation .
In the overall context , securing peace in the Middle East is always going to take time .
In any case , the extreme time pressure which the participants were under did not serve any immediate purpose .
In popular speech , Arafat has inherited this dubious Arab title of honour from Saddam Hussein .
He put his bleak state of mind into words this summer in a probing newspaper article .
He would kill them en masse and throw them into the sea .
I can see Arafat in his grey-green military outfit .
An Arafat , dressed as Che Guevara and greeted as a Saladin : it breaks my heart " .
This is a view which will hopefully give Western politicians food for thought .
In the foregoing , my aim was certainly not to trivialise the suffering of the Palestinian people .
I wish them a life in peace and freedom with all my heart .
Madam President , Europe has a special historical responsibility for the peace process in the Middle East .
There are precedents for this .
I see it rather as yet one more chance for peace in the Middle East .
Discussions have certainly never progressed this far before .
The gulf is still wide , although certain historical taboos have been broken .
But that is not enough .
This is the price for peace .
To rely on the strength of symbols , on either side , is to hold on to a myth .
For the Israelis , before Camp David , no part of Jerusalem could be touched .
Now the taboo has been broken .
Since 1993 , Jerusalem has been a closed city for the Palestinians .
For the Palestinians , the divided territories are a nightmare .
Their imprisonment is a constant threat to the peace process .
And I , together with the thousand Italians , saw these settlements expanding all over the place .
Peace is necessary .
I fully endorse the statements by the President-in-Office and Commissioner Patten .
It is a lesson to the Middle East that it is unwise to nationalise the oil industry .
Jerusalem is the key issue and it needs to be looked at in a new light .
It is a unique problem which requires a unique response .
To conclude , we know full well that peace is always a difficult process .
Europe , torn apart over the centuries , knows that better than most .
It has been proposed that it become the capital of both States .
That would be ideal .
I would like to end with a reference to what is known as the International Statute of Jerusalem .
Having said which , every historic opportunity has its historic risk .
Equally clearly , time is running out .
What role , therefore , can the European Union play ?
What does this role involve ?
We can always wish for a more active Europe .
I too wish for a more active Europe .
The French Presidency has vowed to have a highly active Europe .
At the same time , however , you cannot rewrite history .
Nor can you act against the wishes of the players themselves .
So find ourselves between these two sides .
What does this role involve ?
It is exercised at three levels , as I have said .
The European Union intervenes in support of the negotiations .
It is in contact with both sides , through our intermediary , Mr Moratinos .
It constantly encourages negotiation .
Secondly , the European Union makes a contribution to the debate on issues connected with the negotiations .
What can the European Union do in this context ?
There is all the action which Commissioner Patten summarised .
I heard a call for a summit meeting here .
What we are planning at the moment is a ministerial-level meeting .
That concludes the debate .
EU external action priorities
I should like to explain briefly the four main objectives which we have set ourselves .
The French Presidency ' s first objective is to give new momentum to the accession negotiations .
Hence the main deadlines during our presidency will be as follows :
As you will see , we hope to give a strong new impetus to the enlargement process .
We are waiting with interest for the House to adopt Mr Morillon ' s reports on these important issues .
The Union now has the instruments which it needs in order to apply a common foreign policy .
All these dimensions apply .
The Council reiterated in July that only a political solution would bring about a lasting settlement of this conflict .
I am thinking here of Asia .
History will record two important summits with key countries in the region during the French Presidency .
The other summit , with China , will be held in Beijing on 23 October .
France has also suggested that its partners consider the future of relations with Cuba .
Finally , its financial resources , our financial resources , are considerable .
Several items were entered on the agenda .
I am thinking here about political dialogue , financial cooperation and commercial franchises .
Any such discussion should of course begin with the Treaty .
That objective reflects a number of things .
The Euro would also come under this heading .
It reflects our responsibilities for external assistance which have grown exponentially in recent years .
A more stable neighbourhood and a more stable world guarantee a more stable European Union .
We have a real contribution to make and we must not be afraid to make it .
I have every sympathy for European Parliament 's desire to do exactly the same .
What does that mean in practice for the Commission ?
I think we are starting to improve things .
I chair the group of RELEX Commissioners which meets regularly both formally and informally .
It was evident at Evian with ministers this weekend .
That is important in the Council and it is important in the Parliament because you are the budgetary authority .
But are we really well-equipped to do justice to these challenges ?
Are the structures genuinely suitable ?
All this is bound to lead to a situation that will be untenable in the long run .
Kosovo is a case in point : it was absolute chaos .
That is the real problem and it is increasingly bringing us into disrepute .
We have had our first taste of this only a year on .
Only , we must have the good sense to bring about a certain amount of coordination between them .
I believe we will find the right moment to make a start on this .
We shall now suspend the sitting .
Normally I would regard this as a private matter and not my concern .
I can make this programme available to you .
This puts the whole visit in an entirely different context .
I understand what you are saying , Mrs Read , and the presidency takes note of your comment .
We shall correct this mistake and keep you informed of the situation .
Mr Goodwill , I believe that what you wish to say echoes Mrs Read ' s comments .
We were merely visiting the United States as a group organised from within our own national groups .
We all know what the problem is .
Let us proceed to the vote .
( Parliament approved the resolution )
Galeote Quecedo ( PPE-DE ) .
I am extremely grateful for the courteous offer that has been made .
Last night we had the opportunity to discuss this extremely important report at some length .
It is a very good report on an important subject .
We hope that it will be a beacon for all of us in the dark nights that lie ahead .
( Laughter and applause )
( Parliament approved the legislative resolution )
Explanations of vote
Dell ' Alba report ( A5-0202 / 2000 )
Piétrasanta report ( A5-0205 / 2000 )
What are you doing to help us ? "
Galeote Quecedo report ( A5-0210 / 2000 )
We also support the initiative to give further training to EC officials engaged in external activities .
We are opposed , however , to setting up a college of diplomacy for training the staff .
That would create an unclear picture of which problems are to be solved by the national embassies .
We have abstained from voting because the aims of the report are unclear .
The subtle internal balances of the PPE probably explain the baroque nature of the structure being proposed to us .
But now we have the key and know how to decipher .
What are we creating with this new institution ?
In this particular case , what foreign policy will this Community diplomatic corps serve ?
What common interests is it supposed to defend ?
This is a typically Marxist approach .
The common instrument is supposed to produce the common conscience , the common will , the common responsibility .
I cannot therefore vote in favour of Mr Galeote Quecedo ' s report .
Imbeni report ( A5-0191 / 2000 )
I wish to start by congratulating Mr Imbeni on the quality of his report .
Today , half the world lives on less than two dollars a day .
This is unacceptable !
Has the money released been squandered ?
I do not think so .
Nonetheless , humanitarian aid needs to be rationalised .
I utterly repudiate this .
Mrs Raschhofer , I shall gladly pass your comments on to President Fontaine .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.23 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m. )
Vice-President , thank you for giving me the floor .
I will re-read the point that I wanted to make .
This of course puts the visit in an entirely different context .
An official delegation from Parliament , which I headed , visited the United States of America in June .
I will of course pass on the other documentation that I have received .
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Actually there is no mention of what I said .
The right to exist as Basque .
You can understand that the difference is a very substantial one .
I would like to amend it .
That is my protest .
I would like to amend what is in the verbatim report .
To say in the Minutes that I spoke is not sufficient .
You must record the sense of what I said yesterday .
This too will be included in the Verbatim Report .
We will of course examine how this has happened . I am taking note of this now .
( The Minutes were approved )
Are there any objections to this ?
I would urge you to arrange this accordingly .
Mr Poettering , Parliament is sovereign .
Are there any objections ?
Then the decision is as stated .
EU external action priorities ( continuation )
Mr President , many thanks for allowing me to continue this morning ' s debate .
It encompasses development cooperation and naturally the traditional tools of foreign policy .
It is unfortunate that Mr Solana was unable to be here to make a contribution of this kind .
It is clear that a successful foreign policy cannot stand on one pillar alone .
A second general point I should like to refer to is in respect of the efficiency of policy .
That clearly is a farce in anyone 's analysis .
This is an accumulation of an ineffective and inefficient system over years .
We welcome the commitment to an urgent review of that process .
Blanket secrecy is not the way to legitimise an evolving Community policy .
It amounts to a form of intergovernmental conspiracy against citizens ' right to know .
The Commission must have a strong role to play in this process .
I therefore feel that the question should perhaps be broached with greater flexibility .
In politics , we never use the word " never " .
I should like quickly to ask the President-in-Office two questions .
I was interested to read of a recent Franco-German initiative to unite consulates .
My second question is this .
Firstly , to guarantee more effective , coherent and visible external action on the part of the European Union .
In the United States there is currently a great debate taking place concerning defence expenditure .
This Parliament would clearly have preferred the figure of the High Representative to be answerable to the Commission .
That implies firm and unswerving commitment from the Council itself first of all .
You spoke of high ambition , Minister , and I was pleased to hear it .
But that also presupposes a Commission genuinely capable of action .
But in this short speech , I want to focus on enlargement .
A recent interview with a German newspaper stirred up some turmoil .
A slapdash enlargement would obviously be a great mistake .
I believe the speech you gave in Paris was significant in this respect .
The European Parliament will play an important part in this .
After all , we know that we must take a considerably broader view of the issue of protection .
We will revisit this theme at a later stage .
The lion ' s share of aid - two-thirds in fact - originates from our European Union .
Needless to say , this identity can only find expression in true European policy .
European responsibilities can certainly not be divided among fifteen to thirty or perhaps more Member States .
This is about a practical solution : how can we solve the problems we have encountered ?
That is what this is all about !
We need to ask ourselves how we can prevent this .
This is when we say as a Parliament : we need European policy ; otherwise we will not succeed .
The priorities established deserve all our support .
Time permits only a couple of remarks on my part .
I know , Commissioner Patten , that this is the direction your politics are taking right now .
I would just emphasise that it is a matter of urgency .
We therefore now need to discuss the different issues .
In what form will the European Union be present and at what level ?
The Member States need to take these factors on board .
I think I can announce the body of the conclusions today .
If so , I can support this .
This concept I wholeheartedly reject .
They have never been asked in honest terms .
But this is only half the problem .
But how much real responsibility will they have ?
I would also like to thank Commissioner Patten for being here .
I would also like to highlight the excellent climate in which this budgetary procedure has opened .
This year , the provisions of the new interinstitutional agreement of 6 May 1999 have taken full effect .
The situation is sensitive , but not chaotic .
There is work to be done , and work is being done .
The EUR 614 million adopted by the Council will ensure funding of all foreseeable needs .
The Council has also ensured the funding of all the European Union ' s other policy priorities .
In fact , there is under-implementation of these appropriations every year .
The EUR 614 million adopted by the Council will be enough to finance all the foreseeable needs .
We look forward to reading the report with interest , not to say impatience .
I wish to conclude this overview of the various categories of expenditure with the expenditure on pre-accession aid .
For these the Council has kept the Commission ' s figure for commitment appropriations .
Accordingly , I am bound to contradict the assessment of the President-in-Office .
Indeed , all the appropriations for Kosovo have in fact been tied up already .
Part of this could perhaps be made additionally available before the end of this year .
I hope to enlist your support in this matter .
The Commission believes this to be unacceptable .
Our findings are now available to you .
The Commission has estimated that we need 1254 new posts for key activities and political priorities .
Many thanks , Commissioner .
We will certainly need energy and patience .
I will start with the European Court of Justice .
I believe this is a contradiction-in-terms which has still to be resolved .
As rapporteur , I will duly prepare proposals to this end .
However , we must tackle this over the next few years .
This is another issue that the Council failed to take into account at first reading .
Turning now to the European Court of Auditors .
I shall now move on to the Economic and Social Committee .
Needless to say , the same holds true for the Economic and Social Committee .
The ECSC ' s working method and public image are extremely dubious .
Hence my proposals are geared towards raising the productivity of the Economic and Social Committee .
In particular , the promotion policy of the Economic and Social Committee requires careful scrutiny .
We should also reflect on the role of the Secretariat of the Economic and Social Committee .
The ECSC currently derives all its expertise from outside experts .
However , I ask myself whether that should be the aim of such an institution ' s work .
That is something else we need to discuss .
The same applies to the Committee of the Regions .
I am only able to mention one interesting aspect .
We have placed part of this money for the financial year 2000 in reserve .
To date , there has been no application for us to release these funds .
I only have a very brief comment to make in respect of the Ombudsman .
There is not a great deal to add here .
The Council has grasped the nettle and we support them in this .
I will not submit any further proposals on this matter .
It is imperative that we take the same line for the administrative budget .
There are major tasks in store for us over the next few years .
But as you are all yourselves aware , repetition is the only way to learn .
So far , so good .
So what exactly are the problematic areas ?
Where do Parliament and the Council differ ?
In view of the limited amount of time available to us all , allow me to mention just two .
The Council flatly refuses to countenance such a revision of the Financial Perspective .
It obviously prefers a hand-to-mouth existence .
No revision !
That is the name of the game .
After all , that is where they belong logically , and in terms of content .
As a Parliament , we now have an extremely difficult decision before us with respect to Category 4 .
The Commissioner made the same point .
In quite a few lines , no payments whatsoever have been earmarked for the commitments for 2001 .
This no longer has a great deal to do with serious budgetary management .
In fact it means that a strict relationship should be preserved between commitment appropriations and payment appropriations .
The Council is neglecting this close relationship in the most criminal way .
Its aim is to reduce expenditure .
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on Aids .
The most tragic consequences are in Africa .
The African continent finally had the professionals and experts it so lacked at the time of independence .
Now the disease has taken a heavy toll among those trained adults of working age .
His testimony illustrates African injustice .
So the issue of HIV-AIDS lies at the very heart of sustainable development .
Aids decimates societies , threatens future generations and compromises economic growth .
Beyond Africa , the pandemic is global .
Thirty-five million people live with the virus , but fewer than 500 000 have access to antiretroviral treatments .
Today everyone knows these treatments exist .
New programmes are now being launched in Senegal , Vietnam and South Africa .
So the international context is evolving .
The United Nations , its agencies and the World Bank are mobilising to strengthen international therapeutic solidarity .
It means the price of medication used to treat Aids can be reduced .
Such initiatives show that the mobilisation of the international community is strengthening , and it must not slacken .
New commitment is necessary .
We are convinced of that .
International aid must be strengthened urgently in the fight against HIV-AIDS .
Several initiatives have been launched .
A Japanese conference will also be held in the context of the G8 this autumn on these three diseases .
Consideration of access to treatment is not new .
The road is hard , but it must be travelled .
We know now that the epidemic can only be overcome through long-term commitment .
Possibilities will be further discussed with the countries involved .
The statistics of the epidemic are frightening and still getting worse .
These opportunities must be exploited immediately , and the Commission intends to play its part .
We are therefore focusing more and more on this field .
This is in clear contrast to the recent offer from the United States to southern Africa .
How different is the situation in many Third World countries , especially in Africa !
There the tragedy has now exceeded everyone ' s expectations .
And this is only the humanitarian tragedy .
Then there is the socio-economic tragedy .
I believe it is not helpful to try to copy European policy in Africa .
The situation in many African countries does not lend itself to European solutions .
There really is a feeling that people are finally beginning to ask the right questions .
Now perhaps the right answers should be provided .
I am thinking , in particular , of the debates on industrial property rights and compulsory licences .
Rather , I am going to try to talk about facts .
I think the facts , today , are simple .
The facts are access to treatment and patient care .
I think the agony of a whole continent takes precedence over special interests .
Prevention cannot succeed unless it is accompanied by access to treatment .
We would not be having this debate if triple therapy cost a dollar .
Besides , medication cannot be distributed like sacks of rice .
Doctors , dispensaries and social support structures are needed .
Finally , the research priority must be to perfect a vaccine .
Madam President , I am speaking on behalf of the Members of the Bonino List .
As we know , there is an old saying , prevention is better than cure .
Money is not enough , however .
This applies not only to HIV but also to malaria .
We need to be guided by innovative thinking in this area .
We talk a very great deal about Africa .
The time for thinking really is over .
We have no right to disappoint that hope and I will be at your side .
We will meet the challenge together .
. I just want to thank you for these contributions .
We are aware of the enormous challenge facing us .
Prevention works , but it takes time .
Uganda is a good illustration of this .
We have to be able to continue and to support the right strategies .
Mr Mantovani said that we should forgive debt and use the money instead to combat Aids .
When we forgive debt , we have used the money .
You are suggesting that we use it twice .
That is a good innovative approach , but still not that easy .
We are supporting this .
We are trying to crack the code of protective rights for the companies but it is not easy .
I want to thank the President and the Commissioner for their understanding .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at12 noon .
Creating a monitoring centre for industrial change
There remains the question of how this monitoring function should be organised .
For logistics it could rely on the existing European institutions .
France will do everything possible to ensure that it can be in place before the end of this presidency .
Thank you , Madam President .
In its report the high level group recommended the creation of an observatory .
This report has been endorsed by the Council .
We have already discussed it three times in Parliament .
This mechanism could also serve as a forum on change .
What is the role of this mechanism ?
Of course we shall take their opinion into account before our final proposal .
I would like to make several points about this issue of an observatory or monitoring centre .
The Dublin Institute has been mentioned already .
Nor , in my view , should they try to do that .
Let the economy and market forces get on with it .
I am surprised because that emphasis denotes unawareness of this particular form of change .
In short , we should not try to reinvent the wheel .
Perhaps you could pop back periodically .
First , we are not calling for the creation of a new expensive agency or institute .
Second , we are not seeking to stop mergers , transfers , restructuring or globalisation itself .
This is not an idea we have plucked out of the air .
That is not the case at all .
Your resolution is factually incorrect .
But perhaps I am a hopeless optimist .
I greatly regret the situation , just as you do , because I am inheriting the problem .
The fact of the matter is , however , that I can only guarantee us one hour here .
This is in the interests of our citizens as well as industry .
Do not pick the winners and let the winners pick .
That was also the conclusion at the Lisbon Summit .
I was really taken aback by this .
And there was I thinking we were dealing with reliable partners .
The spectre of the repairable society is on the loose once again in Europe .
Europe and the European economy are doing well .
A new Monitoring Centre is no antidote to this .
The same arguments crop up time and again .
I do hope this time is the last time .
We need to take a more consistent line .
This too seems to us to be essential for the purposes of managing industrial change .
We are not going to oppose the creation of a monitoring centre for industrial change .
And it is always the workers who have to pay the price , never the shareholders .
This is in response to the comments made by Mr Hughes .
I believe that the Council has indeed introduced new elements today .
Judging from the discussion , the Council has made some progress .
This would be the best way forward .
Secondly , it is true that we need to avoid excessive bureaucracy .
This is a key point .
However , I was also reminded of what happened to the Titanic .
It sank because there was no observation system for icebergs in those days .
Needless to say , after the sinking of the Titanic , such a system was introduced without delay .
That is not a quotation from some irresponsible or lunatic left-winger .
There are the national governments and research institutes .
We do not want to be mere spectators of the progress of industrial and social change .
A year later , as a first concrete step , we are offered a monitoring centre for industrial change .
Fine , but let it really serve the cause of the employees .
Minister , it is a great pleasure to see you here again .
She clearly thinks that change is a bad thing .
If we want to survive and prosper in the 21st century then we must welcome and manage change .
We must not monitor and prevent it .
So I was deeply disheartened to hear of this proposal for an observatory .
The rule seems to be : another day , another quango .
And all for what ?
To produce fat reports which will be translated into 11 languages but which nobody will read .
Then we stand back proud and happy that we have solved the problem .
But we have not solved the problem .
I put two questions to colleagues .
First , do we need this observatory at all ?
I think not .
I am sure it would .
. ( FR ) Ladies and gentlemen , just two sentences .
I have listened carefully to the debate which has taken place in this Chamber .
I find that approach interesting .
Mr President , I shall be brief because I know time is short .
It was a very interesting debate and there were two dimensions .
The first is the political one and the second is the technical one .
The new economy is not a natural phenomenon , it is a political phenomenon .
This is why we are not proposing a new institution or a new structure .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon .
Question Time ( Council )
The next item is Question Time ( B5-0535 / 2000 ) . We will examine questions to the Council .
You know that we have very little time .
Since they deal with the same subject , Question Nos 1 and 2 will be taken together .
Question No 2 by ( H-643 / 00 ) :
Our representatives have been urging the United States to ratify it in bilateral contacts .
The European Union has started actively preparing for the event .
Question No 3 by ( H-0627 / 00 ) :
How does the Council envisage strengthening the role of labour and management ?
How will it monitor their involvement more effectively ?
The Council has always regarded social dialogue as enormously important .
That is an important priority for the French Presidency .
Europe must not and cannot interfere in everything .
At the same time , the involvement of both sides of industry must be continually intensified .
Mr President , the social partnership should be a forward-looking partnership .
The Council does not have any response to this question at this stage .
Question No 4 by ( H-0697 / 00 ) :
Mr Ford , I have my own personal opinion on the matter .
I imagine that you know something of my views as a member of the French Government .
They are known to Austria at least .
That , in any case , was the mandate given them .
I have listened to the French Presidency ' s answer with a great deal of interest .
We were by no means the last to demand the bilateral measures which were taken .
Question No 5 by ( H-0597 / 00 ) :
Let me do a little advertising by announcing that the 1999-2000 edition is now available .
I was basing my answer on the facts available to me , i.e. the statistics .
I am not willing to make a qualitative judgement which might not be justified .
I can give you this summary table if you wish , Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines .
And if so , when ?
This is what we wish to do for the European Union .
It is not an easy task .
The fact is , however , that we still have a few years to consider the matter .
Question No 6 by ( H-0605 / 00 ) :
What are the scope and substance of the mandate ?
It is strictly limited to agriculture .
The negotiations which are due to open must therefore make it possible to strengthen this Euro-Mediterranean partnership .
At the request of the Member States , the measures which may give rise to concessions are strictly delimited .
I believe that this is exactly the philosophy which will be guiding our negotiations .
I can therefore only endorse what is more a compliment than a question .
Question No 7 by ( H-0610 / 00 ) :
The Council awaits Parliament ' s opinion with interest .
The Commission will present its proposal on the implementation of a single financial framework at a later date .
I should therefore like to repeat and specify and update my question .
What is the Council ' s reply to Mr Gem ?
I do not have a specific answer on this issue .
That is the general rule .
That is the basis on which we conducted our negotiations .
( The President cut the speaker off )
At the same time , we must greet its efforts positively .
Question No 8 by ( H-0614 / 00 ) :
The United States Government has more than doubled the level of subsidies per farmer .
This is a crucial issue of democracy .
In a democracy , decisions are agreed by the majority not by unanimity .
It does not operate in a vacuum .
The Council as such is not , by definition , a member of the Intergovernmental Conference .
Question No 10 by ( H-0617 / 00 ) :
I understand the concerns behind the honourable Member ' s question .
I feel , however , the question itself contained observations of quite a different kind .
It is a fact that the whole of the Mediterranean area is frightened about this .
This is not a subject that I am prepared to make impromptu comments on .
Question No 11 by ( H-0619 / 00 ) :
The police who arrived on the scene failed to make any arrests .
This is not the first attack against the Greek minority .
The action programme is basically devoted to matters relating to problems of migration and asylum .
The European Union is , moreover , already active in these fields .
I should like to thank the Council representative for his reply .
I should like answers to these questions , minister .
This is a general problem which must be dealt with as such .
An interim report is expected for the European Council in Nice in December .
Question No 12 by ( H-0622 / 00 ) :
At the Feira European Council it was decided to relax sanctions .
The relevant management committee is scheduled to examine these proposals on 17 October this year .
I would thank the President of the Council for that answer .
Examination of the situation in Chechnya will thus clearly be part of the assessment process .
Question No 13 by ( H-0624 / 00 ) :
Does it plan to make any arrangements to compensate for the unfair and deliberate damage caused ?
The principle of the freedom to pursue a trade is firmly upheld in the European Union .
Do you not think this might have harmful repercussions for the internal market in fur goods ?
I am answering on behalf of the Council and not on behalf of the French Government .
I am not going to respond ad hoc to a question on such a difficult subject .
Question No 14 by ( H-0625 / 00 ) :
The logical consequence of this aim should , therefore , be to make Council proceedings more open .
The public debates are , moreover , an established practice .
Moreover , Rule 8 of the Council 's Rules of Procedure provides for the organisation of public debates .
Over 3000 detailed reports of the public debates have been delivered by post .
Furthermore , any interested parties will easily be able to access the Internet networks which deal with this subject .
I want to thank the Council for its detailed answer .
I am fortunate enough to be a member of the cabinet in the government of my country .
This is the situation we have , if we take the hybrid nature of the Council into due account .
Thank you very much , Mr Moscovici , for showing such dedication to Parliament this afternoon .
That concludes Question to the Council .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.15 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. ) .
Economic and social development of Turkey
This could seem ridiculous , but it is not at all .
I shall come back to these contrasting reactions in detail when I present my report .
Today , I shall simply come to the main conclusion .
There is a Kurdish problem in Turkey .
The Council must not forbid the European Parliament to propose its contribution to the solution .
We are keen to use this instrument to promote economic and social development in Turkey .
And what does the government do as one of its first acts ?
The issue in question is one which has to be settled on a legal basis .
Is there really a problem here ?
Then it is one for Parliament to deal with .
The Kurdish problem has already been mentioned .
In that area too , scarcely any progress has been made .
Again and again , we see first positive , then negative signs .
Those who know that this is a crucial problem lack the courage to do anything about it .
You mentioned the Corsican problem .
Of course , there are also other problems involving minorities .
The death penalty was mentioned .
He is very familiar with the situation in Turkey .
He is aware of the problems of this country and of the people who live there .
At the very end of the day , Turkey will benefit from these reforms being put into practice .
Allow me to give you some facts and figures .
And , I would add , Mr Gem says the same about Greek-Turkish relations .
I do not therefore intend to repeat arguments which I accept overall .
However , I should like to make a few comments .
Take a look at Turkey . It is a law unto itself .
It radiates crisis on every side .
It is because of its political system that Turkey radiates these crises .
And I think that the main issue is precisely this process and this road .
From this viewpoint , the Morillon proposal is an encouraging prospect .
I am glad that we have been able to achieve far-reaching agreement .
The report now proposes adding three points to the draft regulation .
I am able to tell you that the Commission shares Parliament ' s view on these points .
All these financial resources are designed to support implementation of the pre-accession strategy .
The purpose of the strategy is to equip Turkey for entering into negotiations .
I welcome Turkey ' s signature of these documents as an important step in the right direction .
I also expressly insisted upon this in the course of the discussions in Turkey .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Community audiovisual policy in the digital age
Changes in technology bring changing perspectives and therefore changes in legal approaches as well .
Mr President , first of all , I should like to thank Mr Veltroni .
The audiovisual sector basically faces the task of having to develop in two main fields .
It is therefore important always to keep both perspectives in view .
I should like briefly to illustrate this by way of three examples .
Firstly , it is necessary to regulate content and methods of transmission differently and independently of each other .
We need a form of technology which can respond very quickly and very flexibly to the technological revolution .
I would just mention the buzz word ' Internet ' at this point .
Secondly , consider the level at which decisions are made .
Thirdly , television in Europe .
Thank you very much to Mr Veltroni for giving us such a valuable report .
Mr President , Commissioner , the airwaves are buzzing .
This would not be possible , and nor would it be desirable .
They have the right and the responsibility to decide for themselves what is suitable for their children .
So we do not need complex censorship and filtering systems in programmes .
It is often very doubtful as to where the boundary lies .
My group will vote accordingly .
I am not calling for quotas .
I believe this presents a unique opportunity for the European Investment Bank .
I am very interested by this definition , which naturally complements today 's discussion .
The aim of defining European audiovisual works must therefore be to achieve the circulation of these works .
The issue of the work ' s content concerns us all .
What content can define a work , if it is not content founded on a pluralist approach to production ?
I would like to end by emphasising the essential points of this report .
What could protect diversity and pluralism better than a " universal service " ?
What would ensure free access to information , entertainment and knowledge ?
Public television is not a monopoly and should not be one .
However , I would like to touch on a few points .
Moving on to some specific points of the report under consideration .
But what does this mean ?
Perhaps Mr Veltroni could enlighten us .
In my view , this would be a serious error .
Remember the Napster and the New Tell cases .
With regard to cinema , additional funding is requested for European cinema .
Public television networks must be privatised or increasingly high licence fees will be imposed for new investments .
To fail to act would be like an ostrich burying its head in the sand .
I am sure that that is not what we want .
First is the definition of public service .
In this respect we are behaving like the aforementioned ostrich .
Lastly , there is the implication of the laws on competition and mergers .
The audiovisual policy should tackle these points and also go into more depth in the field of competition .
The move into the digital age is a massive revolution for the media .
It cannot be a matter of equipment or financial gain .
The importance of the equality of information must not be underrated .
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are talking about the " Television without Frontiers " Directive .
It will not be possible to watch the BBC in the Irish Republic .
It may no longer be possible to watch Swedish television as easily in Finland .
It has in the past been possible to watch television across national borders .
It is difficult to buy digital cards for existing pay TV .
I would therefore urge the Commissioner to bear this in mind .
Not all languages are in fact equal in the EU in this respect .
In the view of the Communist Party of Greece , they should be controlled by the public sector .
The real problem is that the people need to develop their resistance and enforce their right to fundamental information .
We have to make use of it and create the relevant statutory framework .
I should like to add to what the previous speakers have said by expanding briefly upon a few points .
Not everything needs to be over-regulated by the legislator .
Thirdly , audiovisual policy concerns infrastructure and content .
Only those who provide exciting content for a large number of viewers are taken notice of .
Fourthly , the approach according to which content and infrastructure are closely regulated should be maintained .
We need to keep pace and ought not to lose any more time .
Secondly , cultural and linguistic diversity is a fundamental objective of Community policy in the audiovisual sector .
A good way of favouring diversity is to give particular support to the weaker elements .
Mr Veltroni 's report makes important proposals in this area .
However , not everything can be regulated by law .
The transfer of media-related skills must become a component of the Community ' s audiovisual strategy .
To that extent , the Commission ' s communication still does not go far enough .
In particular , the Commission welcomes Parliament 's support on the regulatory principle described in the communication .
They will all decide together , however , whether or not a revision is necessary .
I think that one day we will have to discuss in depth what this advantage may also imply .
All of this changes the issue of pluralism , however , and makes it more complex .
The obstacles to pluralism in the digital world include poverty and a lack of education and training .
The issue of the digital divide has been raised .
That is something we do not teach our little darlings .
I would also like to warmly welcome the quasi-unanimity on the MEDIA programme .
The European industry must be able to make the most of these opportunities .
Progress has already been made , however , in the past ten years .
A change has therefore already taken place .
This is the great danger that will affect the final decision on this project .
The MEDIA plus programme invests in promotion , distribution and digital training .
The Commission communication will also consider State aid to cinematographic production , an issue that concerns us all .
One of today ' s speakers has already referred to this .
The Commission does not intervene in this area and the text on transparency is clear on this point .
The concept of universal service is mentioned in the report .
The Commission has clarified its position many times .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Socio-economic background of Erasmus students
I should like to thank all the interpreters for staying behind .
It seems to achieve some of the results that it actually expects .
This survey is a fascinating one , carried out in 1998 .
There are a number of interesting facts and figures .
But there are a few that I have a great deal of interest in .
Ninety-one percent were over the moon with what had happened to them on the course .
Fortunately two or three Members ( and the Commission as well ) did read them .
A number noticed little points that I had to then retract .
So I really wanted to keep that in my report .
I look forward to my new Labour colleagues voting on this particular matter .
I believe it is slightly too late to ask for a split vote .
I have also tabled a couple of amendments .
So I have tabled an amendment which would delete that .
I commend it to the House .
I think , though , that , as you yourself have already said , quality speaks for itself .
You have briefly commented upon your report and your amendments yourself .
Unfortunately , a figure of only 1 % was achieved in the first year .
The participation rate has risen and is now just under 50 % of the figure aimed at .
Fifty-seven percent of Erasmus students had considerable difficulties financing their stay abroad .
Above all , it is a question of preserving equality of opportunity in all countries .
That is why it is worth showing some commitment .
I think that making equal opportunities available to young people is quite important for us all .
Admittedly , there are problems .
Therefore , it is untrue that only children from privileged backgrounds can benefit from Erasmus grants .
What conclusions can we draw from this ?
I will give you an example at random .
As you can see , there are good ideas , all sorts of good ideas .
A greater number of happy Erasmus students is in the interests of our society as a whole .
So let us all work together so that there will be a large number of them in future .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
The next item is the joint discussion of the following reports :
[ COM ( 2000 ) 304 - C5-0315 / 2000 - 2000 / 0154 ( CNS ) ]
The Commission and the rapporteur have done some good work .
However , the effects of fisheries agreements upon the EU budget are not something to be sneezed at .
Allow me to explain what I mean .
We are concerned here with mixed agreements .
Fisheries is the ideal field for such a combination .
Obviously , that would have to be compatible with the common European fisheries policy .
Both agreements have been renewed regularly .
I am referring in particular to the agreement with Morocco .
Everybody must do their duty and fulfil their obligations .
We are still waiting for that to happen .
My reason for doing so was simple .
They also seriously damage the indigenous populations .
This time we have proposals for agreements with Guinea and Mauritius , which will have similar effects .
In a way , that much is recognised in the current proposals .
More stringent checks are being called for .
But that is not enough .
There is no guarantee that these agreements will be properly policed .
By any standards , this is preposterous .
Not only will I vote against these proposals , but I shall urge my government to oppose them .
European ships fish there for fish species that are used by the local fishermen .
These trawlers will fish in the coastal zone , where they are a direct threat to local fishermen .
All Member State ships should respect an economic twelve-mile exclusion zone .
I am critical of a number of other points .
I believe it is a sound agreement .
This means that the sums set aside for this purpose will also mainly be spent in these countries .
There is something to be said for this alone .
It is quite clear that regional elements are going to play a more prominent role .
The protocol with Guinea-Conakry is a good example .
Why do these differences exist ?
Could you please explain this once and for all .
The rapporteur rightly mentioned the agreement with Morocco several times .
Perhaps he could give an answer when he comments on the debate later on .
We cannot overlook the concern about fisheries agreements .
They are expensive and the amount of money involved is substantial .
This new protocol is the fourth since the Framework Agreement came into force in 1990 .
Licence fees for ship owners have been considerably increased , from EUR 20 to EUR 25 per tonne .
Since 1983 , we have also maintained a Framework Agreement with the Republic of Guinea .
It also , to some degree , offers an alternative to Moroccan waters .
Finally , the protocol provides for close cooperation between both parties in administering the measures .
Many thanks for your attention .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
We have exhausted the agenda and ourselves , I think .
Ladies and gentlemen , I bid you goodnight .
( The sitting was closed at 11.25 p.m. )
Annex - formal sitting
Your joint visit is unprecedented in the history of this institution .
( Applause )
Your may rest assured that we shall be listening to your words with the utmost attention .
Without further ado , I shall give the floor first to Mr Abu Ala and then to Mr Burg .
Your great experience will prove invaluable in this .
Palestine is thus the home of the prophets of peace .
This situation contributed greatly to paving the way for violence and war .
In order for such a peace to be lasting and general , however , it had to be fair .
The peace process was launched in Madrid in 1991 .
What were our positions ?
Otherwise , any solution would be truncated or incomplete .
This is the case with Egypt , Jordan and Lebanon .
This is a further factor in maintaining the division between the two parties on this subject .
Our positions have actually been rather flexible .
That it the situation up to and after Camp David .
Europe has always had an important role to play throughout the world .
We welcome its involvement in the Middle East peace process .
There is not such a great price to pay for peace , so let us pay it !
We are talking about rights , justice , legitimacy and international law .
Only then will you be able to assess the situation .
With patience we shall reach a successful conclusion .
I am confident that , with your help , we shall reach a successful conclusion .
( Loud and sustained applause )
Thank you , Mr Ahmed Qurie , Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council ,
Mr Burg , you have the floor .
It cannot be right for Members to be subjected to this kind of baseless innuendo .
Mr President , we very frequently complain about the Council 's attitude towards Parliament .
We had the reports from the President of the Council and the Commissioner followed by a debate took place .
Now then , I cannot understand this Parliament for complaining about the Council 's behaviour .
We have no use for people like that acting the fool in Denmark .
I made a very simple request to the President on Monday .
The President agreed to my request and referred the matter to the Quaestors .
We now know the essence of the issue .
Everyone will do what they think best .
Right to family reunification
She deserves the credit for the work that has been done .
I wish to congratulate her on that .
Very clearly , the importance of legal immigration is recognised .
This convention requires states to ensure that the child is not separated from the parents .
This has been a matter of some debate within the committee .
May I briefly introduce some of the amendments that the committee 's report puts forward .
Amendment No 5 deals with relatives from the ascending line .
The right to respect for family life is a universal human right .
It is not divisible and cannot be reserved for EU citizens alone .
Unfortunately , it failed to place this draft directive in an overall frame of reference .
In addition , Parliament is expected to vote on a legislative initiative which lacks absolute fundamental principles .
Unfortunately , the lack of overall strategy and statistical basis are not the only weak points .
The Commission lumps economically motivated immigration and asylum together .
This will allow for provisions that do justice to the people concerned and the situations they are in .
Many of my proposed amendments have this distinction in view .
Another problem with the present draft directive concerns the widening of the definition of family .
Grandparents , children over the age of majority and non-married partners should also be entitled to family reunification .
That is where the dilemma lies : there is no overall frame of reference for immigration .
As such , family reunification is currently the only legal channel of immigration .
The proposed sweeping provisions on family reunification are open to uncontrollable abuse .
Another cardinal sin committed by the Commission is that its proposal contains no measures whatsoever for integration .
However , this draft directive seems to be a poor first attempt at this .
Thank you for your attention .
Mr President , I am sorry to hear Mrs Klamt ' s words .
This issue is so important that we must make an effort to reach a consensus .
All of our groups were in agreement in committee , apart from the PPE Group .
We have also applied these rules we are debating to people who are under alternative protection .
This is an injustice which needs remedying .
This seems to us perverse .
It is important to be absolutely clear on unmarried partners .
That is stirring up homophobic prejudice and I deplore it .
The Commission has taken this resolution forward .
This directive is conclusive as it stands , and should be transposed with all haste .
There is , after all , a great deal to be considered .
However , opinion is being stirred up against this directive in the political arena .
I hope the Socialists will refrain from making this deal with the Conservatives .
In recognising this , the text helps to give real meaning to the term ' integration ' .
I therefore hope that subsequent work by the Commission and Parliament will take its inspiration from this example .
Immigration is not a problem .
These are the considerable risks resulting from this policy trend .
This is , quite manifestly , the suicide of Europe .
The wording on the outside belies the actual contents of these documents .
As far as we are concerned , the proposal under discussion is unacceptable .
( Applause from the right )
This is utterly false .
It is up to us to seize this opportunity . Otherwise we will not succeed .
Mr President , I am of the firm opinion that this draft directive is a major step forward .
That said , restrictive conditions are still being placed on the process of family reunification .
No one would dispute the fact that families have the right to live together .
But what really matters here is where we draw the line as regards family members .
In other words , we must be sensible and draw the line somewhere .
That is the crucial problem we face with this directive .
This sends out another signal to would-be immigrants , which will , of course , have major consequences .
I would be very interested to see how you intend to justify today ' s decision to your electorate .
I feel this is unworthy of you .
In other words , there is admissibility .
That is the fact of the matter .
In this way , it would be possible ....
It gives free rein to all kinds of interpretations .
There is only one thing we can do here , and that is reject this proposal .
I should like to thank all the Members who have taken part in the debate .
It is difficult to find common ground at European level .
Above all , however , this debate has one fundamental feature .
The Commission considers your opinion to be of the utmost importance .
This is not a matter of going back on a question of principle .
I am sorry , but the text is quite clear !
It is not possible to apply for a second wife to come !
Full details will be given before the vote is taken .
I respect the opinions of all Members .
I should like the final opinion of Parliament to have as broad a support-base as possible .
Thank you Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
Movement and residence of EU citizens
This question is : what in fact does European citizenship really mean ?
This is the context in which I wish to place this debate .
I will just give the broad guidelines of these directives .
The transposition of these directives was doubly problematic .
On the one hand , the directives were transposed extremely slowly throughout the Union .
What is more , the Commission had to initiate fourteen infringement procedures .
Let us now proceed to a concrete assessment of the situation .
The notion of adequate means is incorrectly interpreted by governments .
What income is to be taken into account when evaluating means ?
What evidence must be provided ?
I will now present the main measures advocated with a view to overcoming these problems .
This reworking of the existing directives must dissociate the fundamental right of movement and residence from any economic considerations .
These measures must be concomitant with simplifying administrative procedures and providing documents free of charge .
Harmonising social protection systems and pension systems is vital .
I would like to finish by clarifying a number of points .
Rights must be attached to the individual and the individual must take the rights with him wherever he goes .
Perhaps it is time that people acquired the same rights as the products they consume .
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur .
In what circumstances I cannot imagine .
I would not want to see any citizens treated in the same way as these students .
You can move a sack of potatoes around Europe more easily than a citizen can move .
This means that those who are weakest economically are still discriminated against .
Freedom of movement for labour is protected by the legislation of the internal market .
Firstly , Member States are wavering when it comes to implementing Community law provisions on residence rights .
In particular , subordinate authorities in the Member States are unfamiliar for the most part with the relevant provisions .
Secondly , the problems associated with the recognition of diplomas are hugely restrictive .
The problem is that Mrs Boumediene-Thiery widens the scope of these directives to include citizens of third countries .
It would give rise to so-called marriages of convenience or false marriages , and that amounts to fraud ..
The same would apply to students .
Secondly , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report .
Within the framework of this debate , I should like to home in on four specific points .
We therefore give this report by Mrs Boumediene-Thiery our unconditional support .
In saying that , I am not overlooking the economic benefits of free movement .
So why does the Right ignore this ?
Those rules are far too complicated anyway .
It is not too much to ask .
We support Mrs Boumediene-Thiery ' s report .
Finally , the time has come to promote a European citizenship that is based on residence .
Sadly , this is very often not the case .
Either we have a European Union based on law or we do not .
I therefore commend my Amendment No 14 to this House .
It is a very good report .
Unfortunately , in two minutes all I can do is talk about some of its failings .
I am generally in favour of free movement but I think it needs to be limited .
I hope that the Danish Government will use the provisions in this instance .
Equally , we need to make sure that the system is not abused .
I agree with Mr Tannock in principle .
Of course the royal families of Europe should be allowed to move about freely .
However , I disagree with his priorities .
Therefore , our goal must be to bring about the free movement of pensioners and disabled citizens in Europe .
Mr Fatuzzo , you have made me think very carefully about where I shall travel to in old age .
Commissioner Vitorino has the floor .
The Commission is counting a great deal on the support of the European Parliament when the time comes .
However , there are still cases where these directives are incorrectly applied .
The action of the Commission also applies to the laws of Member States .
We are currently working on this .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 12 noon .
Environmental effects of certain programmes
The SEA Directive constitutes a very important step towards an approach of this kind .
This has been discussed in Amendments 2 and 21 .
We do not permit whole categories of plans and programmes to be exempt .
This possibility was not mentioned at all in the Committee ' s discussion .
I really do not think that the proposal is a genuinely serious one .
Amendments 11 and 31 also worry me a little .
I understand the concerns of colleagues from Germany and some parts of Italy .
These result from the way in which some governments and regional governments have chosen to implement the assessments .
It is not the big hand of Europe extending control to local planning matters .
Mr President , the directive we are about to vote on represents a major step forwards .
The amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment substantially improve the Council 's common position .
I therefore feel that this is a sound text overall .
Mr President , every day it is drawn to our attention that the environment is changing .
They must therefore feature in a better way in political work , too .
It is a matter of urgency that economic activity should be included in the environmental assessment .
This is a major and important issue .
We are basically in favour of the proposal of the Environment Committee and its rapporteur .
Provided , of course , that the necessary precautions are taken .
I would also like to stress the importance of the inclusion of the management of water resources .
We feel it is essential that these assessment studies should be carried out .
Also very important to us is the role of the public , i.e. transparency .
High environmental standards and good health are very closely related .
Planning must not become the sole preserve of those who have an academic qualification .
The Council has dealt with this extensively .
In this connection I have to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work .
It is a delicate flower and we all want it to be a success .
I also want it to be well received by my electorate back home .
Hence I sometimes ask myself the questions that they ask themselves .
The scope of application must be extended to include areas that are financed by the European Union .
This is indefensible in my view .
It is the real issues that count , not having the same thing assessed at every level .
Therefore we must make it clear that a duplication of effort must be avoided .
Accordingly , Guido Sacconi ' s Amendment No 31 has my unequivocal support .
Therefore we must make it clear that the regulation is binding .
We need a binding commitment to the effect that any findings will be acted on .
With this in mind , I wish Mrs Schörling ' s report every success .
This would exclude many plans which have an impact on the environment .
These amendments seem to be inspired by the fear of the assessment being duplicated .
In my view , this fear is not sufficiently justified .
Planning is usually carried out at various levels and each one has its own specific characteristics .
Establishing the best way to deal with these issues will require practical experience .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 12 noon .
Port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues
I am , of course , referring to the Erika directives which are due at a later stage .
Eventually , what mattered most was the fee system , which is , in itself , not unimportant .
You may well ask yourself why this percentage would be of any significance ?
We can go along with this .
Small ports will need to make a considerable effort to accommodate this directive in the foreseeable future .
I would like to thank everyone , and my fellow committee members , in particular .
Captains will also be obliged to use these facilities .
We will only be able to protect the sea if we actually monitor whether waste disposal has taken place .
In this way , although the ships will have to pay , they will also be protected .
Thank you very much , Mr Jarzembowski .
I would have been surprised if Mr Piecyk had not wanted to speak for three minutes !
We would all be delighted if you had even cleaner waters to dive in in Europe .
But the sea is our primary concern .
I believe we are in a position to congratulate each other today .
This is an important step .
Secondly , all ships will have to pay , irrespective of whether or not they use the facilities .
That is the real principle that is being brought into play here for the first time .
The sums involved will not be small ; they will be considerable .
It is true that we cannot be completely satisfied with 30 % .
That much is absolutely clear .
Nevertheless , the 30 % introduces and establishes the principle of a ' no special fee system ' .
Thirdly , all Member States must carry out checks on at least 25 % of shipping .
We should challenge them to increase the number of checks .
If there is no monitoring , there is no point in having any regulations .
I also feel that marine pollution should no longer be treated as a trivial offence .
This procedure has proven to be worthwhile in practice .
Accordingly , it came up with a percentage level for own contributions which far exceeded 50 % .
The outcome of the negotiations is nowhere near the agreed percentage , which is regrettable .
This is why I will be backing this report , albeit not with much enthusiasm .
I would like to thank the rapporteur for having invested so much energy in this project .
It is a step forward .
I hope that this tradition will change under the French Presidency .
This is obviously an extraordinarily large step in the right direction .
It also has to be said that what we have achieved today is a compromise .
In my view , it remains to be seen what effects this will have .
Let us pause and reflect on the scale of the problem .
Mr Bouwman quite rightly referred to Erika .
It is that problem that this particular proposal aims to tackle .
This is indeed a very important date in maritime history .
I am among those who welcome this compromise .
Mr President , first of all , I want to congratulate the rapporteur on a commendable result .
Since March 1998 , the Baltic Recommendation has taken such a system for granted .
In Finland , we have had such a system for waste oil since 1 June .
In that respect , the agreement is a disappointment .
The outcome is , therefore , nonetheless a good one .
However , it will be extremely important to follow up the proposal .
This report goes some way to preventing marine pollution because it deals with ships that discharge waste at sea .
The current version of this directive has the support of everybody .
We are , therefore , taking a great step forward today .
Thank you very much , Mrs de Palacio .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 12 noon .
( The sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and resumed at 12.00 noon )
They had 607 nuclear explosions in the atmosphere between 1949 and 1990 .

Before the start of the vote
( Mixed reactions ) But ladies and gentlemen , this list is the result of your own interventions .
Should it be targeted or random ?
We have a speaker to oppose the motion .
Madam President , I cannot understand what the PPE wants .
I therefore ask that we go ahead with the vote on this Commission proposal .
Thank you , Mrs Terrón i Cusí .
I will ask our rapporteur to express an opinion , if he wishes .
Madam President , I oppose referral back to committee .
I see no reason not to proceed to a vote .
Thank you , Mr Watson .
That is very clear .
( Parliament rejected the request for referral to committee )
Before the vote on the Commission proposal
Madam President , forgive me for butting in at this point .
I have a question for Mr Vitorino before we come to the final vote .
You said this morning that you would endorse Amendment No 19 at today ' s vote .
I just wanted to confirm that you will indeed accept Amendment No 19 .
I promise to think about it .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Before the start of the vote
I therefore think that the objection raised by Mr Barón Crespo is not a valid one .
This has always been the case in this House .
( Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution )
Joint motion for a resolution on EU external action priorities
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Joint motion for a resolution on the creation of a monitoring centre for industrial change
Before the start of the vote
I do not see any sign of them doing so .
Yes , Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel , you have the floor .
Parliament was divided between supporters of two different solutions .
In normal administrative relations , this decision by Parliament would be final ; not so in the European Union .
Around the Mediterranean Sea , however , there was preference for payment according to the waste collected .
This is prejudicing the northern model .
This fee would help finance 90 % of the cost of these facilities .
It was clear that the Council would not accept such a proposal .
The discussion was then continued , quite logically , within the Conciliation Committee .
I am satisfied with the compromise we have reached .
This is just a first step . It recognises the polluter-pays principle .
It is a necessary step , but it does not go far enough .
Let us make no bones about it .
For the time being , I can only recommend that Parliament accepts the results of this conciliation procedure .
Morillon recommendation ( A5-0206 / 2000 )
Madam President , I voted for the recommendation .
Why was it that these points were not incorporated into the document ? "
This is my minor criticism of the document we have voted on .
The European Parliament must insist on the three amendments :
on protecting cultural identity and abolishing the death penalty ;
on contributing to the solution of the Kurdish problem .
That is why I voted for these amendments .
During this part-session , the European Parliament has plumbed the depths of hypocrisy .
It is time your deeds reflected your words .
Schörling report ( A5-0196 / 2000 )
Nonetheless , the report does have some shortcomings .
This text has been lurking the procedural labyrinth for nigh on 5 years .
We are well aware of the powers of the Union , and we know its arsenal .
We say no to this .
Valdivielso de Cué report ( A5-0204 / 2000 )
Better still , I would like to see an increase in the MEDA regulation ' s financial appropriations .
This is why I voted for this report .
And these are indeed the purposes served by the MEDA funding programme .
Europe is going to expand eastwards .
This is written in Agenda 2000 .
But Europe has a fluid border to the south , conditioned by its geography .
It is a tidal wave that is going to grow year by year .
And this is the aim of the common-sense MEDA programme .
Admittedly , it is good to have moved from bilateral aid to a global , multilateral approach .
European farmers would be happy with an increase that was twice , three times less than that .
But that does not constitute a Mediterranean policy .
A Mediterranean policy is not more programmes and more officials in Brussels to manage them .
It should be further developed and deepened .
The report concedes that free trade agreements carry this risk .
In this way , each individual agreement adds one more brick to fortress Europe .
The countries of the southern Mediterranean region have been declared as the forecourts to fortress Europe .
It is their duty to ensure that ' undesirable persons ' do not get into the EU .
This report safeguards , once again , the free movement of goods , services and capital .
Once again , freedom and human rights are trampled underfoot .
I will therefore vote against it , despite the fact that it contains a number of positive elements .
We cannot be satisfied with such a record .
The best we can do now is to back the amendments proposed by the European Commission .
Varela Suanzes-Carpegna reports ( A5-0194 and A5-0188 / 2000 )
Well , I think that this is a form of colonialism which must be stopped .
Unfortunately , this amendment was not adopted .
In my view , that is not a good move .
Watson report ( A5-0201 / 2000 )
Madam President , I would like to explain the votes on behalf of the ELDR Group .
Some of us in my group , however , would have liked us to express a more generous stance .
Mrs Malmström and Mrs van der Laan have asked me specifically to mention them in this connection .
But just one person living on the minimum social security pension goes hungry .
How can an immigrant with such a low income make all his relatives go hungry ?
The truth is that the host State does not force the immigrants to move there .
The proposal for a directive approved by the Watson report is not content to proclaim this non-existent law .
It concerns the issue of family reunification .
At national level , situations are extremely disparate .
It was therefore crucial to incorporate the law on family reunification into Community legislation .
Consequently , those belonging to one of the following categories will benefit from the law on family reunification :
Those entitled to claim family reunification are :
I speak on behalf of myself and my 28 colleagues from the British Labour Party .
The majority of these foreign nationals , i.e. 87 % , are from EU countries .
Almost a third of the work force , 80 000 people that is , are cross-border commuters .
Over half of the working population does not have Luxembourg citizenship .
I am wholeheartedly in favour of family reunification .
But how is the family to be defined ?
Naturally , where Member States already have more generous provisions , they should be able to retain them .
Nothing could be further from the truth !
As Swedish Christian Democrats , we believe that these groups ought to be dealt with separately .
With these reservations and qualifications , we support the report .
This is an unacceptable situation .
We used to have a different system , which was better organised .
There is no need to get angry , Mrs Lulling .
You are therefore free to go .
I do not understand the problem .
Why is it that our services cannot give us simple and straightforward information ?
Why have I had to waste half an hour here ?
Mr de Rossa , I have been told that this was a misunderstanding .
You were told that you had to be present for the vote .
Thank you for your understanding .
Creating a monitoring centre for industrial change
To sum up , this monitoring centre must be used as an instrument for anticipating industrial change .
The centre ' s studies will , of course , be widely distributed .
EU external action priorities
Veltroni report ( A5-209 / 2000 )
The important aspects of the intervention of the European Union are :
3 ) The promotion of linguistic diversity .
4 ) The protection of minors using new programme control methods .
6 ) The support of the public audiovisual sector with the option of broadcasting on a global scale .
Such adaptation is actually crucial , given recent developments in digital technology .
We will only achieve this if we respect the principles governing this field , which are :
the protection of pluralism :
the possibility of targeting intervention to provide strategic support for services of general interest :
the effectiveness of copyright protection is jeopardised in the digital age .
Heaton-Harris report ( A5-0199 / 2000 )
This means that there is definitely something which is not working properly !
We are delighted that this report , to which we contributed several amendments , has been adopted .
Boumediene-Thiery report ( A5-0207 / 2000 )
When will we put an end to this injustice ?
Various Community instruments have enabled this right to become a reality .
Many people have doubts about admitting Malta to the European Union .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.50 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m. )
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
I did not state that .
It was just a possibility , not a statement .
That is important .
In the Minutes it sounds as though I am making an accusation .
I would not dare to say so , because I have no proof at all .
It is merely a possibility .
Is that clear ?
It will therefore clarify whether you said one thing or another .
That was the problem .
You can write to the services to correct your words .
Apparently the services understood something else .
But you are entitled to correct your words .
Right now there is no problem .
That is why I cannot say ...
Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso , the plenary does not adopt the verbatim report of proceedings .
We adopt the Minutes .
So if you have a problem ...
( The President was interrupted ) Please , respect the presidency .
We take note of your remarks on the Minutes .
You can write to the services to correct the verbatim report .
That is all .
( The Minutes were approved )
The next item is the Commission statement on telecommunications mergers .
I want to briefly pick up on some of the crucial points that he made .
Many of the ideas related to market share are also changing very rapidly .
That is extremely important .
It will be interesting to hear how you envisage your service developing in this direction .
Could you perhaps address these points when you respond to our debate later on ?
This really is a dilemma for Parliament and for the Commission .
We welcome the position that you have taken on this particular issue .
This is politically if not technically an unbalanced situation which merits the attention of this House .
At that time , comparisons were made .
We must provide all citizens with access to this new information society .
The Internet must continue to be a means of communication for all .
We must therefore prevent the telecommunications and media giants from being able to occupy a dominant position .
Competition law is an effective tool to this end .
However , mergers also have an impact on employment and social cohesion .
Telecommunications and media are not crisis-ridden industries ; they are an expanding sector .
We are calling for the EU to introduce binding social clauses into the mergers approvals process .
Secondly , they should improve the quality of service for large sections of their customer base .
Fourthly , the merger must bring added benefits when it comes to furthering the public interest .
This is part of the ongoing framework programme to improve the quality of telecommunications services in Europe .
EU leaders pointed to the need to improve our overall telecommunications services .
I support the recommendation that all schools in Europe must be equipped with the Internet .
For the good of ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
These cases have increased dramatically in number recently .
Mr Harbour presented the telecom package .
It just shows what a furious pace this industry is moving along at .
It demands a lot from all of us in terms of skills .
The telecommunications and IT sectors are special .
These are in a way beyond the control and vigilance of everyone .
We therefore support the Commission ' s proposals and we would like to draw attention to this aspect .
There is no doubting that this is a challenge !
May I welcome the Commissioner to Parliament today on behalf of all of us .
We all appreciate the importance of your task in the competition department of the Commission .
We want to see an end to the advantages inherited by some of the old state monopolies .
The reverse is often true .
That is why we should support the Commission ' s decision in matters such as WorldCom and Sprint .
We hope this will not prove to be to the detriment of competition policy .
Please excuse me , for I shall have to be extremely brief in my answers .
This is indeed one of our key concerns .
You referred to the outcome of the Commission 's peer group preview .
One particularly effective way to maintain a lead is to make the market run efficiently .
The Commission also resolutely opposes any such legislation in our Member States .
Mr Ortuondo Larrea , Mr Markov and Mr Rapkay referred to the very important AOL-Time Warner case .
You will appreciate that I cannot say very much now .
The deadline for the Commission 's decision is 24 October .
The hearing on this merger is taking place today and tomorrow in Brussels .
We expressed our concerns on 22 August when we issued our statement of objections to the parties .
There is nothing else I can add at this stage .
The auctions will increase the number of mobile telephone operators in the Union .
So we are trying to be vigilant as all of you urge us to be .
We have to examine situations case by case .
Size can sometimes create problems .
Even smaller operators can create competition problems and then we have to intervene .
I must be very brief at this stage .
This raises two issues .
This has clearly been the case in the telecommunication industry .
The Commission is extremely keen that workers ' rights should be safeguarded .
However the Commission welcomes the involvement of workers ' representatives in the merger control process .
Representatives have a right to be heard at all stages of the procedure .
I know from experience that their views are a valuable input for my services .
Thank you very much , Mr Monti , for your detailed reply .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday .
The next item is the Commission statement on human cloning .
This research is being carried out with respect for fundamental ethical principles and for the relevant national regulations .
This is also one of the objectives of the European research area , which is gradually being developed .
I wish to ask a question regarding the agenda .
Mr Busquin has just made a statement about cloning .
When will the debate on this subject be held ?
At 5 p.m. in other words , immediately after the debate on enlargement .
Comments by Mr Verheugen concerning enlargement
I welcome President Prodi to the Chamber and I thank him for being present .
For my part , I fear that the public is not yet sufficiently convinced .
In particular , the national procedures for ratifying enlargement are purely national issues .
I cited the Treaty of Maastricht as an example of this , and not enlargement .
Finally , I also said that the German constitution makes no provision for this .
But what was the real message ?
We want to secure peace and stability throughout Europe .
We want to boost Europe ' s role in international competition .
We have no alternative .
Since the Prodi Commission took office , the outcome of the enlargement negotiations has been positive .
We need to have a wide-ranging , democratic debate on this historic project .
These were the basic ideas I wanted to bring out in the interview .
The strategy has been laid down by the European Council .
The Commission pursues this strategy with vigour .
Three conclusions can be drawn from this , to my mind .
The Commission has already made the necessary preparations to this end .
I am thinking , in particular , of the border regions .
The Commission is working on a programme here too .
But there are ways and means of solving these problems .
( Applause )
It centres on a grave occurrence , a serious political error .
It was not the President , but the Commission whom we asked for a statement .
Commissioner Verheugen , I have read your interview several times .
Mr Verheugen , what is your understanding of Parliament ' s role ?
You would not be in office if we had not given you our blessing .
I simply refuse to accept this .
( Applause )
We have a joint task to get to grips with for Europe .
Turning now to the facts of the matter .
But I am pleased that the matter has been cleared up today .
( Heckling )
Please do not get excited .
The Commission and Parliament must tread the same path if we are to approach the future with confidence .
( Applause )
We must now join forces and urge the national governments to make a success of Nice .
We must do this together , in a spirit of good will and cooperation .
As Members of the European Parliament , we are committed to this on an ongoing basis .
The reunification of Germany would not have been possible without Solidarnosc in Poland .
( Applause )
Parliament is agreed that we must tread this path together .
Mr Verheugen , I would urge you to take this to heart .
( Loud applause )
We want the negotiations to be resolved speedily and diligently .
We reject any attempt to put new obstacles in the way of accession .
( Applause )
You have clarified matters to our satisfaction .
That is the key objective .
However , we are all to be found wanting in this respect .
That is the message we must drive home .
Let us give our work the epoch-making status it deserves !
We must not allow anyone to wreck this opportunity , nor must we waste it .
( Applause )
I therefore especially welcome his statement today .
On the matter of a referendum I accept his explanation .
However the underlying thesis is correct .
I am sure that implication was not intended .
That cannot be substantiated .
Such a slur on our interinstitutional relationship must not be allowed to stand .
( Applause )
Nothing is more important than this .
This is not serious enlargement work .
A referendum in itself is an absolutely splendid way of involving the people in making decisions .
Now let us just consider this Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Madam President , opinion differs in my group as to the proposed enlargement of the European Union .
I would urge you once again to clarify the situation for us .
In July , you dropped some very vague hints about the difficulties .
Despite being asked to do so , you were not prepared to be more specific at the time .
You are absolutely right to say that the people must be involved in the decision-making processes .
But that means of course , that the democratically elected representatives should be given these opportunities too .
But a German referendum must never be allowed to determine the weal and woe of enlargement .
That would be insensitive and unacceptable to my mind .
Then you will have us all on your side .
We have to realise that the European citizens are afraid .
These are major issues and your interview , Commissioner , caused some consternation .
Well , it is not too late .
I have been asked to withdraw this evaluation . I am only too pleased to do so .....
I did not mean anything else by it ......
( Heckling from the Chamber )
This process was concluded as early as the end of 1993 .
There are no further decisions to be made on the subject , the matter is closed .
People said at the time that the public had not been sufficiently involved .
( Applause )
Thank you , Commissioner Verheugen .
I wish to thank Commissioner Verheugen once more and to welcome back Commissioner Busquin .
Human cloning ( continuation )
Otherwise , the world would consist of violence , brutality and cynicism .
We cannot allow man to have such great power over his fellow man .
But this does not mean that we are against research , quite the contrary .
Lastly , we propose that a temporary committee be set up to study these issues .
Such formal statements are not necessarily sufficient .
Scientific advances are mind-boggling .
This applies above all to the new mastery of living mechanisms .
This raft of issues concerns various standing committees in this Parliament .
I welcome the Commissioner 's statement and particularly its measured and considered nature .
The ELDR resolution that has been tabled takes the same view .
I feel that it is extremely important to make two observations at this point .
Why then , given this scenario , should we immediately rush into something that is ethically and socially questionable ?
We therefore need a rigorous legal framework and clear legal guidelines .
Mr Cabanis ' dream is today close to becoming reality .
His dream has a name : eugenics .
This dream is in fact a nightmare .
These embryos are human beings , whose lives are sacred .
They are people .
It is our duty to respect their dignity .
I do not accept this form of intellectual terrorism .
As the wife of a doctor , I am extremely concerned that such research should be allowed to develop .
We must make the difference between the law and religious principles clear .
If we do not observe this principle , then I fear that there will be no hope for us .
We declare a ban and then we wash our hands of the matter .
The real civilisation of the institutions is the civilisation of secularity , experimentation and discussion .
This is less than two years ago .
Meanwhile , the British Government would like to permit therapeutic cloning of embryos for research .
I cannot help thinking that the boundaries are forever being extended .
As if this would explain and justify everything .
What then is the big difference between therapeutic and reproductive cloning of human embryos ?
As far as I am concerned , every new human being is a gift of God .
Any form of human life should be treated with respect .
This is also the only way to safeguard human dignity .
I do wonder why this option is taken , despite all the ethical concerns which exist worldwide .
Mr President , a proud man wants to play God .
He refuses to acknowledge that he is only a creature .
He wants to be the creator .
They argue that human cloning is about the promotion of health .
The impression has been given that only reproductive cloning is banned .
This is completely wrong .
And I do not think that is something you would want .
We as a Parliament must withstand this attempt to shatter taboos .
This also means boycotting the cross-subsidisation provided by research institutes in Great Britain .
Mr President , you should listen to the Commissioner !
No one doubts that either .
I suspect not .
Today ' s debate is positive proof of this suspicion .
And what form has this reaction taken ?
That is all very well , but it is not enough !
I am not alone in calling for this ; I have the backing of my group .
The people of Europe want to see more foresighted commitment from us in this area .
We cannot afford to be overtaken by events any longer .
This revolution must not be attended by irresponsibly conceived legislation .
The appropriate parliamentary committee must therefore get down to work as quickly as possible .
Our vote will set this in train .
What is this really about ?
Who are we to deny people the right to recovery ?
Would it not be too easy to ban promising technology with great potential on ethical grounds ?
Is not every person entitled to health and welfare ?
Who has the right to put the label of ethics on it ?
The people of the European Union are expecting the European Parliament to take a stance on this .
I believe that what is happening now is of crucial importance .
The arbitrary distinction between reproductive and non-reproductive cloning is semantic sleight of hand .
This conflicts with human rights .
That is why Parliament must use its power to act .
This has always been this Parliament ' s position and I think it is useful to restate this .
These implications are , in themselves , medical .
We must make the distinction between therapeutic cloning , which must be clearly differentiated from reproductive cloning .
There are also ethical and philosophical implications .
What status does the embryo have ?
Could they not provide new life ?
There are economic and social implications .
This debate concerns the whole of society .
What is the American or Japanese point of view on these issues ?
There must be an in-depth debate .
You have called for one and we agree .
Safeguards are crucial .
These issues are viewed differently from one country to another , according to their culture .
There is no difference between cloning for therapeutic purposes and cloning for reproductive purposes .
The use of human embryos to produce organs can therefore in no way be justified .
It would certainly be a different matter if mere stem cells were to be used rather than embryos .
We must stop and reflect on the possible implications of upsetting the laws of nature .
The precautionary principle must be invoked and applied to the possibility of cloning for therapeutic purposes .
I believe this is the next logical step .
Why does Great Britain behave differently to the continent ?
That is certainly an interesting question .
The difference obviously does not depend on which government is in power .
Why is public opinion in Great Britain unlike that on the other side of the Channel ?
That was the first comment I wanted to make .
Secondly , I wanted to say how impressed I was with Mrs Bonino ' s comments .
It really struck a chord with me .
I too would advocate that we should allow ourselves to be guided by the laity in matters of principle .
The State is not religious , but it has a duty to respect religion .
But I also want my opinion to be respected .
However this is only possible within a lay context .
Claims of infallibility have already done Europe untold damage .
We should endeavour to leave this behind .
No one has a monopoly on ethics .
People who see things differently are ethical too .
Incidentally , we have seen time and again how bans are watered down in practice .
Everyone could cite examples of this .
In the final reckoning , we will have no choice but to lay down boundaries .
I feel as many other people do about this issue .
There is no need for us to take action at present .
We still have time .
We need to think very carefully about how we are going to proceed in this matter .
This is an emotive subject , not least because of the title ' Human cloning ' .
So let us get some facts straight .
Fact : human reproductive cloning is banned in the UK .
It would perhaps be a good idea if other Member States were to have something similar .
The choice is yours , colleagues .
Caring for your neighbour is also a Christian enjoinder .
He may have Alzheimer 's or Parkinson 's or diabetes .
What does respect for life mean ?
What does the pre-embryo mean in relation to the embryo ?
Do we have the right to authorise research into the embryo for therapeutic purposes ?
Where do the stem cells come from ?
Should embryos be cloned ?
Do stem cells come from foetal tissue as well as from adult tissue ?
Do we have the right to create embryos for any purposes other than for life itself ?
All of these questions are laden with consequences and concern the meaning of life itself .
I must say that his comments were very cautious and carefully measured on this issue .
This debate must also , however , be held in the public domain .
I propose that a European Agency for reproductive and biotechnological medicine be created .
His question concerned the fifth framework-programme .
I simply wanted to clarify this point , Mr Liese , since you asked the question .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon .
Question Time ( Commission )
Question No 41 by ( H-0613 / 00 ) :
Payment of instalments by the Commission is sometimes delayed for years .
Some associations have even had to close down because of delays in payment by the Commission .
These problems have several causes .
In responding to these problems , I am taking a number of steps .
Commissioner , I am pleased to hear that certain measures are to be taken .
That would be a wholly misguided attempt at a solution to my mind .
Question No 42 by ( H-0629 / 00 ) :
Thank you for giving the opportunity to clarify the issue that is the subject of your question .
There has accordingly been no failure in publishing the minutes .
In this case the science was less than adequate .
This exercise brought into some disrepute the precautionary principle .
That principle only holds good if the decisions are scientifically irreproachable .
The Commission made a clear assessment of this issue .
Question No 44 by ( H-0688 / 00 ) :
Water will be a crucial issue for the Middle East in the coming decades .
We also promote the concept of a regional cooperation structure .
Current water management and consumption in the Middle East cannot be sustained .
This discrepancy is even sharper in the Middle East .
Therefore assisting reform of domestic water policies in the countries of the Middle East is a priority .
A call for proposals will be published soon .
Thank you , Commissioner , for your answer .
We all talk about the impending crises over water shortages .
Something must be done .
This must also apply to lakes that belong to more than one country .
The European Commission contributed EUR 1.2 million towards its implementation .
The International Office for Water took charge of the secretariat .
So the Commission is constantly involved in this project , has been for some time and continues to be .
Question No 45 by ( H-0689 / 00 ) :
When will the Commission put forward revised proposals for directives to govern the transport of live animals ?
These checks have revealed certain shortcomings in the compliance of some Member States with the Community legislation .
The report will show that Member States currently have difficulties in fully implementing Community legislation .
You also draw attention to our relationship with the applicant countries .
Commissioner , in accordance with the Rules of Procedure , this is not a supplementary question .
Thank you very much , Mr Byrne , for your cooperation with Parliament this afternoon .
Questions to Mr Vitorino
Question No 46 by ( H-0600 / 00 ) :
We will continue to insist that the charter foresees the prohibition of the employment of children .
In what context and are they proposing to make any input into the conference ?
I will answer with pleasure .
It has already made it clear , that it will be making children 's rights a top priority .
Children are being used by mothers from eastern and central Europe on the streets of our cities for begging .
They are mostly coming into the Union as refugees .
I will consider your suggestions with an open mind .
Question No 47 by ( H-0606 / 00 ) :
The Belgian and Dutch Governments adhered to the prior consultation procedure laid down by the Schengen Agreement .
This is why I say that Community law does not allow for a collective restriction to be imposed .
I should like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for his answer .
I was gunning for Portugal for as long as I possibly could , though .
I know that Great Britain is not a signatory to the Schengen Agreement , but that day may come .
Perhaps next time , Portugal will also be in the final .
It is a fact of the game that sometimes luck is not on your side .
We are now in the process of assessing those measures .
I am currently awaiting this report .
I have a follow-up question also concerning the Schengen Agreement and exemption from the requirement to carry a passport .
What are your views on this ?
Question No 49 by ( H-0692 / 00 ) :
Considerable progress has been achieved so far .
The Portuguese Presidency submitted a draft Council regulation at the end of June 2000 .
This has led to the draft regulation now containing the following approach .
It will function in this form for three years .
Are you proposing to conduct a study on the feasibility aspect ?
You can rely on receiving our full backing for this .
It is urgent to have that second step in order to make the European police college a fixed institution .
The Commission will not drop that idea .
Thank you very much , Mr Vitorino , for your replies this afternoon .
Question No 50 will be replied to in writing .
Questions to Mrs Diamantopoulou
Question No 51 by ( H-0647 / 00 ) :
Harmonisation is deemed to be impossible .
This put forward a two-pronged approach .
Commissioner , thank you very much for providing these clarifications .
Could you give an update on this directive on a single market for additional pensions ?
We are currently at the debating stage .
Question No 52 by ( H-0649 / 00 ) :
I am bound to say that their contribution to this dialogue was extremely significant .
Secondly , NGOs feel that they are being unfairly denied access to core funding .
Sometimes there is confusion at national level .
Question No 53 by ( H-0675 / 00 ) :
What is the unemployment rate in Greece at present ?
To what extent is the Greek Government meeting the undertakings it gave regarding the above-mentioned matters ?
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The figures are more or less as you gave them .
Secondly , you said we would have the results by the end of 2001 .
I just wonder what we can discuss on this basis .
I apologise for having to say this , but I have run out of patience .
And I think that what you have said thus far also speaks for itself .
The information that does exist even shows that things are getting worse .
So what will change in the 2000-2006 period ?
So far , 24 have been established .
The action plan for employment for 2000 contains these undertakings .
As the author is not present , Question No 54 lapses .
Questions Nos 55 , 56 and 57 will be replied to in writing .
Questions to Mr Fischler
Question No 58 by ( H-0602 / 00 ) :
Since then , however , the association in question has heard nothing more .
However , as you are aware , there is a proposal to amend this directive .
Mr President , Mr Sacconi , that is easy enough to explain .
Question No 59 by ( H-0609 / 00 ) :
It is therefore not entitled to loss of income grants .
The Irish Government contested this financial rectification in so-called mediation negotiations .
It is a semi-state company and it is responsible for forestry development .
Now it actually used the money it was getting from these interest payments on land that they were purchasing .
They are now saying that the state will have to pay it back which is not acceptable either .
Mr President , there is really nothing I can add to that .
What Mrs McKenna has just had to say describes and elucidates precisely the Commission ' s position .
Question No 61 by ( H-0618 / 00 ) :
You are right in principle .
All Member States will have to respect the same acquis communitaire in the long run .
Therefore , there can only be one common agricultural policy and not two different ones .
That is , after all , the point of having transitional arrangements .
After all , it is precisely this issue that the enlargement negotiations are focussing on .
Question No 62 by ( H-0633 / 00 ) :
What does the Commission consider would be a realistic timetable for carrying out the necessary changes ?
This led to radical reform of the tobacco sector in 1998 .
Secondly , research activities have been stepped up , financed by the Community tobacco fund .
The appropriations for said fund were doubled .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am grateful for your replies .
This is a question of redirecting aid in support of other products .
The social implications , and the effect on income were also assessed during this analysis .
I will gladly make the documents you have requested available to you .
It is quite ironic really .
But I am keen to acquaint myself with them .
We know that tobacco growers in the Member States have different priorities .
There will be no decline in tobacco consumption until we have succeeded in driving this message home to consumers .
We are deluding ourselves if we think we can control the problem from the supply side .
In economic terms , the only way to achieve this is to alter patterns in demand .
Thank you very much , Mr Fischler , for your replies .
Questions Nos 63 to 109 will be replied to in writing .
That concludes Questions to the Commission .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.25 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
In which areas has significant progress been made ?
Firstly , the directive is strictly binding in legislative terms .
Third , there was the important and sensitive matter of groundwater .
Nonetheless , we shall all have to be vigilant .
Firstly with regard to all the daughter directives , which will implement the framework directive .
We shall be involved in the codecision procedure to determine the list of priority substances and priority hazardous substances .
A first report has already been examined by the Commission and a rapporteur has been appointed .
The second major task for this House will be the substance of the framework directive on groundwater .
In short , I think we have done the bulk of the work .
The experts ' statements confirmed our concerns .
The idea of the current Water Framework Directive was born at that time .
In February 1996 , the European Commission tabled its proposals in the form of a communication .
The definitive , official Commission proposal was finally ready in February 1998 .
Finally , mention should be made of the guarantee that codecision will apply in connection with future procedures .
Welcome as this result is , we cannot , however , rest on our laurels .
The Water Framework Directive now needs to be put into effect .
It was a pleasure for me to cooperate with a colleague in this way .
My own special thanks go to you , Mrs Lienemann , and our own staff here in Parliament .
Agriculture and forestry , however , are still problems , with their diffuse discharges .
More needs to be done about this .
If the Spanish wish to pollute their water , they should do just that .
But the tide of deregulation has turned .
We now have a substantial legislative document of 60 pages , with 90 pages of appendix .
The Greens feel that 80 % of this document has been a success .
What was disappointing was the water price policy .
What is successful is the fact that we have a new principle for chemical substances .
I think we can be proud of this .
Mr President , the conciliation has been quite difficult .
This has to do with the fact that the subject is itself both extensive and technically very complicated .
That would have been desirable .
In certain respects the directive forms a framework whose contents are still unclear .
This is especially true in the case of the phasing-out of dangerous substances .
This is an issue upon which further work will be done in the daughter directives .
We shall therefore be happy to vote in favour of the proposal .
Yet the objectives are timid , vague and extremely long term .
This should be provided for by law .
A simple , uniform and coordinated Community law on the protection of water and groundwater is to be welcomed .
The tasks are therefore broadly defined .
The calls for zero limit values can hardly be met by means of legislation alone .
Transposing the directive presents a genuine challenge for the Member States of the European Community .
I agree with the rapporteur : it is only through cooperation that success can be achieved .
Parliament ' s really quite significant victory consists in the fact that this directive is to be binding .
A further important victory for MEPs involved the protection of groundwater .
Will we achieve this objective ?
I would like to make two points to emphasise the importance of integrated water management :
At the moment , it is a hugely politically-charged issue .
Many have to pay to sink their own pump in Ireland and pay the electricity charges .
Mr President , I believe that today we are witnessing an important act .
Furthermore , they have carried out serious work on a highly complex subject .
I would ask for this to be re-examined , for the terminology in each country is quite distinct .
It would be a poor show if the legal texts did not contain the correct and necessary terminology .
I would therefore ask for this matter to be looked into again .
In the German version alone , I have found more than twenty mistakes .
I happily leave it to you to examine this matter .
If this is not the case , it will be withdrawn in the near future .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
However , I am very grateful to you that we have got through all this .
A number of years ago , the European institutions made the right decision to attend to private motoring .
We have introduced rigid quotas , without which no progress can be made .
Unfortunately , we have missed that opportunity , something I particularly regret .
One general point - and also a disputed one in this House - was the question of costs .
And that is my overall objection to this Directive .
We need more , not less , input from the market in this area .
This is a wrong decision , which I very much regret because it will have consequences .
Cost allocation is therefore not as simple as all that .
I should really have liked things to have worked out differently , but I accept the majority decision .
I believe it will do so .
I would thank the Commission and the Council and , once again , my fellow MEPs .
It has been a pleasure to work with you .
Mr President , I too have reason to thank Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz .
Instead , they will have to be properly disposed of on the spot by authorised companies .
For me , that is one of the great , fundamental successes of this directive .
That is the crucial thing .
I hope too that we do not allow ourselves to be put under pressure by individual industrial interests .
Lastly , it is important to highlight another point too , which is of a more specific political-institutional nature .
For the first time , European legislation defines manufacturer ' s liability in no uncertain terms .
This has proved ineffective in practice .
We are now dealing with manufacturer ' s liability in the case of end-of-life vehicles .
Unfortunately , the text stipulates that the manufacturer will be wholly or mainly responsible .
In the case of the electronic and electrical waste directive , this must be regulated more effectively .
We need to move towards individual manufacturer ' s liability .
My own country , the Netherlands , has a great deal to learn in this respect .
It should be noted that the Commission 's initial proposal was presented in July 1997 .
Many thanks , Mr President .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Air transport and the environment
What are the environmental impacts of this growth ?
On the contrary , global aviation policies are actually encouraging the unrestrained growth of this sector .
Aviation is massively subsidised .
This would be a first step to reverse the current exemption of international aviation from responsibilities .
This does not spell the end of ICAO .
Others do just the same thing .
The reaction of the airlines is to ask why we are picking on them .
In fact , clearly the opposite is the case .
The airlines have been getting away with not paying their way for over 50 years .
That is nonsense .
They claim it will have crippling effects on the European economy and that too is nonsense .
So I commend this report to you .
Unfortunately this has been built upon by the rapporteur .
In the United Kingdom alone aviation is responsible for supporting nearly 500 000 jobs .
Aviation is responsible for just 2.5 % of CO2 emissions .
National governments must take action now .
It is not subsidised .
Their supporters would love to abolish cheap flights .
I would hope in future the proposals from the Commission are thought through more carefully .
Mr President , allow me to start by congratulating the rapporteur , Mrs Lucas .
My group has not proposed any further amendments for this plenary discussion .
We therefore endorse the key points of the Commission proposals .
But today we are merely tracing an outline .
What conditions must European legislation meet ?
So what are the guiding principles of the Group of the Party of European Socialists ?
Accordingly , we are expecting ambitious proposals from the European Commission .
However , the viability of these ideas and proposals is questionable .
As stated in the report , we would like international consultation and further research .
We hope that international consultation will bear some fruit .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report .
It is indeed the case that aviation is growing rapidly .
I would like to highlight a few points .
There are specific reasons for this , but something must be done about the matter .
I believe that this is a factor of importance .
Hence my amendment to provide details of these measures .
One of the effects of this is particularly detrimental to the peripheral parts of the country .
I did not enter politics to repeat the Highland clearances .
The latter should instead concentrate on correctly carrying out its already vast range of tasks .
In these circumstances , we cannot accept the instigation of this eco-tax .
We cannot accept this .
Furthermore , we demand that tax subsidiarity in favour of the Member States be observed .
The political dependency of the Member States depends in large part on their freedom in terms of tax .
The eco-tax will solve nothing .
This is a purely ideological measure , with no direct effect on the environment .
However , we finally reached a majority agreement .
So let us be realistic , please .
We have to protect our citizens from unnecessary noise .
This , however , does require sufficient expertise and alternatives .
At present , there is room for considerable improvement with regard to both of these aspects .
This report sets the right tone for this , especially for the benefit of the Commission .
I am referring to the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens and the regionalists .
I would like to highlight a number of points .
In my opinion , the European Union should support the ICAO process .
We should however urge caution .
We only have two manufacturers .
The consequences for European aviation are not hard to imagine .
Air fares would go up .
That is why the new standards cannot be put on hold forever .
Finally , I would like to say a few words on noise-sensitive airports .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to give Mrs Lucas credit for her report .
I mean her original version .
It is part of sustainable development to reduce emissions and bring noise levels down .
The report gained the support of everyone in the committee .
The amendments made to it , however , throw the baby out with the bath water .
For example , the time span for noise reduction is very long .
A long journey is a long way to go .
There is no doubt that it is within the ICAO that this work needs to be done .
We await Parliament 's vote , to which the Commission will pay great attention .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Tyres for motor vehicles and trailers
Noise is an environmental and health problem which is underestimated .
For example , the European Commission ' s proposal did not contain a review clause .
All environmental proposals made by the European Commission contain a review clause , but not this one .
It should have been dealt with in the Council of Ministers for the Environment .
With regard to ordinary passenger cars , we suggest that the limit is reduced by 2 decibels .
The German independent inspection body , TÜV , has tested numerous existing car tyres .
They all meet the ineffective noise limits proposed by the Council .
A reduction of 2 decibels is technically possible without jeopardising safety .
This has also been confirmed by experts of the Swedish institute for roads and traffic .
Vans and lorries produce more noise than ordinary cars .
This seems ample time to me .
More is required , of course , in order to reduce the noise from road traffic .
We will be returning to the problems of noise when we deal with the directive on noise .
Cars inherently cause a large number of environmental problems .
Similarly , we found a sound solution to the recycling of end-of-life vehicles in the Florenz report .
There are now two major environmental issues left to tackle at European level .
I would welcome a positive reaction from the European Commission .
I am no lawyer and am not in a position to judge .
In contrast , the tyre industry has largely refrained from taking action .
It is in this area that we want them to do some catching up .
We shall doubtless at some stage also have to talk about alternative road surfaces in Europe .
I believe that this is a positive way of forcing the tyre industry to act .
Obviously , we want to maintain standards .
This is the road we should be going down .
Now , these tyres are not particularly unsafe .
On the contrary .
I would ask you to consider that this does not yet mean the end of the negotiations .
However , we must also have room for manoeuvre .
Now turning to tyres .
It has consulted with the industry .
Some of our colleagues are seeking to sabotage this careful work by demanding arbitrary and ill-considered decibel reductions .
In some cases their figures are achievable , in others not .
Let me speak plainly .
More road users will die if Mr de Roo 's amendments are passed .
The electors I represent will not thank us .
We are being far too prescriptive .
It is our job to set a broad legislative framework in the public interest .
I call on colleagues to reject the amendments and support the Commission proposal .
Mr President , I welcome this proposal .
It is long overdue .
I understand the desire of my colleague , Mr de Roo , to take the standards further .
However , I have to sound a note of caution .
Firstly , tyre standards are not the only problem .
In many cases a better solution is to change the road surface and not the tyre standards .
I suggest to him that they are premature and I would ask the Commission to reject them .
Mr President , Commissioner , my thanks go to Mr de Roo for the work he has done .
The reduction of any kind of noise is important both for people ' s health and their comfort .
The consumer is always the one that has to pay .
It is not really just black and round , as the layman thinks .
On the other hand , a narrow tyre works well on snow .
I want my fellowmen to drive on safe tyres , above all .
Now , at the second reading , 4 amendments have been tabled .
Amendment Nos 2 , 3 and 4 propose the reduction of noise thresholds by 2 decibels .
Until grip requirements are applied , these three amendments are therefore unacceptable .
Unfortunately , however , the proposed timetable is too strict .
The wide range of products covered and the problem in all its complexity must be considered .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Dangerous substances and preparations ( azocolourants )
The reason for the restriction is that there is good cause to believe that these substances are carcinogenic .
The amendments , which were adopted unanimously , therefore represent an improvement .
I should like to refer to just two of them .
It should be a complete , closed , precise list of named products .
That is the purpose of Amendment No 3 .
I think this proposal is sensible and propose that it be accepted .
However , the substance which Mr Ferrer proposes is already included in the annex .
The amendments to this report were tabled by myself .
I just want to straighten that out because Mrs Roth-Behrendt ' s name was mentioned .
That is the purpose of my amendments , to which a large majority of the committee agreed .
Moreover , the general description of the area of application that has been given is too vague .
We want an exhaustive , clearly defined list for the purpose of creating clarity and legal certainty .
The test methods to be used to show compliance with the provisions are specified in the proposed directive .
The proposal provides not only for the protection of consumers ' and workers ' health .
It also addresses an internal market issue .
The proposed directive would harmonise the rules of Member States .
It also takes account of the opinion of the competent Scientific Committee on Risks .
I believe it is a proportionate measure .
Amendments Nos. 3 , 4 and 7 of the Committee on the Environment are the ones I refer to .
The Commission feels this could not be justified on the basis of the current knowledge about the risks .
This applies to Amendment No 5 of the Committee on the Environment .
However , the Commission can accept that when available a more reliable standardised testing method could be introduced .
However , the Commission cannot accept that the exemption is only temporary .
To summarise our point of view , we can accept Amendment No 1 of the Committee on the Environment .
However , the Commission can in principle support parts of Amendment No 3 .
We wish to carry on the dialogue with Parliament .
I am convinced that we can reach a constructive solution .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
What is the heart of the problem ?
Major economic and socio-political damage is being caused in the Member States through work not being declared .
Health insurances , pensions systems and the Treasury together lose billions every year .
Workers are in no way insured or otherwise safeguarded .
The sector as a whole is growing three times as fast as the official economy .
Almost all investigations list unduly high taxes and social security contributions as a cause .
The problem is complex and needs to be tackled at a variety of levels .
This needs to be revised in the latest text we have before us .
Many thanks for your attention .
But the overall thrust of the report is very good .
But it also addresses this problem of undeclared work .
I should like to make one further suggestion .
This is perverse and it is in all our interests to address the problem .
Reducing tax and red tape would be a splendid start .
In this way , I now come to a core demand of this really excellent report by Mrs Glase .
I would say to my fellow MEPs in the conservative camp that things are really not that simple .
Let us take Austria and Italy , for example .
High taxes and social charges are therefore only one reason among many . Or look at Scandinavia .
Undeclared work must no longer remain a mere peccadillo .
This would-be panacea does not in fact work .
The Thatcher era in Britain taught us that .
On the contrary , the majority of those who engage in undeclared work are our own citizens .
In the same way , companies need to be jointly and severally liable towards their sub-contractors .
So we are faced with a real , substantial difficulty to overcome .
This is not true !
Lastly , the issue of illegal work also concerns children under 15 years old !
Far from stigmatising these victims , we should be concerning ourselves with a specific type of employer criminality .
What should we do ?
Mr President , there are different types of undeclared work .
It can be difficult drawing the line between undeclared and properly declared work .
The serious cases of undeclared work are those that are organised as such .
That is the heart of the matter .
In many quarters , organised undeclared work is well-known , both among the local population and the authorities .
There is also a tax argument which plays a big part in Mrs Glase ' s thinking .
This subject has already been taken up in the debate .
It is precisely because this is such a crucial issue that I should like to make two comments .
That is a mistake which I would ask the Commission to take into account .
Then there is the matter of bogus self-employment and certain new forms of employment .
All these problems require innovative solutions ; bans are not enough .
Mr President , the good news is that Europe has not run out of work .
The bad news is that , more and more often , work goes undeclared .
Failing to declare work is no mere peccadillo .
Jobs cannot be safeguarded in this way . Nor can new ones be created .
What is to be done ?
Those who hire workers who do not have work permits should be excluded from being awarded public contracts .
Moreover , they should expect to receive custodial sentences .
Secondly , thorough checks , including cross-border checks , by the relevant authorities are necessary .
Thirdly , incentives to abuse the system must be reduced .
It is extremely damaging both socially and economically .
Acting illegally is anti-social .
I should like to thank Mrs Glase for her excellent report .
The Commission has opened the debate with its communication on undeclared work in the spring of 1998 .
The time has come to bring together the fruits of this debate .
Therefore I especially welcome Parliament 's initiative in taking up this issue now .
I am pleased to see that Parliament has agreed with the Commission 's analysis .
We believe that undeclared work should be actively taken into account in the national action plans for employment .
We are working with the Member States to ensure that this is so .
We welcome Parliament 's support in this .
This we have done with the Communication in 1998 and we will continue to do so .
We must not forget that undeclared work is a deeply rooted phenomenon .
Changes take time .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m. )
Would you please ensure that the Council fulfils its obligations in this area as well ?
Thank you , Mr Rübig .
Your request and your comment will be dealt with appropriately .
Mr President , on a point of order .
Mr President , the honourable Member 's request concerns a matter of importance .
The President has very clearly ruled out the possibility of a debate this morning .
Thank you very much , Commissioner , for making yourself available .
The next item is the joint debate on :
the Council statement on doping in sport and sport in society ;
the Commission statement on football player transfers ;
The champions who are preparing to enter this field of dreams have their own schedules .
Elite sport , be it amateur or professional , receives global media coverage today .
Sport has permeated the whole of society .
Far be it for me to demonise the economic aspect of sport .
Sport needs resources , and the public purse cannot provide all the necessary funding .
Who has not witnessed the sale and purchase of sportsmen , some of whom are still very young ?
Who has not been alarmed at the sight of increasingly overcrowded sporting calendars ?
What kind of sport do we want for the twenty-first century ?
The reply to this all-embracing , fundamental question depends on our response to the present situation .
Sport forms a whole .
We need cohesion throughout the Union .
I am delighted that this is emphasised in the report prepared by Mr Mennea and adopted by the Commission .
The first question concerns the protection of under-age sportspeople .
We must be able to put an end to commercial transactions involving minors .
Identifying the specific features of sport is an enormously complex undertaking .
Significant progress in this direction is a matter of urgency .
I believe we are caught up in a race against the clock .
France has decided to make this a priority of its presidency .
I have great faith in the contribution that will come from your Parliament .
Let me turn now to the fight against doping , which is an absolute priority issue .
I am also aware that the European Parliament shares this concern , as your reports and resolutions show .
Recent events show that we still have a long way to go .
The World Anti-Doping Agency that has now been created owes its existence to the will of the European Union .
I , for my part , believe that we have the legal basis for participation .
Doping is unquestionably a matter of public health .
One need only consider the increase in the consumption of performance-enhancing drugs by young amateur sportspeople .
It also has to do with the fight against trafficking and , thus , with police and customs cooperation .
Lastly , the struggle against doping also relates to the development of research .
The credibility of the anti-doping effort depends on it .
Ladies and gentlemen , European sport is at the crossroads .
But the greed that it arouses and the threat that emanates from such greed must be taken seriously .
I have naturally taken note of Mrs Buffet 's statements .
For the moment I shall confine myself to a statement on the transfer issue .
The approach that the Commission has adopted with regard to sport is defined in its Helsinki report .
We want sport to have a social function .
The Commission is investigating only those aspects of sport with a Community dimension and an economic dimension .
The Commission believes that the FIFA rules on transfers unfairly obstruct freedom of movement .
The present system , however , satisfies neither of these criteria .
Mario Monti and I have established contacts with the footballing world .
For a number of years , and until a few days ago , we had received no reply .
Mario Monti and I are pleased to learn that our plea seems to have been heeded this time .
We have , however , received an initial outline of the proposals .
This afternoon I shall be meeting with FIFA officials and a delegation from the national leagues .
They too will be making proposals .
I believe you will reaffirm this by adopting the parliamentary report devoted to the Helsinki report .
So , if I am not mistaken , we are all on the same wavelength .
Logically , this is more common in sports with greater financial resources .
Combating intentional or planned doping is much more difficult .
Overall , we need to fight doping globally .
Combating accidental doping is much easier .
For this purpose , we ask for the intervention of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency .
Finally , I will mention penalties .
Moreover , all sports-related economic activities must be subject to the rules of the EC Treaty .
This has got nothing to do with Heads of State and Government at all .
It is the European Commission that is responsible for ensuring that the Treaties are respected .
And the Commission is exercising precisely that remit .
Mr President , sport is a popular activity .
This is , of course , extremely important in a society which increasingly focuses on the individual .
The PPE-DE is entirely behind this objective and has tabled amendments to give this initiative a boost .
I welcome the statement made by the Commissioner , which has our support .
It would be better if they came to Parliament first and had our support .
The subject of transfers is perhaps an example that sums up the current situation of sport .
There are two reports , the Zabell report and the Mennea report , drawn up by Olympic champions .
We are dealing with uncontrolled , unsustainable long-term speculation .
If we were applying the rules of economics , we would have to act differently .
Therefore , I think that the Commission should act .
It has managed to make FIFA begin to see sense .
But Hollywood did not go under . Quite the opposite .
Therefore , keep going , Commissioner .
Linford Christie has campaigned throughout his career against doping in sport .
He would not do anything now to jeopardise that .
It has never been clear what social significance we should attribute to it .
Let me turn to the facts now .
And the systematic doping that this commercialisation encourages is simply intensifying this process.Those are the facts of the matter .
This pyramid must be respected in a number of ways .
There is the system , and then there is the individual too .
There is the training of sportspeople .
But what happens to the individual outside the arena ?
They must be able to move freely in Europe , but they are not products . They are individuals .
So what happens when the competition is over ?
It is primarily a form of cheating , with individuals cheating themselves as well as cheating others .
Professional sport has undoubtedly become a business in its own right , subject to the dictates of profitability .
Some football clubs are already listed on the stock market .
How can the sporting ethic be restored ?
First of all , the fight against doping must be globalised .
Let us hope that it remains independent and that it will become operational very soon .
It is our job to give it the tools it needs to accomplish its mission .
Doping is not only a European problem ; it is indubitably a problem of global dimensions .
As far as regulation is concerned , it is not up to Europe to make the rules .
The latest transfer record , set when Figo moved to Real Madrid , is a case in point .
Clubs in certain countries now build their teams almost exclusively with foreign players .
The plundering of young players from the clubs that have developed their skills is another consequence .
The cure is worse than the disease .
We all recognise nowadays that sport is big business .
Other sports have a lot of money sloshing around .
Formula 1 is a good example .
In , the UK they even had a million pounds to spare for the Labour Party .
Sport has a lot of money and it cannot expect to be exempt from free market rules .
I endorse the Commissioner 's remarks this morning .
I would , however , say that there is no rush .
It is something that needs to be sorted out so that the people of Europe will understand .
Europe needs friends , not enemies .
Let us not add football spectators to those people who do not understand what Europe is about .
We are all living longer , and sport is occupying a greater part of our time .
Sport has a huge potential .
It has shown that it can build understanding and fight racism .
Let us do more work in sport to bring our communities together .
It has shown that it has the power to encourage disabled athletes to succeed .
Let us show that we share their pride and build joint events for them and able-bodied people .
Violence on the field has been the bad side of sport .
Let us work to ensure that sport is violence-free .
Doping , finally , is a symptom of the over-commercialisation of sport .
As our teams head off to Sydney they are under more pressure than ever .
Sport fulfils a major social role in our society ; that much is clear .
Professional sport fulfils this role too and has great social significance .
I would like to know whether you have a response to this .
I think we are at a turning point .
If FIFA had done its job , the Commission would not have needed to get involved in this .
So I think that everyone has a job to do here .
That report also called for the Commission to declare a European Year of Sport .
I wish it every luck .
The reports we have before us also provide a basis for debate .
We need to create legal bases to stem these negative trends .
I welcome this proposal with open arms .
But holding on to the current system would not solve the problem either .
A more structural solution would be if the media millions were better distributed .
I would like to say the following on the transfer system .
Up to 2500 drug tests will be carried out during the Sydney games .
The way to stop the use of drugs in sport should be coordinated on a worldwide basis .
Our 700 000 sports clubs are pillars of Europe 's civil society .
The Council Presidency has said that sport is education for life .
Let me stress that I am saying a part .
To reduce sport to an economic and competitive level is to deny its wider social significance .
The importance of sport was also mentioned in the conclusions of the Feira Summit .
But does everyone see and recognise the different purposes of participation in sport ?
For some , it may be a question of keeping fit .
Not every human act can be priced with a pocket calculator .
The effect of that approach on human relations is too dangerous for us to remain silent .
We cannot accept this excessive striving for profits to the detriment of human development .
The protection of young sportspeople is a priority of the French Presidency .
It is our priority , and we must demand the prohibition of commercial transactions relating to these young people .
It is certainly a challenge , but we must accept it for the sake of coming generations .
In both cases , one very much relies on the other .
Therefore , this report does not mark the end of the game , quite the reverse .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , action has to be taken in three directions .
First and foremost , we must wage a relentless fight against doping .
The most important thing is that governments should arm themselves with proper structures to combat doping .
We must also combat the excesses of the transfer system , especially the trade in young professional sportsmen .
Finally , we must strengthen the real driving forces of sport , namely the federations and sport at school .
Young people must be the main target in the rehabilitation of sport .
Is humanity regressing towards the decadence of ancient Rome ?
The time has come for politicians and sporting authorities to exercise their responsibility .
Doping is a scourge from which sport has to protect itself .
Mrs Buffet has been tackling this issue in France , and I congratulate her for it .
The European Union must also rise to the challenge of the modernisation of sport .
The system of agents must be brought under control by the Union , or perhaps even scrapped .
Mr President , sport has become a magnificent form of international entertainment .
It is a source of inspiration for millions and huge sums of money are involved in it .
Exercise is educationally important and vital for health .
Sports societies bring people together to do self-sacrificing voluntary work .
As we shape sports policy we have to take account of sport ' s various structures .
It is incomprehensible why sport lacks a legal base in the European Union .
The ethical problems associated with the latter are known to all .
Sportswomen and sportsmen are citizens of our countries .
I believe that this is extremely important .
On the question of transfers , allow me to give my position and the position of the French Presidency .
So there is the possibility of innovative proposals in this domain .
Allow me to congratulate the two rapporteurs , Mrs Zabell and Mr Mennea , for their important contributions .
The views of the Commission and Parliament coincide , and they coincide with those of the public too .
I shall start with a few words on the Community support plan to combat doping in sport .
Doping in sport is not simply an ethical problem .
Let us move on to the World Anti-Doping Agency .
We are expected to play a leading role , and we are prepared to do so .
Lastly , the Commission has to mobilise the resources at its disposal for the fight against doping .
It is essential , for instance , to ensure maximum coordination of policies and regulatory measures .
The adoption of a recommendation on sport and doping is also planned for this autumn .
The sum of EUR 5 million has been allocated .
There will be three levels of action : the world of sport , national decision-makers and the Community .
The world of sport comes first .
It must be perfectly clear , however , that a blanket exemption from these rules can never be warranted .
Moreover , we are banking on transparency and dialogue .
The second level is that of the national authorities .
( Applause )
Can we pursue effective common policies without taking account of the role of the grass-roots sports organisations ?
I do not think so .
And I am convinced that we must make a special effort to protect young athletes more effectively .
This brings me to a final comment , Mr President , one that is important for the future .
At the same time , though , we must keep our feet on the ground .
There is no miracle cure .
First we must consider how useful these references could be and what we want to do .
I will tell you my personal views .
I am not in favour of a protocol that would exempt the federations from the major Community principles .
That is not our aim .
I have listened carefully to your messages today .
You keep coming back to that idea , emphasising it , and I quite agree with you .
I intend to submit a communication to the Commission on proclaiming the year 2004 the European Year of Sport .
( Applause )
Why 2004 ?
Let us , too , surpass ourselves in our endeavours to boost European sport .
( Applause )
Thank you Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
( The house rose and observed a minute 's silence )
This has unfortunately become clear in recent weeks .
It is perfectly appropriate to make her an apology in writing .
That time-limit is equivalent to authorising undertakings to discharge their toxic substances for another 20 years .
That is why we abstained .
Although I support the report , I wish to make known certain reservations pertaining to same .
Water pricing was always going to be a sensitive aspect to this Directive .
Water pricing policy is also a taxation issue .
The framework directive on water has finally been adopted - very welcome news .
After nearly four years , these rationalisation attempts have finally borne fruit .
Our Parliament could not have endorsed a text which was nothing more than a statement of intent .
The PPE / DE Group has always taken an ambitious and realistic stance .
That is real progress .
Water is a vulnerable and invaluable natural resource .
For all these reasons , I voted for this text .
That kind of project complies with the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity that we have always upheld .
Trying to incorporate piecemeal water policies in one framework directive represents a considerable challenge .
The European Union now also needs to consider water pricing .
Florenz report ( A5-0212 / 2000 )
Up to 75 % of all metallic components in new vehicles can be recycled as metal scrap .
This process should and must continue in an effort to promote higher environmental standards .
This directive aims to increase the scope for vehicle recycling and to encourage the re-use of car components .
We must all ensure that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars at the design stage .
We conservatives seldom vote against conciliations .
Retroactive legislation affects competition and is unacceptable from a legal point of view .
The negotiations came up against stumbling blocks on several points .
The difficulties focused on producer liability and the treatment of heavy metals .
After several hours of conciliation , the negotiators managed to reach agreement .
That is a demagogic provision .
It may well be based on goodwill towards the consumer , but it is totally unrealistic .
In fact , the directive stipulates that the cost of treatment will be borne entirely by the producers .
The amendment I tabled and supported has , in fact , been fully incorporated into the final text .
In wider terms , this directive is not ambitious enough .
For example , it says nothing at all about the problem of the dumped cars that disfigure the landscape .
De Roo report ( A5-0218 / 2000 )
That is good news , because pensioners like peace and quiet .
But are we really sure that less noisy tyres are really in everyone ' s best interests ?
The Strasbourg tram is a clear illustration of this .
We only saw the economic gain and how convenient it was for the car driver , not the drawbacks .
Fortunately , over the past few years , this attitude has started to change .
This does not end the problems caused by cars and lorries .
This contrast was highlighted once again during the debate on car tyres .
The Group of the European United Left has constantly backed Mr De Roo in this .
We regret that his reasonable and self-evident proposals cannot count on the general approval they deserve .
Mankind moves , and moves other objects .
Movement creates noise .
It is our freedom that creates noise .
The states , and also industry , are working to combat this noise pollution , which can cause illness .
Global performance is estimated according to a range of often conflicting criteria that are well-known to tyre-manufacturers .
We condemn these amendments , which would lead to what I would also call a nonsense in industrial terms .
Yet again , the Union is putting the devil in the detail .
Anyway , what do we find most annoying on a day-to-day basis ?
It would be better to do some in-depth research on road surface noise and dangers .
Let us not lose our sense of priorities and , what I would term , legislative efficiency .
Bakopoulos report ( A5-0168 / 2000 )
We voted against the joint resolution on mergers in the telecommunications sector .
We reject that approach , which disregards people ' s social needs .
Human cloning :
This is a completely absurd assertion which I think ought to be withdrawn .
We must observe the precautionary principle , in this case more so than ever .
We cannot just content ourselves with this debate .
It would have been better if Europe were able to decide and not just one Head of State .
Nevertheless , we are today dealing with two conflicting points of view .
I myself endorse the latter .
This too is a question of ethics .
I am extremely pleased about the decision taken .
We must say no to the cloning of human beings .
Human beings are subjects , not objects .
I have to say that I think their behaviour here has been shameful .
This smacks of contradiction .
It is shameful , to say the least , to ditch all your principles out of loyalty to Blair .
The matter is a controversial one and depends very much on one ' s chosen perspective .
Does our purpose matter in the end , if the deed is the same ?
For that reason , discrimination such as this cannot be approved without the proper kind of thorough discussion .
So the intention cannot be said to be a bad one .
Do we have the right to create in this way categories of sub-humans that can be manipulated at will ?
Quite obviously , I think not .
All cloning is by definition reproductive .
We would be entering a different society , one contrary to our values .
That kind of procedure would be acceptable , since it is comparable to organ donation .
At any rate , we hope so .
This issue is all the more sensitive when it concerns human beings and genetic foundations .
We must , therefore , be extremely cautious , without going so far as to be obscurantist .
As they stand at present , I do not like any of the resolutions submitted by the groups .
The Socialist Group is not calling strongly enough for an immediate stop to all human cloning .
The urgent nature of the subject should have demanded an effective approach :
an immediate and absolute moratorium ;
in-depth reflection and a very wide-ranging basic debate prior to a directive laying down the rules to be adopted .
That is not the case with the resolutions put to the vote today .
I will therefore abstain on these motions for resolution .
This raises a great many , closely related , problems .
Does the recognition of life depend on whether it is planned ?
Lucas report ( A5-0187 / 2000 )
Nor are there enough practical measures to encourage aviation to pay more respect to the environment .
That is the exercise on which the European Parliament has embarked .
Its report tackles several of the problems caused by air transport .
People who live close to airports are particularly affected by the noise of night flights .
The ICAO has initiated a process of revising noise levels .
Then there is the problem of gas emissions .
The list of pollutants from air transport is a long one .
This alarming fact should encourage us to take measures very quickly .
This has created two holy cows : the car and the aircraft .
Aviation and airports have now become a privileged sector .
They are largely exempt from taxes and environmental rules .
- ( SV ) We abstained from voting in the final vote on Mrs Lucas ' report .
We are firm opponents of these proposals .
The Commission proposal is mainly money-driven .
Zabell report ( A5-0203 / 2000 )
Mr President , this report refers to the fight against doping in sport .
Unfortunately , the international sporting authorities have not been able to halt or even combat this extremely serious scourge .
How can so many countries be persuaded to agree ?
. ( NL ) Playing sports is good for us .
After all , playing is in our make-up and benefits our health and sense of well-being .
As a result , the discrepancy between amateur and professional sport has become far too pronounced .
Sport is high on the agenda in the Commission ' s Helsinki report .
It is regrettable that many major sports events show signs of the opposite .
The focus on performance and commercial interests should disappear very much into the background .
Accordingly , the involvement of the Community in fighting the use of doping should be low-key .
Doping in sport runs totally counter to that ideal .
It is also a form of cheating that is contrary to the sporting ethic .
I will , of course , take part in it and give my views .
I think it is also vital to launch information campaigns on the risks associated with doping products .
I am glad to say that the French Presidency has undertaken to improve the way it operates .
Let us restore the true value of sport .
We are voting against recitals I , J and K and are abstaining from voting on paragraph 2 .
Sports policy is an area in which the Commission clearly ought not to have powers .
We are abstaining from voting in the final vote .
I hope that this report will lead to the introduction of subsidised sporting events for the elderly .
Mr Mennea would certainly win another Olympic medal if we held events on the basis of age .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Members who voted for my report .
Let us unite behind this idea .
Let these issues be handled at national level and by the sporting community itself .
A word was even coined for this new version of ' bread and circus ' .
It is ' tittytainment ' , formed from the American slang for breasts and the word entertainment .
That concludes the explanations of vote .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.36 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
I hope that this will meet your concerns .
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
( The Minutes were approved )
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
Nuclear submarine accidents
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
Their names are no secret .
Not only do they deserve our respect , but also all the European support we can provide .
And that for as long as we can remember .
At least , that has been the plan for years .
Why has nothing been done about it ? The answer is simple .
This is a striking example of Russia ' s official stance in urgent matters of nuclear safety .
The nuclear scandal in Moscow , which dates back to 1995 , is also salient in this respect .
The neighbourhood was tipped off in time and the whole plan was called off .
In fact , the reactor was closed down .
And how did the director Jevgeni Adamov fare ?
May this serve as a warning to Europe .
Needless to say , Russia must exercise complete openness and cooperate fully .
Russia is also financially responsible .
They deserve our solidarity .
Facts were suppressed , falsified or hushed up .
We have to see the reality for what it is .
But that is not a satisfactory state of affairs .
That is why they need not only our help , but also frank talking .
So we have an enormous responsibility here .
We know that it is not impossible that more people will yet be affected by this accident .
There can only be one response to this accident , and that response is ' disarmament now ' .
The docks in Gibraltar are type ' Z ' .
This is at the heart of our resolution .
It is , in fact , downright impudent .
We will need to be involved in these operations , partly on humanitarian grounds .
This is what our resolution is about .
Obviously , we believe that the European Union has sufficient arguments to ensure such cooperation .
We think that there is a need to take urgent action .
In this case , there has been a violation of Community law .
The Commission considers that the international community should offer the necessary assistance to Russia .
It has already launched a number of assistance projects under various Community programmes .
It has been raised by five Members in this House and he has not said anything about it .
I am concerned : is it that he is deaf ?
Is it that he does not know what to do ?
I find that quite natural .
I will be suggesting to my colleagues that we answer your questions in writing .
Mr President , the subject for today is ' Nuclear submarine accidents ' .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today , at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
Mr President , why do so many Africans struggle when it comes to sharing power ?
If , on top of this , the fittest constitute the minority , then conflicts are bound to ensue .
Only national reconciliation can offer some hope and this is certainly true of Burundi .
Following Mandela ' s remarkable efforts , peace seemed to be on its way at last .
Unfortunately , the fighting has not stopped and some parties have refused to sign the peace accord .
Every effort must be made in order to ensure that the new negotiations are a success .
Only if Africans are willing to share power does this continent have a future .
But the accord is not perfect .
Indeed , there is still no cease-fire and the fights around the capital of Bujumbura simply continue .
It is regrettable that the accord does not look beyond the regional context .
But this does not take away the fact that this risk in Burundi is real .
Mr President , I fully subscribe to the entreaties of Mr Van den Bos and Mr Van Hecke .
A second point is the contentious resumption of aid .
This has been a problem in the long process on many occasions .
Two Tutsi parties added their signature to the agreement on the following day .
Cease-fire talks are organised for 20 September in Nairobi .
The regional presidents Moi and Thabo Mbeki stress their importance .
We are organised to step up the actual cooperation .
This is a very focused effort , trying to do things right .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today , at 5.30 p.m.
There have been 17 000 children born in those camps over the last ten years .
That is what we are doing here today .
The refugees have been waiting for the last ten years for an amicable and permanent solution to the crisis .
As Ms McCarthy has said - very many of them want to go home .
There have been numerous bilateral talks but so far a final political settlement has not been secured .
This would be a fitting way to mark the UN 's Millennium Summit .
I hope they will be given every encouragement to do so .
One of the crucial issues to be decided is the definition of the family unit for verification purposes .
That agreement regrettably is still outstanding .
That is not much .
That , ladies and gentlemen , is the report you adopted .
It does not mean the communitisation , even in part , of our common foreign and security policy .
Is that really impossible ?
Is it beyond your powers of imagination ?
That is the question I wanted to ask you .
It is high time that substantial agreements were reached .
Bhutan and Nepal are not neighbours , but they are close to each other in spirit .
Both are aware that lasting conflict will paralyse their national and economic progress .
Bhutan criticises Nepal on the grounds that its constant changes of government make it incapable of action .
That has changed .
I hope that will change .
There is agreement on the four categories of people living in the refugee camps .
Nepal has already agreed .
We are also appealing to India to stop primly holding back .
It is linked with both neighbours through agreements and economic ties .
There are 6 million Nepalese working in India .
The borders are open , and there are no asylum problems .
Some movement is discernible .
The text on Burma , unfortunately the umpteenth one , is very good .
That is the situation .
So I think we should ask ourselves a few questions .
Our policy towards Asia is a criminal policy ; it is quite literally criminal .
Unfortunately that is not the case .
The European Parliament has been calling for this for a long time and we must continue to urge it .
We are informed by many sources that there are dozens of Chinese military bases in Burma .
You are aware of the situation in Pakistan .
All these people are in an unacceptable situation .
The national economy stays afloat thanks to drugs .
In my opinion , the European Union and the United States should agree on a strategy against Burma .
People elsewhere have commented : look at Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi .
And what happens ?
The international community looks on and does nothing .
Mr President , I should like to support what the other speakers have said .
Burma has done nothing since being readmitted to Asean to show that it deserves it .
There should be a serious rethink of this policy .
Burma should be excluded .
I also believe that the European Union could do a lot more .
Aung San Suu Kyi has asked for sanctions but we have done absolutely nothing about this .
Even the United States has at least halted new investment .
Why is the European Union not ensuring that sanctions are imposed ?
As the resolution says , we should discourage any kind of tourism to Burma .
That should be supported .
His mother is currently travelling to Burma hoping to see him .
The charges against him were trumped up .
We will continue to concern ourselves with that situation .
We are certainly still pinning our hopes in San Suu Kyi .
Violations of human rights in Colombia , particularly the case of Fr . Brendan Forde
Mr President , this Parliament has discussed the situation in Colombia many times .
In that situation , there are various groups who use violence .
At times , even military units use violence and violate human rights .
There is really not very much this Parliament can do .
He is so isolated he probably will never hear of the debate here today .
He has to go eight miles before he can find a telephone to communicate with anybody .
There was no consultation on Plan Colombia with the Colombian people , which is unacceptable .
I believe that this should have been part of the resolution .
Father Forde is staying where he is because he is trying to protect his community .
So what can we do ?
Indeed , the paramilitary groups are crushing the civilian population in a lethal vice .
However , the last time a human rights defender was assassinated in Colombia was in May .
His name was Ramiro Zapata .
I think that this is a catastrophe for Colombia .
I am totally committed to the defence of human rights . "
The reality that is currently devastating the country is quite different , Mr President .
How does the Commission intend to respond , to show solidarity with the conflict that is devastating the country ?
British soldiers held hostage in Sierra Leone
Mr President , unfortunately , kidnappings in Sierra Leone are once again in the news .
This time it is the kidnapping of eleven British soldiers by the West Side Boys militia .
It is still a precarious peace , which is demonstrated by this kidnapping .
Without peace , development will only be a Utopia .
The victims of the kidnapping undoubtedly have a great deal of political significance .
Turkish bombing in the north of Iraq
Mr President , this is a truly distressing affair .
Commissioner , I think we should be quite plain about this .
If this respect is not forthcoming , it will be a continual source of misery .
War will never lead to peace .
This is a bloodbath and a crime against humanity .
Is it really possible to accelerate the democratisation process using weapons and arms ?
Why is that mothers always have to suffer ?
Bombing civilian populations should no longer be allowed in this century .
I wish to condemn this inhumanity and want to see an end to this crime .
That is the fast track into the EU .
I will not go back over that but I do want to give my opinion here .
Disproportionate reprisals of that kind should be banished forever from the military arsenal of a civilised country .
Otherwise , it is not acceptable for it to become a part of this Union .
Above all , arrangements should be agreed for those who wish to go back to Bhutan voluntarily .
Technical solutions cannot be found unless the negotiators are firmly resolved to reach agreement .
I have also talked to government representatives from both parties .
They also seem determined to find a solution .
The Commission has used every opportunity to urge both sides to achieve tangible results .
A number of EU Member States have made the same commitment .
It is our responsibility to prevent it .
Several speakers this afternoon have mentioned tourism .
We encourage our citizens to respond accordingly .
Nor can such treatment be justified by unsubstantiated allegations of conspiracy .
This was a simple exercise in thuggery by an administration acting in panic .
Impunity for the perpetrators of such atrocities has almost been systematic .
The Commission also supports the peace efforts promoted by President Pastrana .
We hope the ongoing efforts to secure the release of the remaining six soldiers are successful .
We would like to express our solidarity with the soldiers and their families .
They have suffered enough .
I will be happy to augment what I am saying now by more thorough comments in writing .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 5.30 p.m.
Temelín nuclear power station
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution :
That is the assurance , or reassurance , that the public in the European Union requires .
We have had many messages from the Czech authorities this week .
That is what the Espoo Convention stipulates , and it is , after all , valid EU legislation .
Please just think about Chernobyl .
In the course of 13 project modifications , environmental impact assessment has been simply disregarded .
As Mrs Flemming said , it is a long time since the Espoo Convention was signed .
The Commission says that we do not have any legal options here .
Well , the Commission has known that for a long time .
Double standards are being applied here , and that must stop .
I cannot vote for this policy .
Mr President , this issue should not even be a subject of urgent debate .
I therefore fully support the motion for a resolution before us and oppose the amendment .
I should therefore quickly like to say three things .
We must broaden out this debate , which is part and parcel of our democracy .
And , above all , there are no uniform safety standards for nuclear power stations .
There is an urgent need for action here if our credibility is to be maintained .
Edmund Stoiber was quite right when he said today that it is a matter of following the house rules .
After all , it must be our objective for nuclear power stations to have the highest possible safety standards .
Mr President , I shall also be voting for this resolution , which I consider to be reasonable .
That is not the way we have handled these things in the European Union up to now .
And then some other group will come along demanding something else .
You have to be careful with ultimatums like this .
There are other ways of solving such problems .
My last , but important point , is one for the Commission .
Mr President , Mr Linkohr 's comments are not quite correct .
I will gladly let you see the text approved by the Austrian Parliament .
The Commission has been following the political debate on the Temelín nuclear power plant with great attention .
The responsibility for licensing nuclear installations lies with the Czech nuclear regulatory authority .
The Commission has cooperated with the Czech authorities in order to reinforce the authority 's capacities .
The Commission expects this provision to be enforced by the Czech authorities .
Mr Adams asks whether the Czechs took account of the IAEA 's inspections and views .
The answer is ' yes ' .
The IAEA concluded that the issues were properly addressed by the Czechs .
That is the information I am able to supply on this subject .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place in a few minutes ' time , at 5.30 p.m.
Fires in Europe
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution :
Climatic changes , which are happening more and more rapidly , impact on the entire ecosystem .
Southern Europe has been set alight more and more frequently over recent years .
The Mediterranean has become a high risk area and needs special measures .
So what proposals can we make ?
They could use the Interreg Community initiative , for example .
So this summer epidemic is curable , Mr President .
The citizens concerned are counting on the Commission to take practical action .
What it has proved is that reaction is not enough .
We need to be pro-active .
That is what we all say , but none of us does anything .
What can the European Union do ?
The principle of subsidiarity has been mentioned in this debate .
We have to avoid raising too many expectations and overloading the Commission with tasks .
We must be careful not to promise things we cannot deliver .
Frankly , there has been enough of that in the past .
We can and should do something , but I wanted to make that cautionary remark .
New Commission initiatives are already in effect , or will shortly become effective .
This will aim to improve the mutual assistance between Member States .
The Commission is also encouraging Member States to reinforce their intervention capacities .
The Regional Fund and the Cohesion Fund have already contributed substantially in the period 1994-99 .
The national authorities should provide for the necessary financial resources to consolidate this action for the period 2000-06 .
Self-tuition workshops on fighting forest fires are also planned .
However the Commission does not have enough resources to extend its activities beyond that .
It is obviously too late to table an urgent resolution on this issue .
Thank you very much , Mr Morillon , we will pass on that request .
Mr President , I would like to support Mr Morillon 's suggestion .
I will gladly do that , Mr Sakellariou
Mr President , this shows the folly of making policy on the hoof .
This has never gone through any committee .
I got the message very well , Mr Wynn .
Situation in Fiji following the coup d 'état
Commissioner Nielson has the floor .
However , there are still serious worries about the future of Fiji .
Secondly , a democratic government must be re-established .
The present interim government has no democratic basis .
There should be a clear blue-print for full restoration of democratic principles and practices .
The time-frame currently being proposed , two or three years , is far too long .
The fundamental ethnic antagonism in Fiji must be resolved .
Multiracial cooperation and harmony must become a reality .
This might require international mediation .
The international community and the donors of aid to Fiji agree on these principles .
We are now at the beginning of the consultations .
Poverty-related projects should , consequently , continue .
This is absolutely essential and there are no alternatives to that reality .
But the Fiji story is more complicated than that .
The army plays a dubious role .
Tourism , which represented one third of the gross domestic product , has dropped to less than one fifth .
Ethnic tension is once again mounting .
Speight should not be let off the hook .
A three-year transitional period is not acceptable .
Consultations on this matter will be starting in September .
Secondly , I disagree that there is a fundamental ethnic antagonism in Fiji .
I welcome the fact that Article 366 of the Lomé Convention has been invoked .
The police and the military singularly failed to protect and defend the government .
In fact , it is another Chile written small .
Second , Fiji should be banned from all international sporting and cultural events .
Some of our motions for resolution also include the requirement that the opposition should take part in the government .
How can we translate this role into effective peace mediation ?
Could we not appoint a genuine mediator or mediating body in consultation with the UN and the Commonwealth ?
These procedures should be applied with due care , intelligence and maturity .
Indeed , European colonialism brought peoples of very different origins together in those regions too .
In these countries , there have often been harsh clashes between these peoples .
That is the key difference compared with the current states in Europe .
Fair enough , Europe is to blame and should help solve the problems .
But that does not take away the fact that the situation which has arisen in Fiji is completely unacceptable .
The equal rights of the large Indian minority , the constitution and parliamentary democracy must be restored .
I have friends and acquaintances there and have been there .
I should like clarification from you , Commissioner .
I would like clarity on that point .
Mr Ford has called for Fiji to be banned from all sporting events .
Fiji will have a squad there as part of the World Cup .
The Australian Government wants them banned .
The Australian Government thinks that Fiji should not take part in this competition .
Sport today is not only sport , it is also business .
We have no specific view in the Commission as to one event or another .
It is not just a donor-recipient relationship .
The options are open .
We have both the stick and the carrot .
But it is an extremely critical situation .
It contains all the dilemmas that situations like this normally present .
This is also the reply to Mrs Maes .
I can fully concur with everything Mr Ford said .
It is really tragic what is happening .
So , in political terms we have already sent a strong message .
Would the Commissioner accept that is a suitable target and a suitable deadline ?
I am not sure that particular date is meaningful .
I would not like to dictate a date just like that .
I would not be willing to accept a specific date at this stage .
There is a tactical necessity not to create the problem .
The debate is closed .
The vote on these motions for resolutions will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
( The sitting was closed at 6.40 p.m. )
I suggest we observe a minute ' s silence in his memory .
( The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence )
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
It does not actually say that such a temporary committee should be set up .
Could we have some guidance as to what the presidency will do about this particular section of the resolution ?
Mr Bowis , that will be duly corrected and amended .
That will be the course of action , Mr Ford .
( The Minutes were approved )
European Year of Lifelong Learning ( 1996 )
The Member States keen to participate quadrupled their budgets .
It is clear that we need much more clarity over training .
So , we are asking for the educational objectives to be clearly distinguished and regulated .
We have therefore requested clarity and better organisation of the system as a whole .
We have also requested greater lifelong learning and retraining for teachers .
From our point of view , this is a key issue .
People must be prepared for this vertiginous and fascinating roller coaster of change .
Things have changed radically .
Learning has become broader and longer .
New methods and sources for acquiring knowledge and training have appeared .
This warning should give us food for thought .
Even more importantly , these words have also become part of everyday language .
It is therefore a good cause .
For these reasons , this initiative was valuable , timely and fruitful .
The line between people ' s first educational experiences and later opportunities has now been crossed .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Syllabuses , or the means by which learning has so far been imparted , must be fundamentally altered .
Instead , the direction taken should be an individual one , but with social components .
Lifelong learning begins , then , with the reform of our schooling .
The individual must learn for him or herself .
A Europe of people like that would be my ideal .
The number of opportunities can surely be counted in a shorter space of time than this .
The rapporteur has justifiably emphasised this .
Electronic programs are complicated and get more so all the time .
Those who master the language of software often do not understand the language of its content .
It is only noughts and ones anyway .
This new sort of literacy has to be taught to many adults starting at the beginning .
I must tell you , it is really fun learning a language .
I have to say that I am honestly enjoying learning French
( The President asked the speaker whether he might not like to continue his speech in French . )
( Laughter )
I believe that that is also what we need in the future : for learning to be fun .
In life , the learning pyramid is , in fact , turning .
With increasing age , you also become more aware of what it is you would like to learn .
I believe that precisely these fundamental virtues are very important for the future .
What do we need now at the level of the European Community ?
A year seems a short time for the project .
That can only come from the commitment of the people on the ground .
Those are the people we must respect and encourage and support .
We can hear that especially from this discussion .
When it comes to taking action , however , the situation is often the reverse .
Lifelong learning is a phenomenon requiring a lot of resources .
Allow me to begin by commenting on the new thinking required .
Now , it is a matter of educating people for life .
We therefore need new forms of organisation in education .
We need new educational ideas and tools .
Perhaps the greatest problem is that which many other speakers have raised , namely access to money .
Many speakers here in the Chamber have agreed about the need to set financial priorities .
Perhaps we could issue a joint statement to the Swedish Presidency on this issue .
But now to the subject in hand .
We need to put an end to this kind of spin .
I am therefore very grateful for the sound report which Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines has submitted .
This too is something we need to support by making this area a priority .
As a part of this process , there must also be educational opportunities .
Furthermore , things moved slowly when it came to using the Internet .
That naturally made it hard to implement the theme year programme .
That is a pity .
They do not mean just vital items of expenditure .
European success in global competition is built on skilled and involved people .
The facilities modern technology offers for learning can be brought within everybody ' s reach .
That opportunity must be taken .
It would be far better if we could avoid that sort of failure .
Schools have to respond by providing courses at which young people will succeed .
Success encourages further ambition .
It means satisfied , enthusiastic teenagers instead of discouraged troublemakers .
It means school-leavers with a passport to a better and more fulfilling life .
There is not one young person who cannot play his part .
We have to enable this sadly wasted potential to be mobilised and to succeed .
The debate is closed .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Explanations of vote
I should therefore like to say that today ' s vote has been very important .
I am therefore very pleased that we have adopted this report by a large majority .
I also believe , however , that we ought to set an example at European level .
This fundamental fact has fuelled debates at the European Council meetings in Lisbon and Feira .
The Commission should therefore improve the quality of its reports in future .
The implementation of such measures must be coordinated with the Socrates II and Leonardo programmes .
The entire debate on the place of universal public service in new telecommunications networks is also involved .
Thank you , Mr Alyssandrakis .
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
( The sitting was closed at 10.10 a.m. )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday , 8 September 2000 .
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Thank you , Mr Tajani .
We shall consider the best way of passing on this entirely justified protest .
Madam President , I asked for the floor to raise the same point .
I shall be very happy to do that .
These incidents are incomprehensible , and not only must they be condemned but the perpetrators severely punished .
There is a desperate need for MEPs to communicate with the electorate in a much more effective way .
I have not yet received this recommendation by the Quaestors .
Once I have received it , the Bureau will , of course , examine it very carefully indeed .
Thank you for that information and clarification .
We believe that the term " constituency weeks " was an unfortunate one .
Of course . It is a source of regret to me , too .
Madam President , I would just like to return to the problems associated with the constituency weeks .
I would ask the Bureau to reconsider this .
Madam President , a fellow honourable Member has just drawn attention to an anti-Semitic incident .
On 13 September , a homeless person was found dead .
Two skinheads have admitted to beating him up .
He had subsequently died from their kicks and punches .
This happened in Kassel .
Thank you .
Order of business
Mr President , you have just said that we will be starting at half past eleven tomorrow .
Yes , exactly .
( Parliament gave its assent )
I suggest that the two issues be examined concurrently .
I think it is really a question of equity .
Yes , I think that would be best .
I think that is the best way to respond to Mr Gollnisch .
Measures to be taken following the fuel crisis and the rise in oil prices
We cannot ignore the consequences of this rise on Europe ' s economic development .
Furthermore , the European Union ' s level of dependency currently stands at around 50 % .
We must grasp our responsibility and our destiny with both hands .
The Commission intends to fulfil these fundamental objectives and has been working on them for several months .
The European Union must maintain a united front and speak with one voice .
In fact , there are already some agreements on the table .
Any agreements between companies or abuses of dominant positions must be severely penalised .
The future Green Paper on supply will contribute to it .
However , something has to be done .
The responsibility for action clearly lies with national governments .
Short-term measures will be the hardest .
It will be difficult to get a quick result , however .
I myself am not claiming that this is the case , but we need to look into the situation .
None of this , however , is going to resolve the current situation .
The people do not therefore understand why this cannot extend to oil products .
It is true that compensatory measures are required .
Madam President , Commissioner , you made it quite plain : we remain vulnerable .
Energy is not cheap .
It is a scarce commodity .
These are facts which we all seem to have forgotten for the time being .
I believe we ought not to do this in future .
They are sound , and cover transport policy , energy policy and environmental policy .
I welcome the ideas that have been put forward here today by the Commissioner .
The end result would surely be that there would be more drug addicts than before and a greater crisis .
We should not be making these kinds of mistakes now .
We want to promote energy saving , for example , and better construction technology for homes and buildings .
We also want the European Union to have powers to manage the new energy policy .
For almost ten years , we have been trying to establish a common energy tax in the European Union .
Commission Members have come and gone , but this problem has always remained unsolved .
The first of these problems concerns our relations with the South , in the event the producer countries .
We need to establish a genuine long-term partnership between these countries and ourselves .
It was valued at USD 1.18 when it was launched .
It is now valued at only USD 0.85 .
We were promised a strong currency .
It was a lie , and now we are having to foot a much higher bill .
You really would have thought you were back in 1973 after the first oil crisis .
However , there are additional strategies open to our Member States .
In other words , the third oil crisis we are experiencing now , is here to stay .
We will still have oil , but it will not come cheap .
There are enough studies to this effect .
Even if they should prove to be wrong , now is the time to consider and analyse them .
If this was just a man-made crisis , the other oil producers could redress the balance .
Mr President , let us put this matter in perspective .
This is not as much of a crisis as the 1970s .
It is as much a taxpayer ' s crisis as an energy crisis .
Energy supply is more elastic than demand .
High taxation raises revenue , but fails to cut consumption .
That is not what the taxpayers and consumers of Europe want .
The Americans , like ourselves , are suffering an explosion in farm gate prices .
Mrs de Palacio has just emphasised that Europe is the world ' s biggest oil importer .
Given this status , it is not right that it should continue to pay for its imports in dollars .
An initiative of that kind has a chance of succeeding .
Producers know that the dollar will be certain to lose value against the euro .
A word about monetary policy .
The ECB says that imported inflation is also a form of inflation to be combated .
Such prices are unacceptable .
Bear in mind that we are not the ones that set the tax rates .
It is the Member States that have the room for manoeuvre .
This is an intolerable state of affairs for the transport sector .
They must translate into action .
( Applause from the right )
Mr President , we have been sleepwalking for decades .
British Conservatives still are but it is time to wake up .
We have two choices .
Let us lower and enforce speed limits .
We must lower our dependency on imported petroleum products .
Let us put more money in the budget , change the decision on programmes like SAVE and Altener .
We do not need a new budget heading .
These heading exist .
Let us put more money in them .
Good luck , Commissioner , when you go to Luxembourg .
Mr President , yes , Mrs Palacio , you are absolutely right - what we need is dialogue .
Yes , we must increase the financial support , and yes , we oppose cartels and monopolies .
That is all quite true .
That would lead nowhere .
OPEC and the oil producing countries will immediately move in to close this gap .
They have a political and economic hold over us .
What chance do we stand against this ?
( Heckling from Mr Jarzembowski ) Have we reduced our consumption ?
There is more road transport than there was ten years ago .
It is high time this was changed .
We need a paradigm shift where transport is concerned .
There needs to be more transport via rail and water - let us make it happen .
We need to be less dependent .
Let us pursue a common energy policy , for example .
We are still lacking such a policy .
So who is guilty of blocking it to date ?
You could do that in tandem with the Commission .
Why are gas prices linked to oil prices ?
There is no reason why they should be .
You are the obvious person to bring this about .
We can do all of these things .
We can use these opportunities .
Unfortunately , I am speaking too fast for the interpreter , and I apologise for this .
The OPEC States will watch from the sidelines , smile indulgently , and put the prices up .
( Heckling from Mr Jarzembowski )
On the other hand , 35 dollars is too high a price for us to bear .
Much of our energy is destined for this specific sector in particular .
This means coordinating the energy policy .
We must be coherent .
I repeat that we must have a minimum degree of internal coherence in our policies .
Furthermore , OPEC is prepared to act and I hope that it does so and does so well .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Secretariat for joint supervisory data protection bodies
I believe not .
We are furthermore now examining this proposal for the third pillar .
As we will see , these are different aspects of the same problem .
Independence is another basic element which is not sufficiently guaranteed in the Council ' s proposal .
Let us not fool ourselves , financial independence is essential to guaranteeing functional independence .
The introduction of new technologies , computers and telecommunications has broken down barriers and transcended borders .
In fact , there is no justification for the existence of three separate joint supervisory bodies .
The question is : can this system really guarantee effective protection ?
I do not think it can .
This is a matter of protecting the interests and rights of our citizens .
This requires us to establish appropriate mechanisms for protecting our citizens from potential abuses of these rights .
However , there are serious problems with the EUROPOL and Schengen Conventions , and as regards customs cooperation .
Yet still I cannot vote in favour of Mr Hernández Mollar ' s report .
Bringing these officials together under one roof will not guarantee better data protection .
Both EUROPOL and Schengen will add hugely to the construction of fortress Europe .
At the same time , it is obvious that these registers are inadequately supervised and insufficiently secure .
The whole of the Sirene organisation suffers from a palpable lack of public and parliamentary control .
That experience is unfortunately very disheartening .
Moreover , it has been denied access to important information in SIS .
This may be seen from the JSA ' s first annual reports .
This is completely unacceptable .
In order to obtain effective data protection , more than effective supervision is required .
More basic changes are needed when it comes to the rules governing the registers .
These different areas must not be covered by joint organisations and registers .
Public and parliamentary control must be reinforced , especially when it comes to Sirene and Schengen .
At present , the scope of the register goes far beyond what is necessary .
That is unreasonable .
A central place must be given to personal privacy and legal rights .
At the same time , however , we must ensure that there are adequate resources available .
The workload is increasing at a ferocious rate .
The independence of data protection bodies is the key to success here .
It is true that there are currently shortcomings in the Community legal framework in this area .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Then the Dublin Convention came into force .
I would be delighted if we could .
This has been a long , drawn-out business , and it concerns an important issue .
Why do we need Eurodac and what can it do ?
I do not know what she was hoping to achieve in this way .
The object of the exercise was simply to deal with Articles 22 and 23 .
For two quite crucial reasons .
This is particularly important in this case .
Therefore we as a Parliament support this .
There is also a second reason as to why we oppose the Council ' s proposal .
This proposal would whittle away Parliament ' s rights .
This will be our opportunity to make Europe a safer place , and to take action against abuse .
Let us seize this opportunity and use this chance to at last make Eurodac a reality .
I should very much like to support what Mr Pirker has just said .
Last November , the majority of the European Parliament adopted a report on the creation of the Eurodac system .
This important change is the reason why this report is being re-examined by this Chamber .
We wholly support the Commission on this .
When it comes to erasing personal data , it is just a question of being sensible .
That would be to view him as a potential criminal .
It is in adopting coherent and consistent positions that Parliament will enhance its stature .
It reveals the true face of liberal Europe , which is setting itself up as a besieged fortress .
Recording people ' s fingerprints on computer is an attack on individual freedom .
It infringes the legal protection due to refugees in being applied even to 14-year-olds .
Who , among you here , would dare take the fingerprints of a young lad of 14 ?
It fundamentally violates all the international conventions protecting human rights .
With this project , Fortress Europe is guilty of failing to assist refugees who are in danger .
It is our own freedoms that are at stake .
With this new text , this prerogative is clearly undermined .
The Council has demonstrated its lack of confidence in the Commission .
Sometimes in politics , things are indeed what they seem !
Mr President , I am grateful to Commissioner Vitorino for his work .
We are not one hundred percent happy .
Many of them are escaping from terror , from torture , from other experiences .
On this side of the House we are realistic .
That is why we are looking for the safeguards that have been put into the report .
We wish the Commission well in this work .
We are prepared to take on this challenge , in the hope that the Council will listen to us .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Minimum safety and health requirements for the use of work equipment
It is very interesting when you look at the statistics because the exact reasons become clear .
Almost 10 % of all occupational accidents involve falls from heights .
One in ten of those involves permanent invalidity or death .
Unfortunately , 1 000 are fatal .
Billions of pounds are spent caring for workers who have been injured or become ill .
This can largely be avoided .
The background to this proposal suggests additional reasons for having this legislation .
This directive will rectify this serious omission .
If Parliament rejects this addition , then it must hold itself responsible for the consequences .
The Commission ' s original intention was to present a proposal for a scaffolding directive .
The importance of working at heights and having this directive is clear also .
Some have questioned the validity of this legislation and they are free to do so .
What it does is provide for safe use of ladders and other equipment .
It uses safety equipment and devices .
If you are not familiar with them , do not enter the site .
Inform us of any situation of risk .
Unfortunately , every day we hear news of accidents at work .
The employer should consider money spent on safety at work as an investment .
In that year , four million seven hundred thousand accidents took place .
( The President cut the speaker off )
How many accidents are we talking about ?
When do they occur ?
How do they happen ?
What can we do to prevent them ?
This is a proper path to go down : the authorities cooperating with the two sides of industry .
Working at heights is not always for long periods of time but often for short spells .
I welcome the progress made and we should be able to continue in the same vein .
Let us examine a number of aspects , such as scaffold bearing surfaces .
You cannot have red lights everywhere .
Portable ladders must be anchored down and be solid , but they must remain serviceable .
Mr Perez Alvarez has already gone into this .
I am not happy on every count .
But there is one fundamental point I would like to make .
Safety measures are not the only things that cost .
This is how productive a moderate social policy is .
' But what about subsidiarity ? ' , goes the common cry .
This principle is not meant to render Europe completely inert !
We want to Europeanise the economy .
We have the single currency .
Minimum standards mean subsidiarity .
Each country can frame its own health and safety regulations provided that European minimum standards are observed .
We PPE-DE Group Members are opposed to European maximum standards .
In Germany the picture is completed by legal acts introduced by the social partners .
There are German standards and health and safety regulations for the workplace .
The Commission has proposed an amended directive on health and safety at work .
This report suggests it should be longer and more detailed .
UK Conservatives believe that we should vote against it for that very reason .
Of course it is .
It is not a question of whether or not the recommendations in the report are sound .
Many of them are and Peter Skinner has put a lot of thought into his work .
It is a question of what Parliament should be looking at as its priorities .
There is a problem in the UK , but not confined to the UK .
The EU is seen to be interfering .
The European Parliament is often seen to be interfering even more .
It is not seen as focusing on the big issues .
Our constituents ask us why they should vote for anybody at the European elections .
They ask : what are you doing for us ?
What shall we answer ?
This is the issue that we are discussing today .
Let us oppose this latest example of red tape from the top .
I say : Let it be now .
I think that this proposal reflects no credit on the European Union or on this House .
But there is no justification for a Europe-wide standard on this issue .
It can make no sense to legislate on how Europeans are permitted to climb ladders .
This should not be the priority for this House .
We can trust the people of Europe to decide for themselves how they climb ladders .
As my colleague has said , it is time for a change .
They seem to be engaging in a self-fulfilling prophecy .
It is hardly surprising that the British media project the sort of image that they describe .
40 000 of those falls are very serious and 1 000 result in deaths .
Try to explain to the families concerned that this is a trivial issue .
It is not .
It is described as bureaucratic .
But read the directive itself , read the proposal .
Is it onerous ?
Is it burdensome ?
Does it require detailed voluminous risk assessments before work is carried out a height ?
You are the people who are causing that .
Stop it now , please .
The same applies to national legislation on protection for workers , incidentally .
In other words , it is about competences and the judicious application of the subsidiarity principle .
We cannot , and must not , evade the issue any longer .
As a priority , ladders should be secured firmly using all possible means .
Ladders used for access should be long enough for their uprights to protrude sufficiently beyond the access platform .
Ladders in several sections shall be so used as to ensure that they are secure .
The holding of the ladder by another person as a safety measure shall not be allowed . '
This text is well meant and perfectly in order legally .
Instead what we ought to be doing is aiming for a directive which specifies our objectives .
National legislation is being enacted in this area to add to the existing national laws .
The two sides of industry are also extremely active in this area .
We Swedish Christian Democrats shall be voting against this report on the basis of the subsidiarity principle .
It is something concrete and it concerns people is every day lives .
The current proposal is a very important step towards doing something concrete about this .
I welcome your broad support .
It is obvious it is something more than bureaucracy .
With regard to Amendment No 1 , the issue is already covered by the text .
Amendment No 5 is covered by Amendment No 22 , which is accepted as it stands .
Furthermore , Recital 7 uses a standard form of words .
There are thus several reasons for not accepting Amendment No 6 .
Amendment No 7 advocates a change in Article 2 ( 3 ) .
This is established standard wording and the Commission therefore cannot accept a change to it .
I repeat my appreciation of your extensive work and it will improve the protection of workers in this field .
We will improve the protection we intend to provide with this initiative .
I am particularly pleased with the comments she has made .
That is why the legislation is there and is to be applied across the European Union .
Perhaps you can correct him instead of correcting us .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday , at 11 a.m.
Therefore , this particular piece of legislation falls within that context .
There are a number of ways in which competition policy is important in driving this agenda forward .
I have no doubt that the Commissioner ' s proposals will achieve that simplification .
Firstly , I welcome this process .
I know he has tabled amendments in relation to that .
That is what we have on the plus side .
We are also critical of some aspects , and there are certain things we would like to see .
The rapporteur touched on some of them , and I would like to explore them again .
Which market do we mean ?
The buying market , the selling market , the national market , the regional market ?
The Commission ' s chosen path is the right one .
Now , those positive aspects could not disguise certain deficiencies which had traditionally been demonstrated by the experts .
Perhaps the best-founded criticism referred to the rigidity of the rules .
I am not so concerned about legal certainty as some people .
Today , the single market is a reality and the culture of competition is sufficiently widespread .
Change was therefore necessary .
The time has now come to introduce reform in the field of horizontal restrictions .
I would therefore ask you to vote in favour of these amendments .
I repeat that in this sense we are in agreement .
Today ' s debate concerns a major aspect of our attempts to modernise competition policy .
These allegations are completely unfounded .
It is an important tool , particularly for small- and medium-sized businesses .
Consumers will benefit from these economic advantages , but only if effective competition is maintained on the market .
The draft resolution shows that Parliament supports the aims of the reform .
The questions raised by you and others contain extremely valuable suggestions .
I shall therefore propose to limit the duration of the exemption not to ten but to seven years .
Thirdly , the transitional period should be extended .
Mr President , this debate has touched on a number of other important , interesting points .
Mr Theonas , you raised the question of mergers .
Mr Evans raised the question of trade supplies .
This will be done in the chapter on production agreements .
That is why it would be inappropriate to include these agreements in the guidelines .
Finally , how does this all fit into the broader modernisation effort ?
That reform involves the elimination of the notification system .
This , however , Mr Karas , should not reduce the legal certainty for companies .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday , at 11 a.m.
Environmental dimension in the development process
When and if that happens , the health of our economies is also affected .
This matter has been debated by Parliament twice before .
Conciliation was initiated , and we are now seeing the result of this .
We have achieved what we were aiming for in a number of important areas .
Allow me to mention three important examples of these .
First of all , the budget is near enough double the size of the original amount .
We have gone from EUR 50 million to EUR 93 million .
That is a good thing , in my view .
With the conciliation we have achieved , we have taken a welcome step in that direction .
I therefore recommend that Parliament approve the result of the conciliation .
The path we chose was undoubtedly the right one .
We were able to make a few improvements to this draft regulation .
The Commission supports the proposed regulation currently before you .
It is , of course , a supplementary instrument to the others at the disposal of the Commission .
We are mainstreaming the environment in everything we do .
Plans to finance projects which will meet the objectives of the regulation are already advanced .
Sustainable management of forests in developing countries
We started from very different positions .
Our position is more inclined towards giving greater competences to the Commission in this area .
Parliament has managed to secure adequate funding .
In this scenario , the land becomes poor in humus and desertification soon follows .
The Commission supports the proposed text before you .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Nielson .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Complementarity on development cooperation policies
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mrs Ferrer on having produced a balanced report .
It is important that we recognise the role of the EU and the extent of its influence .
We demand coherence and coordination .
Only those countries whose economy is in decent shape can benefit from globalisation .
Conditionality must have its place .
In other cases we have to confine ourselves just to humanitarian aid .
In fact the risk is considerable .
Aid must be directed in such a way that it brings benefit to the worst-off of all .
In channelling aid we have to see to it that it does not prop up undemocratic state structures .
For that reason the EU should not shy away from it .
Her report can , however , be considered to be an important contribution .
If we do not adopt this policy , we will not be efficient in terms of development cooperation .
I share her disappointment that we are discussing this in isolation .
We certainly do not share this view .
We need to abolish poverty in the world .
This is more important than complementarity .
There is no doubt that a more coordinated policy would have a far greater impact .
Is the Council actually prepared to change the system of comitology ?
This , in my opinion , is a sine qua non .
We do not want to be an extension of the Bretton Woods institutions .
We want to play a leading role in the world .
In practice , however , both leave something to be desired .
The payments , for example , pose a problem .
We will take a stance to this effect in the discussion on coordination and complementarity .
This is absurd and is something of a disaster .
That is what Mrs Ferrer demonstrates , and the heading of her report highlights the key concept of complementarity .
This is not the first time we have discussed this issue in Parliament , of course .
Approximately 60 % of all financial aid comes out of the European pot .
Theoretical transactions do little to help our case though .
Nor can it be denied that there have been successes that should be shouted from the rooftops .
Take Mozambique and the deployment of ECHO , for example .
There was a rapid reaction from the Member States too .
What we are lacking is the aforementioned three C ' s .
Coherence can only be achieved if strategies and measures are brought into line .
Complementarity and coordination are important pre-requisites for creating synergy .
I therefore welcome Mrs Ferrer ' s report .
Parliament and the Commission share the same considerations and agree on the approach .
We agree that we now need to see results .
The Commission has already taken the first step .
We have adopted a harmonised framework for the elaboration of the country strategy papers .
We will use this framework in future programming exercises .
The country strategy papers will guide us when reviewing our assistance programmes .
They will indicate how Community assistance fits in with what other donors are doing .
The move towards sector-wide programmes will greatly facilitate this process .
I also hope it will produce greater cost effectiveness .
Let me comment on some details of your report .
I agree .
This is the reason we speak about the policy of the three Cs : complementarity , coherence and coordination .
From today the Commission has a clear policy .
It is now up to the Member States .
This is a very good decision .
We , in the Commission , share your concern .
It is paramount that we improve the effectiveness and visibility of the EU at international level .
I have been invited to participate in the development committee in the World Bank .
No Commissioner has tried that before .
We also work well with our partners at multilateral level .
The lack of human resources is a serious and real problem that for too long has been ignored .
It has come back to haunt us and now requires action .
We are continuing our efforts at the Commission to improve the effectiveness of our services .
We are radically changing how we do things but this is not enough .
We also need the human resources to match our programme resources and ambitions .
Your support here will be crucial when the budgetary decisions have to be taken .
We need to find more effective ways of working together .
The support of Parliament is also vital .
I do not think this is the case .
We also have a clear commitment on the ninth EDF and the financial perspective .
In conclusion , I should like to thank the rapporteur again for her excellent work .
I am confident that the European Parliament will provide us with the necessary support in these endeavours .
I look forward to continuing to work with you in an open and constructive manner .
The reform process is now moving .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Nielson .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
( The sitting was suspended at 7.55 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
Trade in goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products
These are basic agricultural products and products that have undergone initial processing .
Non-Annex 1 products are those that have been processed a second time .
No alternative solution to the system of refunds on agricultural products has been seriously looked into .
That said , agricultural product refunds present a range of risks and disadvantages .
The European agri-foodstuffs industry ought to be encouraged to give preference to Community raw materials .
That is why we are in favour of establishing quotas for the scheme .
They play an essential role where SMEs are concerned .
It is particularly galling that the decision to impose these cuts was taken without consultation with this House .
Export refunds are not a subsidy .
This is deeply unfair .
The Commission must devise a new system .
Access to IPR offers only a very unsatisfactory and temporary solution .
He is fundamentally correct in describing the Commission proposal as a temporary measure .
Mr President , this proposal relates to an extremely delicate area .
The greatest responsibility in this area falls to the Commission .
Mr Souchet has produced a wonderful report , and I congratulate him on his work as rapporteur .
All of this is correct , as well as his demands for exemptions in favour of small exporters .
Mr President , the Commission is proposing changes to trade arrangements for processed agricultural products .
The purpose is to end subsidies and restrict them by means of a certificate .
The food processing chain and , ultimately , the farmers , are going to foot this bill .
Already the market situation is putting immense pressure on the European producer .
The Commission is proposing selective deterioration .
We are , however , in a position of constraint .
The changes must take account of small companies active in this sector of industry .
There should be some flexibility in setting the restrictions in respect of export aid procedures .
For that reason , the wording of Amendment No 8 is justified .
It provides a degree of flexibility , especially for small companies .
This is a question of temporary solutions only .
Our group supports the committee ' s amendments .
' Active processing trade ' - what on earth does that mean ?
We were absolutely convinced at first that there was no chance of this working .
An apparently elegant solution was being proposed , which undermined the WTO negotiations somewhat .
I would like to offer my compliments to the rapporteur .
We endorse your report , but we intend to reject the legislative resolution .
But the regulation changes the essence of inward processing .
Inward processing would then open the door to cereal imports from the world market .
We should be very much aware of that price , which is passed on to the food industry .
It is inevitable that some industries will lose their export subsidies in the process .
A number of industries process only a small proportion of their agricultural products into finished products .
Small exporters , on the other hand , deserve more protection .
We back the amendments which have their interests in mind .
These objectives are not under threat .
The third risk relates to our negotiating strategy for the Millennium Round .
All this will have to be " put on the table " and reduced under the GATT rules .
This situation in fact was validated by the World Trade Organisation .
Already our competitors have demonstrated their negotiating skills in this crucial area of international policy .
They have my unequivocal support .
I am in complete agreement with Mr Souchet .
Thank you very much for all the work you have put into the report .
He rightly complains that the Commission is offering no alternative courses of action .
Sugar is a case in point .
As I said , sugar is a particular case in point .
I am extremely pleased with it .
As long as this is the case , we cannot in fact do without refunds .
This will also need to be spelled out clearly during the forthcoming WTO negotiations .
The second point concerns the budget .
Surely , this cannot be the argument .
So the money is available and the solution should thus be in sight .
The fact remains that the agricultural policy is , in principle , there for the benefit of farmers .
This is why it has been framed with the European rural areas in mind .
In this sense , an interim regulation is essential .
In addition , I should also call on the Commission to give due consideration to small- and medium-sized businesses .
We all agree on the need to promote the Union ' s processed food industry competitive position .
The Commission can agree with your proposed Amendments Nos 2 , 6 , 10 , 13 and 15 .
This relates to the first of the amendments .
This concerns Amendments Nos 3 , 11 and 14 .
This relates to part of Amendments Nos 1 , 4 , 12 and 16 .
Mr President , permit me to address two comments to the Commission .
No , it is too low on the world market because farmers cannot produce at this price .
Secondly , this is a report according to Article 37 .
It is then highly likely that we will enter negotiations .
I just wanted to give you advance notice .
Mr President , thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to do so .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday , at 11 a.m ..
Enforcement of civil and commercial judgments
I want to use this occasion to say something about the importance of what we are doing here .
These two articles , in whatever combination , have to be read together .
They have not created real ease of access to justice .
I have covered the main aspects .
The rapporteur has referred to this , but e-commerce is an area which is set to grow .
I shall now continue , Mr President , on behalf of the PPE .
Let us look at this briefly .
That is like saying : " There should not be firemen in towns or cities .
If a house burns down , the owners should be insured " .
We must create good legislation , which is balanced for everyone .
It can lead to lower prices for them .
Both business and industry can gain from a common sense approach to this .
In my constituency they want to buy cheaper cars from France and the Netherlands .
Internet service providers have a role to play in this .
ADRs , therefore , cannot be a replacement for legal remedy .
More work needs to be done in the area .
I cannot deprive my constituents of their right to sue in their own courts .
They are entitled to their own system of justice and we have to continue to support that .
I am very pleased that in my country the CBI has backed Mrs Wallis ' approach .
This will send a bad signal to consumers .
I appeal , therefore , for some common sense in this debate .
I know that no legislation is perfect .
That is why I believe also that this two-year review clause is sensible .
We now have to work to find practical and effective ways to resolve disputes .
This cannot be at the expense of consumers .
The opinion on this report revolves around Articles 15 and 17 .
This problem has been exaggerated totally out of proportion .
But , where they go beyond that , it is the consumer who is most disadvantaged .
The bigger businesses will be able to afford legal assistance .
The astute and sensible SME can insure for a modest premium .
We are consultees .
I believe that Commissioner Vitorino shares his view .
From the Council ' s perspective , the UK Government expressed a similar view .
We could say that , because we are only consultees , we can say what we like .
We have the opportunity to build on the already substantial achievements in the committee ' s final report .
I hope that we will go further .
I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Wallis , for her persistence .
It has been a long and hard road .
The amendments shift the balance in the report towards traders and away from consumers .
The committee did , however , agree to take a coherent approach to the law relating to the internet .
I want to compliment Mrs Wallis on the preparation and the presentation of her report .
This has been justified very clearly in the report .
At the expense of repeating myself , this will ensure that it is to the citizens ' advantage .
Today , new players are emerging in the construction of international market rules .
It is they who introduce new rules and new ways of settling disputes .
They are an expression of the market 's constant need to move forward and expand .
There is interaction between regulation and self regulation .
What can businesses do , faced with the handicap of rigid regulations , especially the small- and medium-sized businesses ?
I only do so when there is a reason .
I also want to point out that the debate has been frustrating to some degree .
We must resolve the issue of which is to be the competent court .
We cannot proceed as often on the basis of where events have taken place .
This also emerged yesterday from our seminar on cyber crime .
What is to be taken as the domicile address ?
I should like finally to strike a biblical note .
I look to other legislation to see what analogies or what benefits can be drawn from it .
Why not put in place a similar requirement on on-line trading companies ?
That is why , more than anything else today , we need to put this regulation in place .
We do not need to defer it any longer .
We do not need to put any more mud into the water .
Let us agree on this report and then make changes in other areas as they come before us .
It goes back to an era before not only the Internet but even before the commercially available personal computer .
It is for this reason that the jurisdictional aspects and arguments must be squeezed out of disputes .
The world has moved on .
I wonder whether you could justify why you have decided to ignore the clock ?
Allow me to explain why .
The terminology , as it is currently before us , is clear .
Let me illustrate this with an example .
Contractual freedom is a fundamental principle .
Diana Wallis as a distinguished international lawyer has been the ideal person to work on this very complex file .
I have certainly learned a great deal from it .
The way that the committee has finally structured its approach strikes exactly the right balance .
I fundamentally disagree with that .
What we have done is offer small companies the alternative of doing something else .
They can offer consumers alternative jurisdiction but only under very specific conditions .
You press the button , you move your mouse , you make a conscious decision .
How many of you realised that you were accepting them ?
In the on-line world , we must think differently .
I would give my wholehearted support to the conclusion reached in the Legal Affairs Committee .
It does not strip consumers of their pre-existing rights .
Even more importantly , it will also threaten the new economy and the e-economy in the European Union .
With the Commission ' s proposals , we certainly have the worst of both worlds .
The scope of this regulation is therefore very broad .
This is the broad legal framework .
It covers both contractual and non-contractual matters .
Various types of special contract , such as employment or insurance contracts , are therefore dealt with separately .
Why is it that we cannot avoid discussing the issue of the judicial approach ?
We are prepared to incorporate this phrase into the amended proposal .
This action would , however , have two consequences for Article 15 .
We are therefore not inclined to retain the first part of Amendment No 23 .
On the other hand , we have problems with Amendment No 24 , which concerns Article 16 .
I am referring here to Article 17 .
The issue of the binding nature of these decisions is extremely important .
My view is that this proposal would create a compulsory arbitration system for resolving these consumer disputes .
Thank you very much , Mr Vitorino , for your extensive intervention .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday , at 11 a.m.
( The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m. )
( The President cut the speaker off )
However , this is a decision taken by the competent bodies of this Parliament .
We have taken note of your opinion .
Who wants to comment on yesterday ' s Minutes ?
They have , as yet , been unable to start the first term of the new school year .
It was originally scheduled for 7 September .
Yet no alternative arrangements were made for the children .
I cannot believe what is going on !
School attendance is compulsory and yet the children are unable to fulfil this requirement .
We will see what we can do .
Terrorism in Spain
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on terrorism in Spain .
This debate is opened on behalf of the Council and Commission .
The European dimension of the fight against terrorism is not , however , a recent concept .
For its part , the Commission is cooperating with the Member States and with Europol with the same aim .
Nevertheless , these new attacks unfortunately show that these efforts are still not enough to eliminate terrorism .
We must go further in terms of European cooperation .
Mr Galeote , I hear what you are saying .
We expect him here any minute .
I would actually like to ask you to make a start .
We have heard the Commissioner ' s statement .
I hope my message is clear .
Today , thanks to this debate , they are a little less alone .
In no instance can violent nationalism be compatible with the ideals of the European Union .
As you know , there is a Europol department dedicated to combating terrorism .
The Spanish Government , for example , would like a European arrest warrant to be established .
But there is a clearly defined line that separates us .
Thank you , Mr Galeote , for your contribution .
The fact that this is the way things are done is extremely tragic and difficult to take in .
( The House observed a minute ' s silence ) President .
It is important for a Parliament to speak out in public on this kind of matter .
No political objective justifies the use of violence .
This paragraph rejects dialogue with any group that tolerates terrorism or that is involved in it .
If ETA does not give up its weapons , we shall not give up ours .
We have no others .
Mr President , we should all be in a position to sign the declaration .
Where would Commissioner Reding stand as a result ?
Allow me , if you will , to make a small personal confession .
Without those Greeks , Western culture would be inconceivable .
That is not true .
The Irish peace process was based on the unconditional cease-fire of the Provisional IRA .
( Applause ) No one can be invited to join in this dialogue .
( Applause )
Mr President , more than 15 000 people have been arrested , more than 5 000 tortured .
Hundreds of people have been killed .
Can the European Parliament collaborate with state terrorism ?
( Loud protests and heckling )
Today , more than ever , the great majority of the Basque people remain committed to non-violence .
( Continued protests )
We stand ready to help in any way the peace process .
( Protests , pounding on desks )
Here you see the Spanish idea of freedom of speech and democracy .
( Continuing protests )
( Applause )
The message we should send out is that there should be an absolute and complete end to violence .
We must never lose hope .
We must never lose faith in the fact that freedom and democracy are values for all time .
Parliament needs to facilitate dialogue between the democrats .
Ladies and gentlemen , this is an extremely sensitive issue .
I shall now give Mr Gorostiaga the floor on a procedural motion .
Mr President , that honours you greatly .
You are really democratic because you accept free speech .
That is what is impossible for the Spanish democrats to accept .
Mr President , I am now in a position to provide Parliament with more details .
Can you honestly assure me of that , Mr Gorostiaga ?
The debate is closed .
I should like to thank the Council and Commission for their input .
The next item is the joint debate on the oral questions :
I therefore appeal to the sponsors of these amendments to consider withdrawing them .
Europe must be seen to fly the flag on this issue .
I hope , Baroness , that I have given as full an answer as possible .
The two monsters in Europe today are terrorism and racism .
And these , unfortunately , are the subject of our debate today .
Odysseus overcame both monsters , but he needed ingenuity , persistence and courage .
Today , the political , democratic leadership of Europe has to play the role of Odysseus .
Unfortunately , the clouds of racism are still hovering over Europe .
There are numerous dimensions to the fight against racism at European level .
We are about to enter the second stage of this joint action .
The Treaty of Amsterdam is a really important weapon in Europe ' s institutional arsenal .
Articles 29 and 13 allow us to adopt quite specific policies .
Finally , the Strasbourg conference is a very important event .
The Commission is also involved from the point of view of theoretical and political proposals .
Mr President , racism is indeed a scourge affecting our society .
It is even one of the most appalling human failings , and no one has a monopoly on it .
Europe wishes to be a civilised society , and has the opportunity every day to show that it is .
Our position must be clear , intelligible and specific .
Our position must be clear , without going into unnecessary details .
Personally , I am all in favour of brief texts .
In such instances we have a duty to remember and a duty to be vigilant .
Our message must be an ambitious one .
We must be a role model .
The European Union is the product of this development .
We must make use of this opportunity and make a clear European contribution to this conference .
We often condemn the perpetrators of such violence .
The only possible response is a hardline attitude .
Now , there are very strict laws against racism in Italy .
I therefore do not understand why we are being accused of racism .
This was an opportune debate at the appropriate level .
It seems logical that this paradox is very much playing on the minds of the Germans .
Our fellow MEP , André Brie provides a clear and plausible answer to this .
This attitude is , to this day , leaving its mark in the east of the united Germany .
On a voluntary basis , I think Europe would be prepared to finance this proposal .
No one in this House becomes an anti-fascist by denouncing their political opponents as fascists .
One cannot escape one ' s own history and one ' s own responsibility that easily .
Austria still belongs to the European Council , and no one spoke to us on that occasion .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , what is this debate actually about ?
But this debate should never be misused for other purposes .
Mr Ford defamed my country , Austria , in his statement .
Had he read the report , he would have found that that is patently untrue .
There are no problems there of the kind he describes .
These are all things that work people into a state of panic , given the sensitivity of the issue .
We ought not to be so superficial and submissive in our dealings with this issue .
The matter is far too serious for that .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Sichrovsky has just given us some food for thought .
It is true that being on the left does not make you proof against a fascist mindset .
History has borne this out .
How do we mobilise this majority ?
That is the question we must ask ourselves .
I will tell you something , Mr Sichrovsky , you represent the Freedom Party .
People who criticise your party are not disparaging Austria as a whole .
The same applies to you , Mr Pirker , in every sense .
Therefore I say again : this is a European battle .
( Applause from the left )
Which is worse ?
This is the road to ruin .
Mr President , Mr Schulz called me a racist .
Thank you , Mr President , for giving me the opportunity to respond .
He described himself as a representative of a country notorious for its perpetrators of fascism .
The past few months in particular have seen a whole spate of racially motivated criminal acts in Germany .
But hysteria makes for a poor counsellor .
Mr President , there has been some interest in my commitment to Austria .
Can I congratulate Baroness Ludford on her report .
She has put a great deal of work into it .
There is still a view that there is not really any racism in Europe .
I reject that .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I come from Leipzig , from East Germany that is .
It is wrong to picture East Germany as being predominantly right-wing extremist in its leanings .
I believe it is also wrong to maintain that the young people are right-wing extremists .
I feel that is a very important sign .
We Germans will not submit to being terrorised by a minority .
It is our democracy that is being put to the test here .
Speaking as a European , I beseech you not to write East Germany off as a region .
That the state and political leaders have a responsibility goes without saying .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Diamantopoulou .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
These ill-gotten gains are laundered and go into circulation in the legal economy .
An action plan of this kind will undoubtedly help to achieve this objective .
The criticism is justified , for more reason than one .
Another broken promise .
There are other examples I could mention .
The Council is bound , nonetheless , to comply with the terms of the Treaty .
We are pleased to see the work carried out by Parliament .
We cannot afford such luxuries in this area .
Mr President , I should like to thank the French Presidency for its very clear statement .
The Member States must define common penalties and adopt a consistent overall policy .
The fight against organised crime is an important undertaking , where we must not fail .
The victims expect a great deal of us and this is a challenge we must accept .
The Europe we want to build is a Europe of rights .
One of these rights is the right to security for all .
I understand why it is happening .
The presidency ' s term is only six months and every presidency is keen to flex its political muscles .
This is how it goes .
However , this Parliament cannot accept this as an excuse for being kept in the dark .
I would now like to turn to European crime prevention .
This does not appear to be happening .
This is a missed opportunity .
Documents are not what we need to fight crime .
Instead we need to tackle crime head-on .
Mr President , it will take time to harmonise the penal systems .
I should also like to congratulate the French Presidency on their statement to us .
The fight against this type of crime therefore requires urgent action .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
No problem at all .
We , for our part , certainly are not .
I am sure the Quaestors have noted the point you have made .
Mr President , I would like to support the rapporteur ' s motion .
So far , the Commission has not seen fit to adopt these improvements .
We want this regulation but we want it with our improvements .
I hope the honourable Members will recognise this and give us their backing .
Mr President , on a point of order .
That is why we are now in this situation of sending this back to committee .
This a very unsatisfactory way of doing business .
It was like a dialogue of the deaf last night .
( Parliament approved the request )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
On Amendment No 12
( Parliament accepted the oral amendment ) On Amendment No 15
( More than twelve Members objected to the oral amendment ; the President therefore declared it inadmissible )
Mr President , this protest from the left is unacceptable .
Italy has the Red Brigades and Spain has ETA .
( Uproar )
These are all very interesting political games but the procedure is that we hold the debate and vote afterwards .
We do not hold a debate during the vote .
You are right to call these political games .
On Amendment No 16
You could have made that oral amendment but we have already voted on that amendment .
You are all buffoons !
That is a very interesting point of view .
Nowadays , the perpetuators of racist crimes and actions belong to the extreme right wing .
It would be another matter if the debate were about extremism .
So , for five minutes , let us calm down .
( Loud applause )
Thank you , it is always nice to hear the voice of reason .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Wijkman report ( A5-0215 / 2000 )
It is a report which is intended to assist developing countries in preserving the environment .
How can we even dissociate development from the environment ?
The cure would be worse than the disease .
It would be a flash in the pan , destined to burn itself out .
Fernández Martín report ( A5-0216 / 2000 )
I agree with him . In this way we might achieve more and spend less .
There is no sustainable development except in the context of the responsible use of the environment .
Skinner report ( A5-0222 / 2000 )
My friend and fellow party member , Mr Bushill-Matthews , called for the report to be rejected .
This was also untrue .
It is important that untruths are rapidly rebutted .
This explanation of vote is necessary in order to correct the record .
This is an area in which the EU ought not to have so much influence .
We are basically well disposed towards the European Union .
All other questions ought to be dealt with at local , regional or national levels .
This is not one such area .
Against this background , we have chosen , as Swedish Christian Democrats , to vote against the report .
It should desist now , and this assembly should reject this directive .
Hernández Mollar report ( A5-0225 / 2000 )
The continued existence of national control points is beyond doubt .
Legal protection must be provided as close to the citizens as possible .
At long last , a constructive , truly expedient measure at Community level .
Pirker report ( A5-0219 / 2000 )
This Convention was signed on 15 June 1990 .
I , of course , unreservedly support this position .
It will always be essential for a system of this kind to be subject to democratic control .
That being the case , we support Mr Pirker ' s report .
Eurodac will be an effective tool for ensuring that the Dublin Convention operates effectively .
Wallis report ( A5-0253 / 2000 )
Modernising the Brussels Convention is legally in order .
This reform will undoubtedly help to achieve this goal in a way that is not to be underestimated .
Glase report ( A5-0220 / 2000 )
Mr President , ' illegal work ' could also be referred to as ' underground work ' .
' Why underground ? ' , you may ask , Mr President . Sadly , this is the situation .
So it is scandalous to attempt to blame them for their own misfortune , even in part .
At the same time , however , many people resort to using this cheap workforce .
I am well aware that finding solutions is not an easy matter .
The other sectors , where profits are considered to be less extensive or less quick , are contracted out .
Such sub-contracting effectively promotes the outsourcing of work .
We therefore abstained on this report .
Undeclared gainful employment is just a euphemism for illicit work .
And there are mountains of regulations for tackling illicit work .
But introducing new European regulations is no way to go about tackling the problem of illicit work .
Illicit work must be tackled at the roots .
Illegal immigration must be prevented , and many Member States are too lax on this front .
I would like to start by assuring you that we support Mrs Glase ' s work .
However , three points are worth noting .
We need agencies and institutions to keep a close eye on companies .
Resolution on racism ( B5-0766 / 2000 )
It is not clear whether they were lying or whether they were confused .
I am not sure which is worse .
Mr President , what a heated debate this has been on racism !
As representative of the Pensioners ' Party , I abstained in the vote on this report .
Is the Pensioners ' Party on the left or the right ?
You will not find anything of this kind in Austria .
This resolution is a fine declaration against racism .
There would have been a different outcome if the vote on Eurodac had been truly anti-racist .
Resolution on organised crime ( B5-0506 / 2000 )
However , we reject a European-wide standardisation of criminal law provisions .
That concludes the vote .
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
( The sitting was closed at 12.30 p.m. )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday , 15 December 2000 .
Statements by the President
( The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence )
I should also like to wish the 180 people injured in this awful fire a speedy recovery .
( The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence )
He had disturbed his killers as they were preparing an attack .
( The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence )
Referral back to committee
( Parliament approved the request )
Sittings from 15 to 18 January in Strasbourg President .
I have received no requests for amendments to the agenda for Monday , Tuesday or Wednesday .
Thank you , Mr Dell ' Alba .
I will , of course , take note of your comment .
Madam President , I shall be delighted to reply to Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna .
This is the thinking that led the Socialist Group to make this request .
Thank you , Mr Barón Crespo .
Mr Varela , Mr Barón Crespo has given you your answer .
It clearly is appropriate .
The statement is therefore welcome . In no way do we oppose it .
Far from it . Our group has also supported it .
In that case , the rapporteurs would not be able to reply to the Commissioner during the joint debate .
Mr Varela ' s request is out of place .
This is an important issue that goes beyond the limits of responsibility of one group .
This is why I propose an urgent debate on this matter .
We are against invoking the urgent procedure on this issue .
Madam President , first of all , Mr Poettering can be forgiven for his mistake since he was absent .
May I conclude that there is broad consensus on Mr Barón Crespo ' s proposal ?
I can see that this is the case .
I therefore believe that this is a good suggestion .
Madam President , the big problem is that so much is happening on the world stage .
This is the case for Algeria .
Madam President , I would like to continue with the subject of the Thursday sitting .
I know that a few dozen people at most will remain to vote .
Madam President , on a point of order .
A number of other junior employees of independent television are being arrested and interrogated as we sit here now .
Madam President , could we take this matter into consideration ?
You met the deputy chairman of Media-Most in June , Mr Malashenko .
If this is correct , would you share the contents of that letter with us ?
I have not received any such letter .
If I had , I would naturally have informed the House .
I trust that you will pursue this matter .
This is not the first time .
We fly to Strasbourg with Regional Airlines .
Today too , we had to fly via Paris to Strasbourg .
Madam President , on a point of order .
That seizure was an illegal act .
Mr Tsiakourmas is now being held in North Cyprus .
I would appeal to the House to express its sympathy with Mr Tsiakourmas and his family .
He has been accused of a crime of which I do not think he is guilty .
He was abducted from the territory of a European Union Member State .
My fellow Member has described the circumstances and I need add no further details .
Mr Alyssandrakis , we shall see what we can do about this .
I listened closely to both your speech and that made by the Member before you .
This is not an isolated case , rather such instances are mounting up .
I would urge you to press the Council to observe the Rules of Procedure .
They killed people .
They fired on prisoners .
Few cases of torture are admitted by the Spanish courts .
On the contrary , many officials are promoted because of such activities .
Inside the European Union that is simply not tolerable .
It is incumbent upon us to press the Spanish Government on this issue .
I am sure that you will want to respond fully and rapidly to this concern .
In the meantime , I agree with him .
I think the sooner this is on the Internet , the better .
It is a matter of public record .
There is no reason why it should be kept secret .
That is the point I believe the Quaestors will be urging on the Bureau in the near future .
As rapporteur , I can completely identify with the thrust of this report .
All our amendments pertain to Article 20 , which deals with the exceptions to the rule .
These are Articles 20 ( 1 ) ( h ) and 20 ( 2 ) .
The second type of amendment pertains to the deletion of a number of exceptions to the main rule .
These exceptions had been worded in an ambiguous manner and were open to interpretation .
In the first instance , I wanted to see these articles deleted .
The only problem was that certain parties within the Council could not live with completely deleting these articles .
The compromise still prescribes the deletion of the three articles , but three other articles will be inserted instead .
We are thus tabling two types of amendment .
It is vital to do that .
I would congratulate Mrs Peijs on her work .
Although the text in its current form is absolutely excellent , some clarification is needed .
The text ought , therefore , to be adopted without delay and transposed by the Member States .
I regret that the dispute in the Council has led to this being delayed by more than a decade .
But this is not about apportioning blame .
That has been made crystal clear again here .
That is guaranteed under this proposed directive .
This directive spearheads the action plan for financial services .
As it happens , Mrs Peijs , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group , has tabled five new amendments .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon .
Simpler legislation for the internal market ( SLIM )
The Netherlands , as far as this is concerned , is no exception .
This is a heavy burden , which hits small companies particularly hard .
Many are deterred by the administrative red tape involved .
The consequences can be disastrous , as a recent incident in the Netherlands proved once more .
Particular attention will need to be paid to the way in which legislation is developed .
The Netherlands has seen the recent introduction of Actal , which I mentioned a moment ago .
I believe that much value is attached to this approach in many other quarters too .
Furthermore , the six-month deadline proposed by the rapporteur should be taken seriously .
We do have debates on speeding up the legislative process from time to time here in Parliament .
Our rapporteur also referred to this .
We sometimes think that the different parts are operating in isolation .
So we must consider the whole process when we draft the original legislation .
But the SLIM process ought to go much further .
All credit to Mr Doorn , who has managed to put his finger on the problem .
The causes are obvious .
It should be anything but that .
That particular subject came up in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
We need to have clearer definitions of what is going on .
So we are in favour , but there are two things we want to add .
Firstly , we have to ensure that political control remains with the Commission and Parliament .
However , we would also wish to go further in a different direction .
What we would like to see are proposals for dealing with economy of legislation as well as simplicity .
We welcome the fact that Commissioners Bolkestein and Liikanen are looking at various pilot projects in this area .
While such claims can be made , obviously we in this Parliament will look rather ludicrous .
Our review of the SLIM initiative and this report have demonstrated where and how the initiative can be improved .
Any suggestions in this connection from this Parliament are , of course , welcome .
I am therefore looking forward to reporting on the progress made during the next couple of months .
I am with him on that one .
I , too , would like to see this happen .
I would like to underline this point .
The Commission receives many requests .
That is an important matter which also merits much attention in this Parliament .
An enquiry in this connection was also submitted this afternoon .
I am mentioning this particularly for the benefit of Mrs Kauppi .
I am already looking forward to the report and the recommendations of this working group .
I am very grateful to him for that .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon .
Quality evaluation in school education
Consider , in addition , technology , information technology and the different cultures .
It is also important to encourage schools to cooperate at national and European level .
That is the modern way of communicating .
Parliament will be monitoring the developments closely .
I am interested to hear your reaction .
Mr President , this report is strongly supported by the PPE-DE Group .
Indeed , we have supported it throughout the entire procedure .
We congratulate the Commissioner and the rapporteur on their work to achieve that .
Therefore , any attempts to improve standards in our schools must be welcomed with open arms .
This report seeks a balance between the need for adequate preparation in both those fields .
The point made by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte about social exclusion is particularly valid .
Do different countries have different patterns ?
Education cannot just be looked at from the limited point of view of competitiveness .
Well-organised education means that national resources are being put to the best possible use .
We are making good progress with this important issue .
That criterion is no longer enough on its own , and has not been for a long time .
Each one of us can ask the question how important common quality monitoring is in our own environment .
It has also led to increasing levels of care and concern across the borders .
Unfortunately , a great deal of resources are still needed in many countries in order to achieve this .
The European education systems must become attuned to the information society .
Rapid scientific and technological change , together with globalisation , demand superior educational standards .
What constitutes a good school education these days ?
Is it about imparting knowledge and expertise ?
There is more to it than that .
The social divide between the informed and the uninformed must be bridged .
The difference is thus quite considerable .
Moreover , it does not always work the same way and depends on the circumstances .
That is why it is in all our interests to share our experiences .
However , it is difficult to carry out any reform precisely because of this inflexibility .
It would not be a question of setting targets with a view to obligatory harmonisation .
This networked coordination is more decentralised and flexible and more liberal than the standard harmonisation directive .
There is more to education than equipping people for employment .
Its goal must be the all-round development of young people as individuals .
Those who do not have basic knowledge do not know where to acquire knowledge either .
The cultural techniques of reading , calculating and writing form part of this knowledge base .
The new technologies offer new opportunities to acquire knowledge and employ our cultural techniques .
It is essential not to confuse education with training .
So in our comparisons and benchmarking we have to look beyond narrow league table approaches .
That is why I welcome this report .
The debate on how to carry out evaluation is futile and misleading .
What does make sense is to debate the essence of the problem .
What type of person do schools mould and for what sort of society ?
I particularly welcome the emphasis on social inclusion .
Education is an important , indeed crucial , part of society .
Our education has an impact on all our lives and our communities as well .
These are placed higher on the agenda than academia and at an early age .
It will also provide an excellent opportunity to encourage schools in the different regions to share in good practices .
Networking is so important .
Today ' s business is to examine the draft recommendation on quality evaluation of school education .
The recommendation relates to two crucial points .
Secondly , the role of European cooperation in this area .
In this process , the Commission shall not prescribe any rules and is fulfilling its role as a catalyst .
That is precisely what the Lisbon European Council asked us to do .
That is actually the goal of a knowledge society .
This will result in comparative studies being made and relevant institutions being networked .
Thank you very much , Mrs Reding .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
World cultural and natural heritage
It forms part of their everyday environment and their own identity .
It strengthens the sense of belonging to the European Union by identifying the roots we all share .
A port may be classified , for example , without any regard for the boats .
A steel plant may be classified without regard for the equipment .
There is often need for heritage to be restored .
This aspect might be included in the deliberations on the harmonisation of European tax systems .
Protection of heritage is an area over which we must be continually vigilant .
It is our responsibility to hand this heritage on to future generations .
This simplifies neither the decision-making process nor the selection procedures .
As I see it , these are criteria that can primarily only be managed at regional level .
The importance of world cultural heritage sites transcends the scope of regional development .
They are cultural treasures , and bear witness to epoch-making changes and unique occurrences in nature .
They have outstanding universal value .
They trace the development of the working process of our document , and also elsewhere in the world .
I therefore consider this report to be superfluous .
Obviously , we have no intention of superseding national policy .
There are , unfortunately , numerous examples from Greece alone .
We should like to save it , quite how I do not know .
The UEN Group will vote in favour of this report .
This percentage is an average , because in eastern Germany the rate is as much as 80 % .
Nonetheless , the response was overwhelming .
Only 26 % of the French have confidence in this artificial currency .
This is how national currencies should be protected , as if they were part of world heritage .
They have submitted many applications , so much so that this has led to an imbalance .
Our historic monument days are always very well attended .
Our cultural heritage is an excellent tool to make the European dimension visible .
Another point where the European Union can fulfil a typically European task is research and education .
Thirdly , I would mention the deployment of structural funds .
Preserving cultural heritage is important for tourism .
It brings cultural diversity into focus .
It has a bearing on employment .
That is what has given us the incredibly diverse and many-sided Europe with which we are familiar .
That is why we are all responsible for protecting our heritage and protecting this diversity .
To return to my opening remarks , this does not limit our responsibility in the area of heritage conservation .
What is the value of these prizes ?
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
( The Minutes were approved )
Mr President , there have been further developments regarding the report on the 1997 discharge .
Needless to say , the reforms should help restore confidence in Europe .
A serious start has been made on reforms .
I will give you a few examples .
Parliament is issued with six-monthly reports on this .
In 1996 , this project , which is subsidised by the European Union , was 97 % complete .
In April 1999 , this Parliament found out about this scandalous state of affairs .
I would like to take the opportunity to go into Mr van Dam ' s amendment very briefly .
Needless to say , there are also areas of concern with regard to the 1997 discharge .
This Parliament will monitor the follow-up of all reports brought by the Commission .
I will not go into all these areas but highlight a few .
The more transparency , the better .
An added benefit is that the national parliaments can bring their governments to book .
Continuity , transparency and clear competences are vital parameters in this .
Control without referring back to errors detected previously is a job half-done .
They were clearly set out last year .
Now we have a follow-up to check that those points have been implemented .
We look forward to receiving regular reports from the Personal Representatives Group .
External aid , however , is an area where we still see substantial problems .
Once again , I thank the rapporteur and congratulate her on a job well done .
She is rather pleased with the reams of paper which the Commission has produced .
I am waiting for more substance , for results .
Furthermore , I am unconvinced by all the Commission ' s good intentions .
Instead of openness and transparency , the scheme exudes an atmosphere of damage limitation .
Is this not a case where the burden of proof should be reversed ?
We should let the Commission prove that it applied the procedure correctly .
European aid must serve peace .
There should be no question of European money being used to pay for the spreading of racist views .
A formal condemnation is not doing anyone any good .
We are talking conditions , and not just comments .
However , there are still a few matters to be resolved .
This is also clearly brought out in the report , by the way .
I would single out the closure of accounts for special mention in this respect .
Commissioner , this is a matter for you .
I was there myself .
This particularly applies to the already long overdue reform of the disciplinary procedure .
In principle , the answer to this question has long been ' yes ' .
The excuse used was always that the relevant procedures were unclear .
Anyone hoping that this will now change under the reform process has been disappointed so far .
Understand that if you will , because I find it incomprehensible .
Surely this is a reasonable demand ?
I would appreciate your support in this .
There were also shortcomings within the Commission .
A new approach has now been adopted to ensure that discharges are confined to the business of the budget .
However , owing to budgetary neutrality there are to be only 248 new appointments .
Who will qualify for the scheme ?
It is a voluntary scheme .
The second aspect relating to staffing policy concerns the disciplinary procedure .
You have also mentioned this proposal again today .
The Commission is convinced that the same should apply here .
Naturally , there is a need for action .
That much is obvious having viewed the matter objectively .
Only if OLAF answers this in the negative will this bureau take action .
The scenarios can vary a great deal .
I would like to cite an example : sexual harassment in the workplace .
So various areas come to mind .
I think it is an excellent idea to take a complementary approach .
This would demonstrate that the Commission is keen to implement fair and objective disciplinary procedures .
I have just a few more words to say about your critical comments on foreign policy .
Mrs Theato mentioned the need to reduce outstanding commitments .
The European tax payer was willing to deliver aid to the people of Gaza .
It is high time the people were able to make use of it .
Many thanks , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 12 noon .
Special reports of the Court of Auditors
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
, deputising for the rapporteur .
If these rules were observed , the pertinent financial interests would be fully protected .
A number of difficulties arise in this and I shall highlight half a dozen :
First of all , there are no reliable statistics on the volume of guarantees currently granted .
Thirdly , incomplete declarations must be mentioned .
These were the main concerns expressed .
So we look forward to its completion .
The Court of Auditors ' Special Report which is before us , is the third in a series .
I believe that sometimes , it is necessary to visit the relevant location .
That is very important . I would like to reiterate as well as underline this .
What was the criticism about , ladies and gentlemen ?
I gather that this criticism by the Court of Auditors has been acted upon by the European Commission .
All credit to the Commission for this .
Improvements have been made and staffing levels have increased .
So , as far as this is concerned , well done to the Commission .
The European Commission has been blamed for not keeping a close enough eye on it .
I believe that this is an extremely positive result .
Other criticism was expressed with regard to human rights .
A final - important - point I would like to make is the recurring theme of the media policy .
The Commission has come under very strong criticism with regard to its media policy .
I am still waiting for a detailed report from the Commission .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , my report is really a combination of four separate reports .
From this point of view I should like to thank Commissioner Schreyer for attending .
Our Committee took on board all the amendments they presented .
It must be said that the same criticisms are also made of Member States .
There is never sufficient monitoring once projects are underway , either at grass roots or from Brussels .
The Commission is currently engaged in a radical reform of its organisation and is asking for additional resources .
Too often they are treated as donations , funds to be substituted for national funds .
They should hence be used with even more care than national funds .
That concludes my comments .
Thank you , Mr President , for the extra few seconds you allowed me .
The European Union 's annual contribution constitutes 35 % of the total .
We cannot monitor what is going on from behind a desk .
Many of us categorically opposed this as out of the question .
There are clearly a range of areas where the Commission has yet to act to improve matters .
But we cannot stand by and uncritically applaud .
Substantial sums go into these developments .
First of all , there is the Garriga report .
What has the Commission done so far with the recommendations in that report ?
Next , there is the McCartin report on agriculture .
Another point , which is very topical at the moment , is animal disease control .
This is taking a huge chunk out of the European budget .
Could the Commission look into this matter at the earliest opportunity ?
We are delighted about this , and we believe the Staes report is excellent .
Is this having an impact on European aid ?
Finally , I would like to make an observation with regard to the Dell 'Alba report .
This is not desirable in our eyes .
Could something be done about this ?
The European agricultural policy must be given a thorough going over .
BSE is only the tip of the iceberg .
This is very clearly borne out by the McCartin report .
There has to be a fundamental change on this score .
We need more transparency and openness .
Mr McCartin has already mentioned the right key words in his report .
What we are talking about here is the issue of direct aid and cofinancing .
I shall therefore confine my comments to the subjects raised by Mr McCartin and Mr Staes .
This is a decision we think is particularly justifiable , and one that is essential for farmers .
They are clearly not the parties responsible for epizootic disease ; they are its victims .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , I would like to say a few words concerning the excellent report by Mr Staes .
Secondly , this report by Mr Staes raises our hopes in two respects .
Firstly , the Commission is receptive to new ideas .
It shows that our initiatives are valuable and that the Commission is receptive to new ideas .
I believe we should think about the real causes behind this incomprehensible fact .
Perhaps there is a lack of initiatives and the least-favoured areas do not know how to develop .
What is ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , I should above all like to congratulate Mr Staes on a most outstanding report .
His conditions of work were not the best .
The history of the Commission ' s delegations in Bosnia has become a success story .
Many of the problems are due to the projects having previously been administered centrally from Brussels .
Now , the EU delegations on the spot have been given more powers and more staff .
At the same time , the Court of Auditors would like to see tighter control .
I really do not think that this adds up .
The issue of cooperation between the EU and the organisations will become part of the 1999 discharge .
The Commission is calling for clear guidelines from the Council and Parliament .
We merely need to retain a certain degree of control over taxpayers ' money .
Every European citizen contributed more than EUR 37 to the cereals budget in 1997 .
Arable crops represented 43 % of agricultural expenditure but only 10.7 % of final production .
The COM in arable crops provides the greatest argument for the need to reform the CAP .
This will require reform of the current CAP .
This assessment should take account of the variety of routes to employment to be implemented .
We know how difficult it is to reach the whole of a target group with any measure .
( The President cut the speaker off )
It has done such outstanding work .
It has done an outstanding job and I welcome the positive response in the report to it .
There is also the Special Peace Programme from the European Union itself .
There will certainly be a great deal to do in that area .
Over the last few years , the Commission has endeavoured to substantially improve the legal provisions in this area .
The Community Custom ' s Code has just recently been amended and the amendment has entered into force .
Last year , seven Member States were connected up to the new computer-supported transit procedure .
It ought to be the Finance Ministers ' first priority to want to change a system of this kind .
I will now turn now to the extremely important report on agriculture by Mr McCartin .
I would like to express my gratitude for these reports .
The Commission used these measures as the basis for its own assessment .
You also address the important issue of cofinancing of direct aid in the report .
We know what became of this matter in Agenda 2000 .
I will now turn to your report Mr Staes , for which the Commission is in your debt .
You mention the extraordinary circumstances , particularly with regard to the financing of the open broadcasting network .
This relationship is indeed complex .
Further talks and regulations are called for here .
The regulations now provide for a clearer distribution of responsibility between the Commission and the Member States .
Finally , permit me just to say a few words about the report on the PEACE programme .
This programme too was launched under very difficult conditions initially .
Management of European Monetary Institute and European Central Bank ( 1998 )
There is a tiny bit of history behind this report .
On 31 May 1998 the European Monetary Institute changed to the European Central Bank .
The ECB took on all the assets and liabilities of the EMI .
There were two main areas where the Court of Auditors identified problems .
That is a court case that is ongoing .
The other part that the Committee was very interested in was the contradictory procedure .
However , I am sure these problems will not occur in future .
It also pointed to a number of IT problems .
The other point was extraordinary bonuses .
So I went to the ECB and asked for a meeting .
We are simply doing our job .
A number of the problems pointed out in the report are specifically concerned with the transition .
The methods for deciding about this additional cost were also criticised .
The ECB also acknowledges that there has been a lack of clarity surrounding this extra bonus .
Presumably the figures have been misinterpreted .
That is not the point .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken at 12 noon .
Financial assistance to SMEs ( 1999 )
Mr President , I wish to begin by just reminding the House of a few statistics .
I have annexed the detailed timetable to the report .
So that again was not exactly impressive .
However , the Commission did not reply .
We do not understand ! "
Yesterday , I spoke in the debate on the Doorn report on SLIM concerning bureaucracy .
This is just too much micromanagement .
I am not particularly confident but we shall watch to see how that goes .
It is already history .
Mr President , the Nice Summit was characterised by weak decisions .
However , it will not impede progress towards an ever stronger European Union .
When national measures have no effect , that is when Europe comes into play .
We are experiencing this with BSE .
We are also experiencing this with the fight against unemployment .
We concur with his criticism of the Commission for providing too little information too late .
We must also take greater account of the sustainability of services .
Mr President , let us seize on the initiative emanating from Mr Bushill-Matthews ' excellent report .
The more detailed the information , the sooner confidence in EU initiatives will grow .
I am sure there is a shared opinion across this House of how important small businesses are .
So that is very relevant to us in this House too .
It is relevant because of the Lisbon process .
These facilities should be seen very much as being at the heart of trying to achieve those economic goals .
I would also like to change past practice by congratulating Mr Bushill-Matthews .
He has actually come up with something constructive here , so well done Mr Bushill-Matthews .
Congratulations to you for supporting that .
I would have liked to see more on the social economy .
They should not be treated differently ; they should be given extra help .
Perhaps the Commission could comment on that at the close of the debate .
I would also like to particularly support Amendment No 3 from the Socialist Group .
Mr President , I want first of all to congratulate Mr Bushill-Matthews on his report .
Moreover , every politician has a soft spot for small and medium-sized enterprises .
The rapporteur puts forward the proposal that enterprises that have not taken up support programmes should be interviewed .
I consulted numerous colleagues on this , in my capacity as owner of a medium-sized enterprise .
There are also a few things wrong with the organisation of the ASAP on the policy side .
The growth and environmental initiative has not received any more funds .
What is more , it strives for a completely antiquated after-care style of environmental protection .
This has , until now , not been the case .
The great majority of them are firms employing at most 10 employees .
The traditional sector should also be able to benefit in full .
I am thinking in particular of the craft sector , which provides employment , know-how and innovation .
From this point of view , I support the programme of start-up facilities for smallSMEs .
We have now proved the superiority of the economic system of free initiative .
Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating Mr Bushill-Matthews on this major report .
Mr President , I am delighted that this report has been put before the House .
What steps can we take , particularly as regards agriculture ?
There is still too much hesitancy on this score for my liking .
This report concerns the first annual report on the Growth and Employment Initiative .
However , a re-shaping of the financial instruments of the initiative cannot be done annually .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken at 12 noon .
This brings me to a remark which I would like to make vis-à-vis the European Commission .
I have no axe to grind with the European Commission .
The Council must do something about this ; Parliament has codecision rights on this dossier .
Court judgments have been passed on this .
This is another area where politicians have let themselves down .
That is shocking .
I know that the outcome of this was thought to be unpleasant .
The position of active frontier workers , but also that of post-active frontier workers is at stake here .
It impacts on the day-to-day running of the market , also with regard to the candidate countries .
I would therefore call for the broadest support possible .
These are problems which cause the people to question the raison d ' être of the European Union .
Luxembourg firms are fighting against additional expenditure and additional costs , and so jobs are at risk .
This is why people decline the office of mayor .
The list goes on .
We have achieved a great deal , but there is still much to be done .
The report by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten illustrates the legitimate demands of the people in the border regions .
It has to be said : not a great deal has happened legislatively speaking over the past three years .
We have often said that border regions are good barometers for European integration .
As a result , frontier workers continue to be at the receiving end of this unsatisfactory situation .
We must therefore look for creative solutions .
I would like to mention two .
Secondly , we must have the courage to take the conclusions reached in 1998 a little further .
I think there is a whole raft of arguments in favour of the country of employment .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Oomen for the huge amount of work she has done .
Despite this , I have some observations in this respect , which is also apparent from my amendments .
Whether this is Germany or Belgium , they cross the border at any rate .
I agree with this position and I have also told Mrs Oomen .
Mrs Oomen takes the country of employment as the guiding principle .
I am of the opinion that we work to live and not the other way round .
I have included the above in an amendment .
I would therefore ask my fellow MEPs to vote in favour of this amendment .
We have to find a way of simplifying things for citizens themselves and for the administrators of these systems .
The debate is suspended until 3 p.m.
We shall now proceed to the vote .
Mr President , on a point of order .
I hope everybody has heard that .
Thank you , Mrs Banotti , for looking after the interests of non-smokers .
Mr President , on a point of order .
Mr President , on a point of order .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
That concludes the vote .
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Peijs recommendation for second reading ( A5-0369 / 2000 )
Mr President , I was afraid I was going to have to make my explanations of vote in writing .
This is unacceptable .
This , to my mind , is reason enough to reject this report .
They are the ones that should be compensated first and foremost for the loss of their jobs .
Sanders-ten Holte recommendation for second reading ( A5-0375 / 2000 )
Mr President , I voted for the Sanders-ten Holte report .
These universities are , of course , frequented by many elderly people .
He said to me : " Many universities are poorly organised , but ours is well organised .
The reality is that new information technologies are changing all the time .
Currently , 18 countries participate in the Erasmus programme , including countries from Eastern and Central Europe .
Approximately 90 000 students benefit from this initiative on an annual basis .
Still students are encountering financial problems while studying abroad .
De Veyrac report ( A5-0382 / 2000 )
A great deal still remains to be done , but we are on the right track .
That is why I voted in favour .
Mr President , I voted against this report .
And why did the Pensioners ' Party vote against Mrs de Veyrac 's report ?
It ' s not the quantity but the quality of sites that counts .
It is hardly our fault that Italy has so many ancient monuments to preserve " .
The ELDR amendments to the de Veyrac report reflect this position .
That is unacceptable .
It is obvious , however , that classifying sites as world heritage sites is not enough .
The de Veyrac report is a laudable contribution towards this .
Doorn report ( A5-0351 / 2000 )
Thank you Mr Fatuzzo .
We are therefore abstaining from the vote on this report .
van der Laan report ( A5-0397 / 2000 )
Mr President , I voted for the van der Laan report .
I would say that this is a technical problem .
We must be firm on this issue .
Our conscience will not allow anything else , nor will our electorate .
The EU is , among other things , providing aid to the Palestinian education system .
This amendment raises a new issue on evidence that has recently come to light .
Garriga Polledo report ( A5-0331 / 2000 )
We in the EU must respond to this problem as a matter of urgency .
They have links to that organisation .
What better way to discharge the ministerial portfolio than to encourage their friends to stop this activity .
It also underlines a greater need for widespread policing in Northern Ireland .
Mr President , I voted for this report but with great reservations .
I said : " It is such an enjoyable job !
I am content , I feel at ease and I have some very good friends .
He continued : " And is everything working alright in Europe ?
You don 't find yourselves wasting European money every now and again ? "
" No " , I replied , " everything is working fine . "
There are , however , a few points from which we would disassociate ourselves .
First of all , this is unclearly formulated .
What we do support is establishing the necessary instruments for combating fraud involving EU funds more effectively .
The unit must only concern itself with crimes committed by EU employees .
McCartin report ( A5-0396 / 2000 )
People are saying that it might be possible to contract mad cow disease by drinking milk .
This report is deeply contradictory in its assessment of various aspects of the CAP .
Staes report ( A5-0389 / 2000 )
We pensioners need to receive some of them ! "
Dell 'Alba report ( A5-0359 / 2000 )
European funds must not be tied to national funds .
Europe is a separate entity from its constituent nations .
This in itself constitutes a valuable contribution to agricultural policy .
This requires motivated producers .
Heaton Harris report ( A5-0395 / 2000 )
I therefore trust that my recommendation will be acted upon .
The report by Mr Heaton-Harris confuses two issues .
We will vote in support of the report by Mr Heaton-Harris for this reason .
Bushill-Matthews report ( A5-0335 / 2000 )
A number of observations on the substance of the specific programmes bears out the general comments made above :
That concludes the explanations of vote .
( The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Frontier workers ( continuation )
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the situation of frontier workers .
Mr President , I want first of all to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for an excellent report .
That is quite intolerable if we are to have a common Öresund region .
I think that would put an end to tax avoidance and to cheating in frontier regions .
Only in that way will long-lasting solutions be obtained .
In my opinion , this report is a real booster shot in relation to previous reports .
We should at least ensure that there is no need to produce many more reports .
Mr President , I should also like to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for her own-initiative report .
I think it only right that we in Parliament make efforts to reduce the problems experienced by frontier workers .
I think this illustrates how major the obstacles in practice are .
I should also like to support the view that we should do more to simplify Regulation 1408 / 71 .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to make a few observations following on from this dossier .
First of all , I would like to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for the work she has done .
It is good that we should not forget frontier workers and their problems .
The Commission fully supports your concerns as regards the problems encountered by frontier workers .
I therefore welcome your proposal to forward the resolution to the Council .
Allow me to now set out briefly the Commission 's approach to the points raised in the resolution .
This is an excellent idea and advantage can be taken of the experience accumulated under the Eures network .
This initiative will complement the already existing directive in this field , which was adopted in 1998 .
These questions concern hospital care and the Dutch health system .
The Commission will await the outcome of these judgments before taking a position .
On 9 November 2000 the Education Council adopted its common position on this proposal .
The Commission is not sure that it would be appropriate to propose such a legislative instrument .
Finally , my comments on tax .
Unlike social security , there is no Community legislation at all on personal taxation .
Indeed Member States are extremely protective of their sovereignty in this area .
That is particularly true of their competence to enter into bilateral tax treaties .
Unfortunately this will not change following the Treaty of Nice .
Thank you Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The debate will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
We are adopting legislation that appears to fill this need .
We have found that the habitats directive is locked in controversy and law suits .
What can be done about this ?
And did the German Government , in fact , vote against that directive originally ?
Certainly the cost of clean-up laws must be taken into account when a law is adopted .
We suspect that the same thing will happen with the national emissions ceiling directive .
We will continue to pursue this idea in two years time when the issue should return to us .
The public tends to complain to us , not to the Environment Council .
Mr President , first of all I thank Mrs Jackson for her important question .
We have a number of tools at our disposal to improve implementation .
We can take legal measures to follow up implementation .
Of course , I acknowledge that there is still much to be done .
We have to look for new ways to encourage the proper transposition and application of environmental legislation .
For example , we need to work to improve the involvement of people at the local and regional level .
I have been very clear from the beginning that I will put more emphasis on implementation .
The same problem applies to the directive on PCBs .
We also have a situation , however , in which a degree of impunity reigns .
This can give companies a competitive edge .
In my opinion , there are three fundamental questions .
Lastly , Mr President , the process must be speeded up .
Mr President , the aim of these directives is to protect the environment .
Consequently , campaigns , such as those designed to monitor compliance involving independent inspectorates , are essential .
As everyone has pointed out , we have the legislation .
The problem lies in incorporating and applying this legislation .
They are very positive and clear commitments to do something about this very serious problem .
Sadly our own Environment Agency does not appear to be up to the job yet .
We can but hope .
So what solutions do we have ?
What can Parliamentarians do ?
Well , these three reports before Parliament today are a start .
They name and shame .
They call for fines .
They make proposals for further improvement .
But , they also make a point which we must take on board here in Parliament .
They say essentially that bad legislation should never have been put on the statute book .
And that is a lesson that we have to take to heart .
Perhaps we have to start to think about doing less but better .
We have talked about doing it but seemingly not done so yet .
When we put better legislation on the agenda in future , it has to be respected .
We owe it to those future generations to pursue this issue .
It was poor legislation .
A great number of farmers use artificial fertiliser ; how is that measured ?
What is the impact of sewage leaks , for example ?
What is the impact of major rivers discharging into other countries ?
I share the view of all the speakers who say that we must adopt sound environmental policy .
They did not appreciate how far-reaching it really was .
This is one of the most important explanations for why progress has been so slow .
However , the fact that progress has been slow does not mean that nothing is happening .
I believe there is a lot to be learned from this .
Nor can we see a reversal of this trend .
I would like to comment on two directives today .
What do these two directives have in common ?
It is the Netherlands itself which decided to do so .
The same applies to the habitats directive .
But forced mating is something which does not work , even in the animal kingdom .
Mr President , poor compliance with environmental legislation is a huge problem .
We must also consider the quality and nature of the legislation we produce .
The Union is growing ever bigger and more diverse .
We must therefore lay down rules which can thrive in the different national cultures .
That is why I think we should prescribe less detail .
An example of sound legislation is the habitats directive .
The environment is a common legacy ; environmental protection a common task .
The habitats directive prescribes a clear goal .
The way in which it is to be achieved is quite flexible .
There are instances of incorrect application .
The significant implications of this would then be compensation and major public interest .
The very strength of the habitats directive lies in its flexibility .
The directive stands for a modern way of protecting the environment .
I would like to thank Mrs Jackson for raising the question .
But what do we see happening ? Two camps are forming .
But it really is not that simple and , of course , we have criticised your methods sometimes .
I can understand to an extent , why you took the line you did .
There are various reasons as to why countries have trouble transposing this legislation .
Nature simply will not allow it .
When we were in Toulouse , we saw how local people are trying to transpose it .
But basically , they do not know what is going on .
They do not know where the boundaries are , or how to apply them properly .
These are shortcomings that must be reviewed as a matter of priority .
Speedier sanctions and careful drafting of laws will enable us to solve this problem .
In all modesty , I am thinking , for example , of the Nordic countries .
I was pleased to hear Mrs Wallström ' s remarks on the reports .
The same applies to a great deal of other legislation .
And this is legislation which we need for the future .
In doing so it , in turn , must rely on information supplied to it by the Member States .
I should therefore like to ask the Commission if it now has sufficient resources .
Mind you , Parliament cannot talk , because we are constantly calling for reports .
In other words , we all have to think where we can make improvements .
I should therefore be grateful for your support .
Finally , I should like to mention one more point , namely the candidate countries .
We require candidate countries to adopt European legislation .
And right now they know full well that they are simply and deliberately contravening European legislation .
Some members are saying that we should name and shame .
We are being accused unfairly here .
The list is long , the list of the failure of my own country to transpose EU environmental law .
We are second worst in terms of transposition and designation of sites under the habitats directive .
That is the first step : reply to the letters of the Commission .
No government should be forgiven bad manners and inappropriate behaviour .
No joy , no progress , perhaps even no response - I do not know .
This is on a local pilgrimage path .
Changing the essential balance between human activity and our environment led to the loss of this precious ecosystem .
We have to live and earn a living in these places .
Equally we cannot continue to mortgage our children 's health and heritage .
Mr President , I should like again to thank all the Members of the European Parliament for their statements .
I could not agree more with most of what you have said , except for any accusation of complacency .
We could do more on that .
We could do more with the use of indicators because we have to measure .
We have to be better at assessing the results of compliance with environmental legislation .
They have to give us answers and provide us with information .
We do not have the means to send people to all the Member States to check .
We cannot do that unless you give me another 500 people .
What we have to do is modernise legislation .
It has been said that we need less but better legislative proposals .
I agree with that .
We know this from some of the Member States .
We have to draw on that .
We can do more on education and information .
We have started activities like this .
We try to use all these available instruments to improve implementation .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Wednesday , at 12 noon .
Young farmers in the Union
We have reached a point where it has become vital to take action in order to stop this decline .
Not only for the sake of agriculture itself , but also to safeguard existing structures in our countryside .
I have , however , tried not to reinvent the wheel .
We are living in a computer age .
There is greater emphasis on organic production throughout Europe .
There is a great need to assist some of the older farmers to retire in dignity .
This trend must be reversed .
Young farmers need greater access to production rights .
In many parts of the world , share farming is a common practice .
The results have been varied , with some positive aspects but with many other negative aspects .
This effect is significantly magnified by quota systems and by production-limiting schemes .
Revisiting the Mansholt Plan would be a good place to start .
Many thanks indeed go to him , then .
In this short speech I would like to focus attention on a couple of points .
The report takes excellent account of the problems of young farmers . Social problems are dealt with particularly well .
The problem that has come about is what is referred to as the hundred-hectare solitude factor .
In agriculture we need sustainability , especially with regard to change-of-generation factors .
The average age of European farmers is worryingly high .
It must be financially feasible to sustain the change-of-generation system .
Young people must be induced to start farming .
There are not enough young starters , however .
The EU can and must promote policies that work as incentives for the young .
Bureaucracy must not become a barrier to improving the position of young farmers .
The requirement for very large cultivated areas , even in island regions , is a typical example .
This requirement becomes prohibitive when combined with quotas .
Efforts must be concentrated on providing support - moral , educational and financial .
After all , young farmers hold the key to the future of all our rural communities .
I stress that farms are also important employers in our rural communities .
Employment protects our countryside , it keeps our post offices , schools and services open there .
Young farmers are the future of the farming industry and vital components in urban communities .
How can we help them ?
I would like to thank Mr Parish for his excellent work .
Young farmers do indeed need urgent attention .
This in itself constitutes a valuable contribution to agricultural policy .
This requires motivated producers .
If we want farming to have a future in Europe , then we must secure its succession .
The agricultural policy and the policy for the countryside as a whole lives for and from its inhabitants .
I think this is a very constructive own-initiative report .
The numbers alone should set our alarm bells ringing .
The number of farms in the EU has fallen constantly over recent years .
The biggest decrease has been in the number of farmers under the age of 35 .
The tradition of handing farms down from one generation to the next is disappearing .
The question of what becomes of the older generation left on the farm is often still unanswered .
How many young people want to have to keep making excuses because they are farmers ?
Young farmers want fair prices for their products .
It is not because of the subsidies that they choose to be farmers .
The Parish report may help to improve the overall image of young farmers .
The public pays scant attention to the services of farming .
But apparently bad news makes better news .
At the moment , you can read about the current BSE crisis blow by blow .
We have set standards .
So-called ' good professional practice ' has been continually developed by our excellently trained young farmers .
It is an indication of the concern of this particular group for the problem we are discussing .
It was the parish plan .
However , we should not imagine that this was an ideal world in which to live .
If it were not for the common agricultural policy , that would have been very painful .
Today we need more quality and we need to consider the environment .
All these are things Mr Parish has underlined .
Mr President , could I begin by congratulating Mr Parish on bringing forward a very excellent report .
Of course , everybody likes to say we must help the young farmers .
How can you encourage young people onto the land ?
You have to address the problem within the situation in which young people find themselves today .
Nowadays those young people have many other options open to them .
But the young farmer will work seven days a week for very little money .
It is not enough to introduce it in one Member State alone .
Young farmers have computers .
Farmers ' wives know how to use computers and could use them on the farm .
That is the way forward for the future .
All of this begs the question : what can the European Union do ?
Why should they face an anti-social life ?
That is the problem we have to address and we must address it now .
I should also like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for its work .
Measures to promote rural development are particularly important here .
The Member States are responsible for deciding what priority should be given to promoting young farmers .
What we do need is for the assessments in question to be made available .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Fischler .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Question Time ( Commission )
Question No 25 by ( H-0962 / 00 )
Firstly , there will be a proposal on common definitions , incriminations and sanctions for crimes involving terrorism .
Secondly fast-track extradition procedures between Member States will be introduced .
But what is the problem , Commissioner ?
I wish to begin by saying that I share Mr Mollar ' s sense of urgency .
Urgency is indeed crucial in this matter .
That is urgency is most vital .
Question No 26 by ( H-0975 / 00 ) :
These proposals will take account of the specific circumstances of women who have been victims of abuse and mistreatment .
As they deal with the same subject , Questions Nos 27 and 28 will be taken together .
Question No 27 by ( H-0969 / 00 ) :
Subject : European chemical industry The carbohydrates industry employs some 8 500 people .
What will the Commission do to reverse this trend ?
Question No 28 by ( H-0977 / 00 )
I fail to see why any additional aid should be needed .
We cannot simply extend the quotas .
Question No 29 by ( H-0003 / 01 )
There is still great uncertainty surrounding compensation for the losses incurred .
If not , why is the Commission against a coordinated approach ?
A special culling regulation for animals over thirty months old has also been introduced .
Commissioner , all of this is , of course , music to my ears .
All I can see is a great deal of chaos and insecurity in my country .
Your response in this matter is somewhat disappointing , in my opinion .
They cannot expect the European Commission to do it for them .
But it is also the job and the responsibility of the individual Member States to announce regional measures .
Questions to Mrs Wallström
Question No 30 by ( H-0972 / 00 ) :
In Chile , demands have been made for the waste to be shipped back to Sweden .
This regulation replaced Directive 84 / 631 on the transfrontier shipment of hazardous waste .
Thank you for your answer .
The answer to that question is yes .
Question No 31 by ( H-0973 / 00 ) :
The Spanish Minister for the Environment has confirmed his commitment to this consultation .
You have already identified some of the directives affected by this .
If there were a breach of the environmental legislation , we could actually withhold project money .
This has , until now , been the opinion shared by almost all Spanish political groups over the years .
True , that proposal contained an appreciably larger number of infrastructures than the current project .
We make sure that we are well informed about what is happening in Spain .
Question No 32 by ( H-1002 / 00 ) :
The Commission also regrets the environmental and economic damage caused by fires .
The Commission believes that it is very important to coordinate fire safety issues .
There may still be certain weaknesses when it comes to coordinating fire safety issues .
I really must thank you for your answer .
Obviously , a good deal of progress has nonetheless been made in this area .
The principle of subsidiarity must , of course , apply in this area , just as in other areas .
Just like the public , they are , in fact , affected more and more by cross-border factors .
Local authorities can never manage on their own .
Have you considered this as an idea which could be promoted with good results ?
As the honourable Member points out , these issues of civil protection and civil defence are very important .
It is precisely that kind of service which ought to be looked into .
Where is it to be found ?
How shall we be able to mobilise it quickly when it is needed ?
And how can we train ourselves to be able to react still more quickly ?
The plan and the proposal already exist .
We also have to coordinate our emergency teams .
I believe we have made some good progress .
It is now also a question of allocating enough resources to make the plan really work in practice .
Question No 33 by ( H-0001 / 01 ) :
The resulting situation is posing a serious ecological problem and greatly inconveniencing those entitled to use the land .
What technical and financial measures will the Commission take to halt this nuisance ?
Mr President , this question concerns the primrose willow .
I listened closely and I would like to thank you for your answer .
It would be very radical to try to ban a certain plant .
That cannot be done .
Any action and any plans have to start at local level .
Mr President , we are always so surprised when the balance of nature is upset .
I wish I could answer that question .
That is the only advice I can give today .
Questions to Mrs de Palacio
Question No 34 by ( H-0955 / 00 ) :
This British regulatory body recently published a revised interim report on the progress made by BNFL .
Following the February recommendations , the Commission ' s services are also studying this second interim report .
However , I cannot agree that compliance with 3 out of 20 recommendations is progress .
Clearly they have not been complied with in full .
I would ask you to study that in full also , Mrs de Palacio .
Commissioner Patten rather surprisingly replied that this was not a priority .
Question No 35 by ( H-0960 / 00 ) :
To this end , the review of trans-European networks will be carried out in two stages .
The Commission will present a communication to show how these guidelines have been taken into account .
That part of my question has not been answered .
The major part - the investments - corresponds to large rail projects .
Question No 36 by ( H-0963 / 00 ) :
Civil society is rejecting the promotion of nuclear power as an alternative to fossil fuels .
Is the Commission considering increasing the proportion of energy consumption supplied by nuclear power ?
If so , up to what level ?
How does it think it will be able to finance the development of renewable energy ?
How does it plan to use nuclear industry profits as an additional source of funding for renewable energy ?
Questions to Mr Nielson
Let this be quite clear .
At the moment , unfortunately , the problem of climate change is absolutely out of control .
I share your concern .
Thank you , Commissioner .
I have two other points .
It is for the Member States to decide whether they will build or not build nuclear power plants .
Will the Commissioner disassociate herself from those comments ?
In other words , I fully agree with you , and I say so plainly in the Green Paper .
Secondly , waste as such is not renewable energy .
Waste incineration by itself cannot be a renewable energy .
But if you just say waste and that is all , then I will say no .
Mr President , on a point of order . I want an answer to my question .
You passed over my Question 39 .
I am here to take the question .
I must request the answer to that question .
There are three questions in one in Question 40 , which will take another 20 minutes or so .
I am entitled to that .
Question No 40 by ( H-0959 / 00 ) :
The Cotonou Agreement specifically mentions the increasing role of non-State actors in the development process .
Situations change and so does the pattern of how we distribute through different partners .
We will make the kind of response to this problem that we have presented for the CLONG so far .
That recovery normally also leads to a stop in the funding of the recipient in question .
This is normal procedure .
But here I am on clear ground .
But if some sort of reconstruction is necessary , this is a phase they may have to go through .
Question No 41 by ( H-0971 / 00 ) :
World Mission Germany is carrying out this programme .
We are concerned here with a total of 300 000 refugees out of a population of 10 million people .
I also want to highlight the gravity of the situation for the Christian minority in Indonesia .
I assume you are following developments there very closely .
We are careful to avoid this further problem .
There are a number of conflicts within Indonesia .
They are not all of the same character .
Here there is the basis of relatively good cooperation with the Government of Indonesia .
Question No 42 by ( H-0981 / 00 ) :
The overall number of refugees in Tanzania , including those from Burundi , continues to grow .
ECHO 's level of support is expected to remain substantially the same this year .
But , of course , this is what we are going to support .
At this stage , the preconditions for an orderly and voluntary repatriation unfortunately are not met .
This is a major operation of ours and we want to follow it through to a successful conclusion .
Question No 43 by ( H-0984 / 00 ) :
Peace and democratic stability are indispensable preconditions for economic and social progress .
Conflict prevention is an integral part of the EU 's external policy objectives .
The Commission has already had numerous discussions with the Swedish Presidency and we share their concerns .
We really need better instruments in these fields , of course .
The Commission will present a communication on conflict prevention this spring .
It is fully aware of the crucial role of development cooperation in this context .
That is not so easy .
That concludes Questions to the Commission .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.20 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
Common fisheries policy
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
That is what I should like to ask you , Mr President .
Thank you very much .
Mr Nogueira Román may take the floor .
I think it is entirely appropriate .
Mr Nogueira , our working conditions are lamentable in general .
We are trying to improve them so that the debates can be conducted more correctly .
You are aware that there is a working document by the Bureau to discuss this subject .
Mr Cunha has the floor .
We must understand this .
I therefore think that it would make sense to arrange the debate as I have suggested .
Thank you , Mr Cunha .
So , Mr Fischler , the floor is yours .
We have done a great deal of constructive work and numerous details have been clarified .
It was therefore agreed that we should resume negotiations at a technical level as quickly as possible .
Thank you , Commissioner .
First , Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna .
Mr President , thank you very much for your understanding .
We all knew they would be difficult and lengthy .
We have to recognise the global importance that fishing now has .
I want to thank Mr Poignant for his cooperation while producing my report .
This report reviews the years 1996 to 1998 .
This , of course , is to be welcomed .
I regret the present unsatisfactory state of fish stocks in relation to technical conservation measures .
I believe that more progress can still be made .
I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna on his report .
Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna has outlined to us in detail the importance of the multi-functional role of the EU fisheries .
The Commission must come up with appropriate negotiation proposals .
I also want to congratulate my colleague Mr Cunha on his report .
With regard to the form of proceedings , the method of the report was discussed .
Some Members would have preferred not to examine the subject in too much depth .
At the moment , two main schools of thought are discernible .
That is the guiding principle .
Perhaps Mr Gallagher and I have given the impression that we are repeating ourselves .
Politics involves repeating oneself and contradicting oneself .
We have opted to repeat ourselves .
We see now , however , that these cards were not played .
Let us now proceed to the subject of my report , which is Guinea ­ Bissau .
It gives me special pleasure , Commissioner Fischler , to be able to welcome you here today .
The new year is a time of hope and expectation , especially for our fishermen .
I am afraid that there is still no light at the end of that particular tunnel .
The next round of financial compensation for Spanish and Portuguese fishermen is coming up .
Mr Gallagher addresses this particular point in his report .
But first I should like to thank Pat Gallagher for his excellent report .
As I am sure you are all aware , a huge programme of work awaits us .
In any case , I think we should not slacken in our efforts .
Mr President , I thank Mr Fischler for having come before this House .
But I am not one to blame you .
Such are the doubts and vacillations that the sector feels at the moment .
We are requesting clear legal and scientific opinions on access restrictions .
Our amendments support keeping the current 6 / 12 mile zone .
I speak specifically of the issue of regional management of the common fisheries policy .
I hope that the Commission will take the results of this work very seriously indeed .
Let us use the opportunities arising from the review of the CFP to achieve a solution which works .
I think the excellent Varela report points out corrective measures for these negative effects .
I should also like to congratulate Mr Cunha .
Because they are disadvantaged areas , restructuring activities stand very little chance of success .
Things cannot go on like this .
My first point concerns access to waters and to internal resources .
Maintaining the traditional activities of every fishing community should be one of the European Union ' s main concerns .
The principle of relative stability is a fundamental pillar of the common fisheries policy .
My third point relates to the role of the European Union on the international stage .
It is impossible to simultaneously satisfy both the market and industry while conserving resources .
European fishermen are active in very different waters .
This requires a regional approach which is entirely in compliance with the European Union ' s principle of subsidiarity .
Do all Member States benefit proportionately from spending Community funding in this way ?
I doubt it very much .
Too many fishermen are chasing too few fish .
The situation in the North Sea is of particular concern .
Savage cuts in the total allowable catches and quotas were announced in December by the Council .
I hope that this debate may bring them to their senses .
This question has stirred the emotions of everyone involved in fisheries for some time now .
The Poignant and Gallagher reports are important milestones in the preliminary debate .
A great many demands have been made on the Commission .
I think it is still too early for the European Parliament to commit itself one way or another .
I should like to single out just three of these basic problems .
Secondly : regionalisation is another catchword which repeatedly gives rise to controversial debate .
But regionalisation does not mean some form of renationalisation .
We have a common fisheries policy in the EU and that is how it is going to stay .
Mr President , European Union fisheries policy is a vast subject .
It is essential that we remain as integrated as possible .
In other countries there are also suggestions .
This can only be good for debate .
I look forward to debating this on future Tuesdays in Strasbourg .
Europe should definitely invest in this .
The latest Euro-barometer data shows scepticism is rising , perhaps as a true reflection of this inability to negotiate .
In the agreement with Morocco they have had no weight whatsoever .
Well , then , Morocco-European Union relations must be seriously affected .
All the funds poured into this agreement should be used to finance alternatives in the areas affected .
Meanwhile , the Commission Presidency is trying to settle a very long-standing problem at the last minute .
Adaptation to a global economy has had varying effects on the fisheries sector .
Like every other economic activity , fisheries are affected by globalisation .
I fully endorse much of what you say in your report and in the resolution attached to it .
I particularly welcome your support in the fight against illegal and irresponsible fishing .
We shall have an opportunity to discuss Community solutions to this burning issue .
But I can already see that you , too , are in favour of a more resolute approach here .
I think that we need further discussion on three points in the report .
That would be counterproductive , both for fish stocks and for jobs .
Fisheries needs to stand on their own two feet .
Secondly , I should like to comment on the WTO negotiations which you mention .
That brings me to the reports and motions for resolutions from Mr Gallagher and Mr Poignant .
Both reports start from the same premise .
The fisheries sector in the Community is under equal pressure from several quarters .
The Commission therefore agrees to the motions for resolutions on several points .
This brings me to Mr Cunha 's report on Guinea-Bissau .
I am delighted that the rapporteur supports our proposal .
This will help the Community fleet to make better use of the agreement .
Finally , a brief word on the proposed amendments .
Negotiations were held practically every day in Rabat between 2 January and 9 January .
We really have done our utmost here .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
The next item is the joint debate on :
Mr President , Bangladesh is rich and poor at the same time .
Rich in human resources , poor in capital means .
It is regularly afflicted by natural disasters .
This is why it is important for Europe to give as much aid as possible .
We should not disappoint them in this expectation , and make every effort to promote positive developments .
Abused women accounted for more than 30 % of the patients in a hospital we visited .
Mass-scale political strikes regularly bring life in Bangladesh to a standstill .
Foreign investment is only possible if the government ensures more peaceful social conditions .
There is also instability politically speaking .
The opposition must resume its constructive role .
In principle , the European Union can provide valuable aid to help alleviate all of these problems .
Reinforcement of the government apparatus should take centre stage in aid provision .
The state is functioning ineffectively in very many ways , especially in the finance and education sectors .
Often , funds only become available after long delays , it at all .
The delegation is not sufficiently involved in defining the programme .
The shortage of personnel leads to a lack of supervision in projects .
The many non-governmental organisations which are present fulfil a key role in the implementation of programmes .
But the advantage outweighs the disadvantage .
Neither the Land Commission nor the Regional Council were functioning .
The military presence has not let up .
My conclusion is that the country should not be as poor as it is now .
Mothers now have three children instead of seven .
This is the most heavily populated of the so-called ' less-developed countries ' .
And as if this were not enough , there are also the terrible disasters that constantly afflict the country .
As you all know , the European Union is Bangladesh ' s main trading partner .
Around 45 % of that country ' s exports come to the European Union .
Mr van den Bos has already mentioned them in his speech .
We went there after the UNCTAD conference in Bangkok .
I wanted to go to a non-ACP LDC country to start in the right place .
So this is all very good
If this is what we finally decide to do , we think it may be very useful .
I clarified this when I was there in February last year .
Many innovations have taken place there .
Microcredit is a great achievement and it is not only one very famous organisation that has been successful .
But the rapporteur said something which struck me , as did Mrs Maes .
I believe that this is fundamentally a credit to the people and indeed to the Government of Bangladesh .
Europe has the know-how to prevent the deforestation .
But we can , I believe , and we must do more .
The future of Bangladesh also depends on its youth .
We must encourage them to do so .
There are three points I should like to emphasise in addition to the general need for aid and development .
There is the need for good governance and support for democracy .
Others have touched upon these , so I shall not comment further upon them .
However , I should like to emphasise our need to make further progress now .
This cooperation is good news and to be encouraged and supported .
I have to say I do not see the same positive approach on the part of the Burmese authorities .
In the past , such actions have resulted in military action .
This represents a huge push factor for emigration including to the European Union .
This is recognised in the declaration attached to the cooperation agreement .
I trust the Commission will also attach importance to this .
But we will use IT in all possible applications .
So we should be open to these possibilities .
I agree very much with what Mr van Orden said about the regional aspects .
There are some eleven million Bangladeshi living illegally in India .
Let me once again thank you for this very positive debate .
I look forward to working with Parliament on our relations with Bangladesh .
So we are also looking forward to that partnership .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
( The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m. )
Use of depleted uranium in Bosnia and Kosovo ( Balkan syndrome )
I shall give the floor to the President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Danielsson straightaway .
It is a concern which must be taken with the greatest seriousness .
The issue ought to be investigated by organisations and institutions with competence within this area .
The EU countries which take part in these missions do so on the basis of national decisions .
I therefore share the anxiety expressed regarding the health of all these people .
I am sure they will make every effort to help clarify the situation .
This is the question we have to answer .
In time , those symptoms would develop in a similar way , and the outcome would also be similar .
Furthermore , if we are to assess the facts , we must have access to all the information available .
We must make a particular point of fostering openness and transparency amongst ourselves .
Our work is indeed inspired by this spirit .
Obviously they must also characterise relationships between governments in the region .
So much then , for information .
We must not shy away from it .
( Applause and protests )
That is what we tried to do .
And I should like to remind you ...
We must not forget our starting point .
Let us not forget what we have achieved .
That is what the scientific committees are saying .
Thank you for your attention .
( Applause and protests )
Especially as Mr Solana has thrown part of the blame on to the European Parliament .
You must give a reply here .
I shall give the floor straight away to Mrs Wallström , to speak on behalf of the Commission .
This combines action on the one hand to address immediate problems with longer term assistance .
Let me set out briefly what we have been doing .
This provides a framework in which environmental actions can be pursued at regional level in the Balkans .
Our watchword must be " openness " .
That is why it is essential to proceed rationally and on the basis of scientific evidence .
What then are the facts ?
Uranium itself , as you know , is a radioactive and toxic element that occurs in several minerals .
Depleted uranium is less radioactive than natural uranium .
It is readily available as a by-product of the nuclear fuel cycle and it is very hard and self-sharpening .
We expect that the results of their examinations will be known in March this year .
In their opinion the experts will be expected to draw upon all available scientific evidence .
We expect to have the scientific opinion of the independent experts within a month from now .
Those who bear political and military responsibility also deserve our appreciation .
Let me state that here categorically on behalf of my group .
To this end , various initiatives have already been undertaken at national and international level .
I should like to thank Mr Solana for promising that all information will be published .
It did in fact produce results and paved the way for democracy in the Balkans .
We did not receive any answer at that time .
I think that is worth pointing out .
I feel even more doubtful when I hear the statements of the current NATO representatives .
There are a number of points which I should like to clarify .
I think this is necessary .
It is too early to say .
It is approximately 20 % less radioactive than natural uranium .
It is a by-product of nuclear processing and must accordingly be treated as waste .
In this instance we are talking about a concentration that is 4,000 time greater .
Either there is a problem here , of necessity , or I have failed to understand this European directive .
Mr Solana , I must tell you that the end does not justify the means .
( Applause ) .There is no one in this House that supported the Milosevic regime .
( Applause )
True merit is recognised when one ' s back is against the wall .
It brings the Fifteen face-to-face with their responsibilities in a spectacular fashion .
There is , firstly , the human aspect of the problem .
These people include military personnel and many civilians .
We are clearly faced with a situation of this type in the Balkans .
In the past , the international community has done itself credit by prohibiting anti-personnel mines on these grounds .
It should now , by the same token , ban weapons containing depleted uranium .
I am thinking of the horrific effects of the Gulf War on the Iraqi people , particularly the children .
This , Mr Solana , has nothing to do with defending human rights .
No , as far as Europe is concerned , the end must not justify the means .
Today is one stage in the process , and it will be followed by other stages .
I hope that increasing numbers of us will align ourselves with this move for change .
( Applause )
That is what we hope for from the Council and from you .
You conceded very little .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Madam President , we need to establish the facts in this case .
If he is going to reply to this debate , Mr Solana might like to address that point .
We have to fight terrible wars against terrible people .
( Applause from the right )
And yet that is what we are doing today .
That is not our subject today .
We have a different subject to discuss .
We know today that there are numerous cases of leukaemia .
Surely nothing less than a moratorium on this ammunition would be an acceptable decision for us to take today .
( Applause )
So the risks involved were known prior to the Gulf War .
Did the governments and the military know ?
If so , why were soldiers not given warnings in a similar way ?
Why are you now saying today that the alliance did not have any proof of risk ?
Nobody knows how many more will fall ill in those regions .
Who will provide them with a convincing answer tomorrow ?
The ban on the use of depleted uranium will be the only measure which can restore confidence .
I am calling on the British government to make a full statement on the matter .
It is up to the British government to make a statement on these matters .
Do you take us for fools ?
All we know is that the incidence of leukaemia among our soldiers is abnormally high .
We do not support the call for a moratorium .
It would be inappropriate to engage in such a debate .
There is the risk that in this way , the political debate tips over into a scientific one .
First of all , the European Union ' s responsibility is towards the local population .
It is up to the Member States to assume responsibility for their soldiers .
The veil of uncertainty must , of course , be lifted .
You should be aware that the development of new arms will take many years .
During this period can we sacrifice our defence on the altar of unfounded fears ?
I do not think so .
War is always dirty because its objective is to attack human life .
That is why it is very gratifying that Parliament is dealing with this issue today .
I thank the High Representative for promising us complete information and transparency .
This also has to be said in such a debate .
The joint motion for a resolution also calls for a moratorium ...
( The President cut the speaker off ) ( Applause )
Mr President , just three points , because a great deal has already been said .
That is what it says in the verbatim report .
Until now that openness has been missing .
We have as our next point for discussion the issue of a rapid reaction force .
There is no link between depleted uranium and the illnesses .
It would be rather difficult to provide you with information we do not have .
A great many things have been said , all very interesting .
So , please do not think that no one paid any attention to the letter I received .
I have two observations which are almost personal observations .
Firstly , I make a very clear distinction between ends and means .
I would not like to be accused of confusing the ends with the means .
Different means , and our assessment of them , change over time .
I would therefore like to make it clear that that I am not confusing ends with means .
I have never done so and I would hope never to do so .
I would like to say something to those who accuse me of having asked this Parliament for its complicity .
In no way am I asking Parliament for its complicity , not now , not ever .
You represent the will of the people of the European Union and you are responsible for your own actions .
That does not mean I am using Parliament or making it complicit .
What I need to do is to ask you to accept your own responsibility .
I am accepting mine and you must accept yours .
And we cannot deny that the resolutions adopted by this Parliament gave me food for thought .
That is not making anybody complicit .
We must be able to share and to accept our collective responsibility .
I have nothing else to say .
Mr President , on a point of order .
I have just been looking at the text of the joint motion for a resolution .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon tomorrow .
Mr President , on a point of order .
Perhaps we could just settle that point of order now .
Lord Bethell is , and remains , firmly a member of the British Conservative Group .
Rapid reaction facility
In the past the Union has been rightly criticised for being slow in responding to crises .
I hope very much that Parliament will support it , and I will come back to that .
The original Commission proposal was dated April last year , but after that nothing happened .
It was blocked , it appears , by the French Presidency , with no explanation of what was happening .
It should , of course , be codecision , but it is not .
So we have an effective veto .
Hence the many amendments proposed by the committee .
They will no doubt explain why that was so .
This trend is continued by the current proposal for the rapid reaction facility .
So far , so good .
But the funds for this purpose must be allocated under Heading 4 of the Financial Perspective .
Every year , this allocation has been the subject of our bitterest budgetary wrangling with the Council .
We have no need of a crystal ball to predict a similar situation this year .
Should that be impossible , provision must be made for a revision of the Financial Perspective .
In addition , we want an obligation to consult Parliament on each action to be financed under the facility .
The rapporteur and the lead committee have complied with these budgetary wishes .
For this we are very grateful to them .
My group prefers the Commission text to the rapporteur ' s amendments on a number of scores .
The report mentions the clear involvement of the European Parliament in the policy .
Who knows whether more far-reaching coordination and guidance will be possible in the time to come .
We learn from our knock-backs , albeit with some delay .
The rapid reaction facility is , as far as this is concerned , an enormous step forward .
Our group will , incidentally , support that amendment .
This is why simple procedures are being proposed for the rapid reaction facility .
Comitology can be avoided by remaining within the Community framework .
Where is the European Union not active ?
This will widen the scope .
The rapid reaction facility must be flexible by nature .
This is a new instrument , and we can learn from its growing pains .
It is about fast decision-making , acting and funding .
It is of utmost importance for our Parliament to be totally involved .
Will we be informed about proposed action in good time ?
Can the Commissioner give us any reassurance in this respect ?
The only problem is that it does not even possess buckets with which to draw water .
Far greater importance surely attaches to action before the event , to preventive measures .
We consider the Commission ' s initiative to be an important one .
Mr President , the discussion on the rapid reaction facility is starting to drag .
Member States are still not agreed on the nuts and bolts of this mechanism .
However , I do not share the conclusions of the report on a different score .
Furthermore , we will lend the Union ' s and Member States ' initiatives the necessary coherence .
Article 308 is the only article on which this proposal can be based .
It appears to me that codecision for Parliament will delay matters unnecessarily .
But money is no substitute for political will and political influence .
And this is precisely where the EU has been failing .
We have an image problem in the eyes of the parties to the numerous conflicts in the world today .
That cannot be surmounted with new administrative units and financial plans alone .
This is a separate issue .
The Commission 's financial facility should not be mixed up with these defence issues .
Secondly , there is a thread of political correctness running through the proposal .
This is the main reason why we cannot accept this report .
These are clearly issues which come under the first pillar .
But how , and in what cases ?
What kind of procedures will this relationship employ ?
What kind of coordination ?
I therefore think it would have been beneficial for the document to have addressed this aspect as well .
The mechanisms for ensuring this already exist in the form of the United Nations and its various agencies .
The next item is the following oral questions :
Allow me just briefly to mention the three most important of these strategies .
Demands have been made for improvements on these issues .
We shall continue to highlight the importance of these issues .
Feasibility studies will be conducted in those areas regarded as having priority .
We similarly have responsibilities in other continents .
I understand that my services are keeping Parliament fully informed of this issue .
Parliament has shown an active interest in this subject for some time .
The implementation of humanitarian projects approved in the year 2000 will extend well into the summer of this year .
Secondly , Korea is the last nation in the world that is still divided by a wall .
I would like very much to see the European Community also establish diplomatic relations with the DPRK .
It is crazy to be doing that without having the ability to have a political dialogue .
Today their only exports are raw materials and military hardware .
Dialogue is the way forward .
Allow me just to make a few brief concluding remarks .
I personally believe that a diplomatic presence is of great importance .
I believe we must take his appeal seriously .
We should be prepared also to respond to this type of appeal when the time is right .
Thank you , Minister .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
I propose adjourning the sitting .
We shall resume at noon for the voting .
( The sitting was adjourned at 11.45 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon )
Mr President , our group , as you know , did not vote for the Sjöstedt report in committee .
The second , however , would be an oral amendment .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Before the vote
Mr President , I want to propose a technical oral amendment to Amendment No 28 .
I apologise for not spotting the technicality in committee .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
After paragraph 2
Before Amendment No 6
After the vote on Amendment No 6
Mr President , I would now like us to vote on the paragraph all the same .
After the vote on paragraph 6
Mr President , you mentioned that I had signed that motion on behalf of the Liberal Group .
I was born a Conservative and I trust that I will die a Conservative .
( Applause )
We would never have thought otherwise .
It was a mistake on the part of the services .

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Sjöstedt report ( A5-0387 / 2000 )
We regard these amendments as an attempt to undermine the existing habitat directive .
It shall inform the Commission of the compensatory measures adopted . "
Even so , I voted against the Sjöstedt report for two crucial reasons .
Cunha report ( A5-0367 / 2000 )
Moreover , such aid is often also misappropriated by the local administration .
Van den Bos report ( A5-0360 / 2000 )
This new agreement is a further sign of our continuing wish to strengthen our relations with Bangladesh .
Bangladesh is one of the poorest developing countries .
It has lived with and is constantly faced with the dangers of flooding and cyclones .
Bangladesh is very dependent on foreign aid .
The EU is a major provider of aid-17 % of all funds .
The EU is its biggest trading partner .
In 1998 we imported 45 % of its exports .
Bangladesh has a trade surplus with the EU .
This is of fundamental importance to the future of Bangladesh .
I welcome these efforts and look forward to further progress in this regard .
I hope that members of the European Parliament will form part of the team .
Newton Dunn report ( A5-0392 / 2000 )
That is an important observation that cannot be repeated often enough .
I think it is good for that to be repeated .
I hope that this is a misunderstanding between myself and the Swedish Government .
In spite of our having discussed this many times , misunderstandings may of course arise .
I therefore wish to take the opportunity to challenge the Swedish Government once again .
Mr President , what is the Rapid Reaction Mechanism ?
It does , however , stipulate that the interventions must have a " short life span " .
The imperialist nature of this is plain to see .
It will do so in conjunction with the United States within NATO .
Scientific and technological research will be siphoned off into the military sector .
The rapporteur goes so far as to propose explicitly the establishment of a European Police Force .
Oomen-Ruijten report ( A5-0338 / 2000 )
" If only they had ! " I replied .
- ( DA ) The Left party attaches importance to removing obstacles to the free movement of labour .
A large proportion of these problems can be solved if the Council demonstrates a capacity for action .
While we support this request , we abstained from the vote on the report .
That is what we all want .
Of course there are differing systems of provision for the elderly .
My pension entitlement would be greater if I had been employed in the public sector .
That , however , is not a problem that specifically concerns frontier workers .
This is not true either .
Nor do I understand what periods of secondment have to do with frontier workers .
Here too , the report is trying to force an open door .
Motion for a resolution on environment directives ( B5-0038 / 2001 )
Parish report ( A5-0357 / 2000 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
There was a poster of her urging all the passers-by to drink milk .
She was extremely successful and the ideal actress to persuade the Italians to drink milk .
Once again we hear calls for new subsidies , for so-called installation aid .
I voted against the report .
The report presents the situation as if all were well with the farming world .
But nothing is well with it .
BSE has cast doubt on the entire agricultural system .
That is precisely what we have to tell the young farmers .
This is certainly not the thrust of the report , which is why it must be rejected .
Young farmers are an essential part of the farming future .
Farmers help to promote a healthy and prosperous countryside by maintaining the landscape .
They will focus in particular on young farmers .
The Common Agricultural Policy has been a European success story , and we want to keep it that way .
The future lies with our young farmers and with agricultural practices which are sustainable and protect the environment .
We must lend our full support to these objectives .
It toys with the existing framework .
the need to simplify and integrate legislation affecting young farmers .
In the EU we need sustainable , high-quality agricultural production .
This has to be emphasised in the present debate .
The economic situation is unfavourable and sometimes extremely serious , particularly for young people .
What can the European Union do ?
Even Agenda 2000 neglects these fundamentally important aspects .
IT training must be set up .
In our view , this is emphatically not a supranational issue .
Varela Suanzes-Carpegna report ( A5-0365 / 2000 )
Gallagher report ( A5-0333 / 2000 )
This House has rejected that proposal again today .
Finally , I must say that there is a need for conservation .
We have seen a huge depletion in the fishing stocks within the European Union waters .
That is why we supported the Gallagher report .
. ( EL ) My group voted in favour of the resolution .
However , I must highlight one particular issue .
The Commission should adopt this resolution by the European Parliament .
We can , of course , support all these points in principle .
Such consultation will be even more essential when the time comes to draw up multiannual guidelines .
Poignant report ( A5-0332 / 2000 )
That is all well and good , but has it also consulted the fish , Mr President ?
In 2003 , Blue Europe , with its common fisheries policy , will be changed .
The CFP is being reviewed , and even overhauled , against a complex , multi-sided context .
Firstly , resources are finite .
Stocks such as hake , cod , sardine and tuna , are endangered or at risk .
There is wastage .
They make up 20 million tonnes of the total global catch of 122 million tonnes .
( Speech cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure )
Joint motion for a resolution on depleted uranium
The use of these weapons has already , therefore , been condemned in international law .
This is nothing short of scandalous and must be overturned .
I suspect , or rather , I fear , that this is what happened :
" Mr President , which weapons shall we use against Milosevic ? "
" The ones we usually use ! " replied the President .
" Which weapons do we usually use ? " asked the general .
" Do you mean depleted uranium shells as well ? "
" Yes , why not ? " said the President .
Mr President , in times of war we have to make do , as they say .
We would , of course , be deluding ourselves if we expected war criminals to accuse themselves .
That job belongs to the people .
Approximately 20 Balkans veterans have died from leukaemia , and the figure is growing .
American soldiers in KFOR were warned against breathing in depleted uranium .
There have also been a number of investigations showing that breathing in depleted uranium is extremely dangerous to health .
However , only the future will decide the matter .
We believe the matter has now been quite carefully examined .
These weapons should be covered by the provisions of the Geneva Convention concerning chemical and nuclear weapons .
All production ought to be stopped , and all stockpiles destroyed .
We demand an end to the use of depleted uranium weapons now .
This concern is therefore well grounded and should not be treated lightly .
In its entirety , therefore , the resolution is fair and I fully support it .
Did the discovery of the dangerous nature of depleted uranium weapons really come as a surprise ?
There is no such thing as a ' clean ' war .
. I voted for the moritorium on weapons using depleted uranium .
It is for these reasons that I am unable to vote in favour of the motion for a resolution .
Resolution on Korea
We must do all we can to encourage this change .
Need we remind you that diplomacy is one of the regal powers of every sovereign state ?
Each state is free to conduct diplomatic relations with any other .
That concludes voting time .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.35 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
The conclusions are expected to be adopted at the Council ' s meeting at the end of January .
It is still unclear whether a resolution on China is to be adopted in this year ' s session .
The ambition , this year too , is to achieve as strong support as possible for this resolution .
Close cooperation with private organisations is a central factor , as is cooperation with regional organisations .
They will form the basis for carrying forward the dialogue in a constructive and meaningful manner .
Access by the special representative remains , of course , a key preoccupation .
We must congratulate ourselves in Europe on some progress but not enough has been achieved .
I believe though that I should mention two or three of the particular problems of Russia .
The war on dissent continues on the part of Mr Putin .
He seems not to have a sense of humour .
This is the basis not only for our internal work but also for our foreign policy .
It was good to hear of the ambitions of the Swedish Presidency here today .
The issue of refugees must also be raised .
Violations of human rights occur in many countries .
In certain countries , the situation is alarming , however .
The President-in-Office of the Council mentioned Iran and Chechnya .
I should also like to add Saudi Arabia , Colombia , Indonesia and Afghanistan .
In these countries , too , the situation is very alarming .
Both the UN and the EU are important voices in the international debate .
Many countries listen and take note of signals from ' Brussels ' .
It requires consistency , courage and a more thoroughly worked out strategy .
They are also universal principles , despite certain differences in emphasis .
To some extent that is inevitable .
It would be desirable if the Union had a common voice in this important area .
Non-governmental organisations and civil societies are sources of indispensable help .
That is partly what this speech is about .
There is nonetheless some quite sharp criticism , and I am very glad about that .
I am also pleased that Chechnya has been mentioned .
There are some areas to which I think too little priority has been given .
In this connection , we need to keep our eyes on our so-called friends .
I think we have to be aware of the situation in the United States .
Turkey does not comply with the Convention Against Torture .
Mrs Malmström and Mrs Frahm have just spoken on the subject of China .
Lord Bethell spoke about Chechnya .
However , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , you refer to the Union ' s consensus position .
Throughout the world , one woman in three suffers physical abuse .
Firstly , there is the phenomenon of paedophilia and child pornography .
I would like to draw your attention to the excellent report by Mr Kirkhope on the subject .
Two new revelations show how serious the situation is .
A second disturbing phenomenon is that of trafficking in human beings .
Trafficking in human beings has become a very lucrative international industry , often risking the lives of the passengers .
The victims are undoubtedly always political opponents of the regimes in power .
This list is long but it is not comprehensive .
Parliament will do itself credit by demanding that the governments of Europe adopt a firm position on this issue .
We have just approved the new Charter of Fundamental Rights .
We must act in accordance with our principles .
The victims ' families are awaiting our action .
It is crucial that we are consistent and specific .
The situation of the developing countries is quite different in this respect .
We must be clear which sanctions are to be imposed .
That is why I have touched upon a number of other areas today .
I have a rough idea of what is happening in the country .
However , beware of being led up the garden path .
What we are talking about here is a double human rights violation .
What this in fact means is that these children suffer a triple injustice .
That was the message I particularly wanted to get across .
Free speech , freedom of assembly and freedom of movement are suppressed .
Tens of thousands of them have been subjected to persecution , imprisonment and torture .
A sustained campaign is being conducted with a view to converting Buddhist believers into atheists .
We cannot close our eyes to this second cultural revolution .
I am not unaware , Commissioner Vitorino , of the dialogue between the European Union and China .
Attempts are being made to deal more sensitively with major trading partners .
But we cannot wait until that day finally dawns .
Human rights are not a Western invention .
I would also thank you for the many practical points of view which have been presented in the debate .
Allow me to comment on a few of them .
First of all , Russia and , more specifically , Chechnya . Lord Bethell is right .
It was Chechnya and not Russia that I mentioned .
We have not therefore in any way forgotten this important issue .
A number of speakers discussed the situation in China .
There are problems here , to which many of the Members referred in their speeches .
Right now , we are engaged in a dialogue with China .
Mrs Frahm discussed the issue of the death penalty , which is incredibly important .
That must not , of course , prevent us from paying attention to the problems that exist .
In conclusion , a few words about the situation in Burma / Myanmar .
A range of measures have been mooted there , which the European Union strongly supports .
A few concrete words on some of the remarks .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Vitorino .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday , at 12 noon .
Programme of the Swedish Presidency
It is my very great pleasure to welcome Mr Persson , the Swedish Prime Minister .
Without further ado , I shall give you the floor .
Thank you , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , for your speech .
I shall now give the floor to Mr Prodi , the President of the Commission .
We see evidence of this in the mad cow problem .
I would like to appeal to the Swedish Presidency .
You are admittedly no past masters at negotiating the institutional labyrinth of the Community .
You therefore have a special responsibility .
You said that the Treaty would be signed within a month .
We shall have to wait and see what changes are introduced into the Treaty .
This is not acceptable .
We must see an end to this method .
( Applause )
We have four years to get to work .
He proposed a three-phase operation , with the first phase consisting of open deliberations .
Secondly , what method should we adopt ?
These days it is available on the Internet .
That is a way of adapting and improving the Convention method , nothing more .
( Applause )
It can show our fellow countrymen at home that good things can be accomplished together in the EU .
We would also like to have a date for when the first countries will be able to join us .
As a case in point , why not begin by opening up the meetings of the Council of Ministers ?
The treaties must be simplified .
The EU ' s tasks and powers must be more clearly defined .
We Liberals also believe that Europeans need a common European constitution .
Citizens must be involved in the work which will follow on from the conclusions of the Nice summit .
He certainly did not wish to lose it in a violent manner .
It is now or never .
The objectives and indicators must be confirmed in Gothenburg in accordance with what you have told us .
Conflict prevention in all areas of foreign policy is very important to our Group .
We welcome your promise of a programme in this area .
The environment must no longer be damaged and animals must no longer be mistreated .
May I welcome you to the club .
Environmental taxes are an obvious example .
This will not lead to the openness you are striving for .
I should like to call this a ' Swedish paradox ' .
I hope you take up the challenge set out by the President of the Commission .
There are also other positive features of the programme which deserve to be highlighted .
In relation to this objective , the outcome of the Nice Summit is a failure .
No reforms to the EU were actually made there which would facilitate enlargement .
Instead , the decision process became more complicated .
This is an embarrassing mistake which must be rectified .
Such discrimination is not acceptable .
This policy must be reconsidered .
Several members of the Swedish Government have talked in positive terms about this idea .
Now - during this presidency - is your golden opportunity to take initiatives .
Sweden actively opposed public registers of GM crops .
From an environmental point of view , EU legislation in this area is still inadequate
The EU army will even include Turkish troops .
With these words , the United Left would like to wish the Swedish Presidency every success .
I also welcome the comments made by the Commission President , Mr Prodi .
This is the core of the problem when it comes to the issue of enlargement of the European Union .
If you will allow me , I would like to ask you a brief question on an urgent matter .
In a few days ' time , the Union is due to make a statement on Afghanistan .
We think it is a good custom for the presidency to alternate .
At present , the outcome is more centralism and less parliamentary democracy .
On the other hand , I do not believe the much-praised Convention is fully developed yet as a procedure .
It could , however , serve as the blueprint for a workable procedure .
On Sunday , 14 January Austria had its first suspected case of BSE .
I hope the same will apply to all future suspected cases in Austria .
The common security and defence policy has to be made more concrete during the Swedish Presidency .
Relations between the EU and NATO will be of the greatest importance .
In ten years ' time , the EU will have the most dynamic economy in the world .
The Stockholm Summit will provide an excellent opportunity .
May it become a deregulation summit for jobs and prosperity .
The time has come to get rid of the EU ' s final protectionist barriers .
The Tobin tax is a threat to the poor of the world .
A Tobin tax would only serve to undermine the efficiency of the market .
The most important one is , of course , enlargement .
Sweden ' s ambitions of speeding up the process in this area are entirely legitimate .
I realise that this is going to be difficult .
The second priority concerns jobs .
Sweden has been pressing on with the issue of employment .
The method applied is the open coordination method .
I would like to receive some indication to this effect .
The third priority concerns long-term sustainable development .
The EU is , after all , fairly successful where environmental policy is concerned .
It was important , especially for the enlargement process , that there was agreement in Nice .
The way in which decisions were made behind closed doors was not good , either .
I trust that Sweden will also actively pursue the goal of a more open decision-making process .
I sincerely hope that Sweden can make a contribution to this issue .
I would also like to say a few words about crisis management .
Active crisis management is about trying to prevent conflicts .
Once again , I wish to welcome Sweden as the country holding the presidency .
Many issues revolve around the three Es .
Allow me to highlight a fourth one , namely E for Empathy .
Many people died in their fight for a better life .
Europe must not be transformed into some kind of fortress .
But what has happened since ?
Well , the development in Europe has taken a wrong turn .
It has been proposed that the penalties for trafficking in human beings be made more severe .
This is necessary , but the proposals are unfocused in their effect .
These proposals must be stopped .
In Sweden , protection against the violation of the sanctity of churches has prevailed since the Middle Ages .
Europe is being closed .
To impose a visa requirement on 130 countries is not worthy of a democratic Europe .
The basic rule must be that people have the right to travel freely to the EU .
Empathy is the key word .
Finally , enlargement .
How does the presidency propose to implement this ambitious programme ?
There are five questions I would like to ask you .
Firstly , what do you propose to do with the heavily criticised Commission proposal in this sphere ?
What would your answer be to that ?
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I wish Sweden good luck in its first presidency .
The three Es are three good priorities that we share .
I would like to talk briefly about enlargement .
We support this as much as you do .
It must be successful .
The legacy of Nice is not a good legacy .
You will have to deal with it .
It was the same for the euro .
This means , however , that we should reinforce convergence and incentive instruments .
Mergers and restructuring are frequent occurrences .
What is their added value in terms of employment and growth ?
The Commission applies the current criteria .
The Council would probably be well advised to adjust the balance of these criteria .
Competition should also work in favour of employment .
I did have more questions but I am out of time .
Mr President , Parliament is a place where we do not actually debate very much .
You will get used to it and you will find it does not sadden you too much .
It certainly saddens me .
Parliament will be adopting positions on some eighty food safety directives .
We are now beginning to discuss the proposal for a European food authority .
I would be interested to hear what the Prime Minister ' s attitude is to such an authority .
Such an overall solution requires more than the proposed food authority .
I hope to have the support of the presidency for this idea .
Why was a negative decision made on this in Nice ?
Finally , I would like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency .
I do not know exactly what you meant by that .
Instead , I will concentrate on the major European issues .
I hope that this will be the case .
I would like it to happen , but I am not sure if it will .
There is no firmer support for enlargement than that offered by the European Parliament .
This is more a project of the European Parliament than of any other institution .
It is Parliament that has been responsible for enlargement .
In their speeches , several Members have also talked about the environmental issue .
I attach great value to the statements of Mrs Hautala and others .
All the major environmental problems we see at present will be resolved by new technology .
This is something of which I am convinced .
We know what , in all likelihood , needs to be done .
Look at environmental concern as a visionary contribution to a better and more modern Europe .
Add all this together , and we should be able to obtain a promising outcome in Gothenburg .
Our situation is such that we are not vulnerable to outside influences .
An isolated country is vulnerable , but not so a union of countries .
That core has , of course , already been built .
There are different expressions .
Irrespective of which methods we apply , openness is of fundamental importance .
Together , not individually .
You are all very welcome .
We will first submit our proposals in the framework of a legislative procedure .
I wonder if four questions could be transmitted to the Swedish Presidency .
Secondly , could the bureaucratic negotiations be tempered by an understanding of the past ?
Clearly today it has been Sweden 's day .
We have recently had perhaps the most confused Summit the EU has ever seen .
In my opinion , all three E ' s are a guarantee of this sustainability .
The interesting contribution by Commissioner Prodi confirmed the challenges we face .
I listened with interest to the Prime Minister ' s comments on the environmental issues .
For ten years , this question has been blocked by individual governments .
The question is whether the Swedish Government will be prepared to think again .
Is the Swedish Government prepared to act in this spirit ?
What happened ?
Here , I am convinced , lies the crucial weakness of what was decided in Nice .
Mr President of the Council , Sweden has a great tradition of democracy and transparency .
I want to address a second point .
I am persuaded that the European Commission ought to undertake to do more here than it has to date .
The French Presidency gave us clear information .
That in turn leads to a paradoxical situation .
How are the markets to understand it ?
We must do our outmost to return to a sensible situation here .
The debate is closed .
Question Time ( Council )
Question No 1 by ( H-0952 / 00 ) :
Did the Council also bring up the problem of the widespread trafficking in Chinese women and girls ?
Preparations for the meeting are currently under way at expert level .
The most popular areas are the poor provinces .
Trafficking in women is also rife within China .
It is a very good thing that you formed this council after the Dover scandal .
IOM is probably the organisation with the most expertise in the area .
I assume that such contacts will be established very quickly .
Question No 3 by ( H-0956 / 00 ) :
The first concerns assistance for citizens of the European Union from the diplomatic and consular representations .
The second relates to implementation measures for the aforementioned decisions .
The United Kingdom is providing consular services in Mecca during the Haj pilgrimage .
There are several consulates in Jeddah which can assist EU citizens during the pilgrimage .
This is at least stated in the decisions that have been taken .
This approach is a new way of harmonising technical requirements for products in the directives .
. ( DE ) Mr President , the EC label is an important factor of consumer protection .
But it is a purely quantitative measure .
All that is necessary is to prove compliance with existing European legal provisions .
That is certainly not enough for the consumer .
Question No 5 by ( H-0965 / 00 ) :
Torture is one of the most pressing problems in Turkey .
Naturally , the EU does not tolerate torture and abuse of prisoners .
The Council will , of course , continue to monitor the situation closely .
A large proportion of the prisoners in Turkish prisons must be regarded as political prisoners .
In Turkey , people are also still being convicted on political grounds .
This was his only ' crime ' , and for this he was to be convicted .
Question No 6 by ( H-0967 / 00 ) :
However , public Council debates can be held .
This decision has now been incorporated into the Council 's Rules of Procedure .
Other Council constellations are also holding public debates .
No , I shall not allow the best to become the enemy of the good .
Nine debates are actually not particularly impressive , if I may say so .
It is quite simply a fundamental demand for democracy .
We think that we are probably doing this with the increased number of debates that are open .
We can draw parallels with most national parliaments .
Take , for example , the Swedish Parliament .
Even a long march begins with a small step .
Question No 7 by ( H-0970 / 00 ) :
It is a great pleasure and honour to be able to welcome here Lars Danielsson and the Swedish Presidency .
My warm thanks for your reply .
At this point I would like to take up some attendant issues .
You mentioned the presidential election in Belarus in 2001 .
Question No 8 by ( H-0974 / 00 ) :
I would appreciate an answer , one I hope will be yes .
Naturally , I am in favour of such a scheme .
Each individual will of course be treated precisely as an individual .
Question No 9 by ( H-0976 / 00 ) :
This concerns in particular the resolution on the oil for food programme .
As the author is not present , Question No 10 lapses .
I must apply the Rules of Procedure .
My hands are tied in this matter .
I am very sorry .
Since they deal with the same subject , Questions Nos 11 and 12 will be taken together .
Question No 11 by Glenys Kinnock ( H-0983 / 00 ) :
Subject : Burma
Question No 12 by Richard Corbett ( H-1004 / 00 ) :
Subject : ASEAN and Burma
It seems now as if the mission will be undertaken later this month .
Mr President , may I also welcome the Presidency-in-Office .
That is my first question .
This does not in any way mean that we should dance to the tune of the Burmese Government .
We are making strong demands for complete accessibility , with regard to both the NLD and ethnic minorities .
The latter must not , of course , be forgotten in this connection .
Thank you for that very comprehensive answer .
They will , therefore , not be able to take part in that meeting .
ASEAN countries are pressuring the Union to lift that ban .
Can I have your assurance that you will not give in to such pressure ?
The Council does not give in to pressure .
Question No 13 by ( H-0985 / 00 ) :
The Commission will table its proposals in the near future .
I hope , therefore , that Parliament is willing to cooperate with the Council on this point .
Thank you for your response and also for giving us a few more moments .
I fully agree with the honourable Member ' s view .
Are there any proposals for compensation to fishermen ?
That concludes Questions to the Council .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.43 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
This in itself has proved to be a difficult exercise .
But the Community has committed itself to adopting harmonised safety requirements for the operation of aircraft .
However , there are areas in which Parliament needs to act .
Firstly , in regard to cabin crew .
In addition , the cabin crew directive should now be incorporated into this regulation .
The relevant part , known as Subpart Q , is missing .
In this area , the social partners have been trying to reach an agreement for ten years .
I am hopeful that the relevant social partners will reach an agreement .
I am grateful to them for their current efforts .
Amendments have been proposed that also look at the problem of cabin baggage .
I find it totally amazing that groups in Parliament will vote against this amendment .
I believe that the report before us is worth supporting .
We are prepared to introduce this into the regulation too , at second reading .
We are also going to be discussing dangerous matters here .
We will revisit this issue at a later stage .
The other category is workload .
Another factor to be taken into consideration is competition .
But they have not reached agreement .
The Commission behaved very politely and did not make any proposals of its own .
These issues must be settled .
Let me address a second point that caught my attention at the December Council meeting .
It can wait till May , till the two parties have reached agreement .
The Commission and Parliament should jointly see to that .
Hence , the Community adopted Council Regulation 3922 / 91 .
This regulation listed a number of technical requirements - JARs - produced by the Joint Aviation Authority .
It is not for Parliament to legislate on flight time limitations .
But first and foremost , flying must be safe .
There are , however , different views on how to achieve greater safety .
Perhaps less would be more in this case .
The Simpson report is a good step along this road .
Let us take that step tomorrow and then pursue it further in a politically convincing manner .
This means common control methods and technical and administrative organisation and support .
In this respect I believe that he has been very successful .
With regard to technical requirements , the report mainly deals with two aspects .
There are other possibilities , such as amending the Regulation after the adoption of the present proposal .
Various amendments have also been adopted on the requirements applicable to cabin crews .
We must take care to ensure that the two texts are in agreement and compatible with one another .
The Commission is already under institutional obligation to carry out the consultations laid down in the amendments .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Priorities in road safety
, rapporteur .
Each year , over 42,000 people are killed on our European roads .
This means more than 800 people a week and over 115 people this very day .
Millions of people are also seriously injured each year , and many will end up handicapped for life .
This is a matter of great human suffering and of heavy social costs .
The objective in the long-term should be that no-one should be killed or seriously injured .
The Commission ' s communication contains a list of priorities for measures for the remaining period of the Programme .
The Committee proposes those targets which were already established by Parliament three years ago .
We also need European legislation in certain important areas .
Alcohol kills approximately 9 000 people on the roads each year .
Furthermore , the trend indicates that more and more young people are driving with alcohol in their blood .
According to the Commission , drink-driving is a question that falls under the principle of subsidiarity .
But how can that be ?
We have powers in the EU when it comes to issues concerning road traffic safety .
I expect the Council and the Swedish Presidency to take the initiative in this matter .
The Commission should have waited for Parliament to have held its discussion .
Thousands more of our fellow creatures die in traffic accidents than from BSE .
This should be a cause for panic .
I would like to thank the Commission for its outstanding analysis of the situation .
Four times as many people die in road accidents in Portugal than in Britain .
However , there is plenty more scope for improvement in every country .
I will mention three important ways of reducing the number of road fatalities .
Firstly , there is compliance with speed restrictions .
And it is no wonder , because only very rarely do I see any speed controls in operation .
The accident statistics for these areas speak plainly .
Secondly , in vino veritas : there is truth in wine .
People sometimes have to be protected from their own governments .
The third point has to do with taxation .
High taxes on cars lead to old and unsafe cars on the road .
My country is a sad example of this .
Finland is the Cuba of Europe when it comes to the age of cars .
Cars that fulfil stringent safety standards should also benefit from lower taxation .
Ladies and gentlemen , I wish you a safe trip .
Remember to fasten your safety belt in the back too .
In fact there are only two points that I wish to make this evening .
A year on there is no directive .
What we have in February is a hearing .
More talk . No action .
No more talk , please . Let us see some action .
And , indeed , the same is true for blood alcohol .
We have had talk on this issue , year in , year out .
We all know that ten thousand people a year in Europe are killed in drink-related crashes .
We must tackle that particular problem .
She has issued a recommendation on drink driving .
We know a recommendation , alas , is simply not worth the paper it is written on .
Member States need and support clear guidance .
It is quite clear that we need action .
Indeed the British government is asking for a solution at European level , in a European context .
I would like to address three particular points .
Managing also means making choices , and the time is ripe for this .
A second point I would like to raise relates to alcohol limits in the blood .
The signal we send out must be clear .
Either a standard is safe or it is not .
And 0.5 % is a socially responsible , easily measurable and enforceable quantity to my mind .
This will encourage a non-committal attitude and will certainly do nothing to increase transparency from the citizens ' perspective .
My final point relates to the long-term ' Vision Zero ' objective .
I have a problem with this .
An objective must be realistic and achievable , that is what motivates and stimulates .
There are many reasons for the accidents and the extremely high number of victims on European roads .
For cultural and climatic reasons , there are an extraordinary number of these accidents in certain Member States .
We must now be bold .
Let us be vigilant of the environmental impact of traffic , such as noise and environmental pollution .
I would also like to reiterate the importance of legislating on the maximum permitted levels of alcohol .
Finally , I would like to thank the Commissioner for being so very open to our proposals .
I just want to address the previous speaker for a moment .
My colleagues are holding a sham debate , a totally sham debate .
The point we make is this : we want checks .
That is the crucial question , not what the law says .
It is crucial to have on-the-spot checks .
That is why we will reject the first part of Amendment No 4 .
Talk to your countries .
That is what we recommended to all these countries .
The people you should talk to , Mr Watts , are those who do not apply that .
That will give us the greatest road safety .
In my country we have speed limits on 95 % of all roads .
Where do the accidents happen ?
On the 95 % of roads , because there are not enough speed checks there either .
That is what road safety needs .
The European Union loses 4 people an hour .
Road traffic accidents are the most common cause of death among children and young people .
Entire families are being sacrificed on the asphalt alter .
This will attract citizens ' attention and provide an effective focal point .
We , ladies and gentlemen , have a huge responsibility both here and in Brussels .
What does this mean ?
The same applies to drinking .
Mr President , let me thank the rapporteur for the great commitment she has shown in this matter .
Last year , nearly 43,000 people were killed on the road networks of the EU .
One of the main reasons for this was the use of alcohol .
There is no getting away from this fact .
Allow me to point out two things for those who are in two minds about this issue .
Something has to be done about this .
We must seek to make our roads safer .
There is very great suffering among those who lose a family member as a result of a car accident .
Our society is becoming increasingly mobile , and I am in favour of it .
But that is precisely why it is our duty to tackle the risks .
The analysis of road accidents is decisive .
We must identify and seek where possible to remedy them .
I see this as a most important aspect .
And here I think road user education is essential .
The EU road safety programme aims to define the main priorities clearly .
Above all , we need to take a systematic approach to these problems .
It is vital to call for cooperation between the Commission and the Member States .
Subsidiarity is , therefore , particularly applicable here .
But beware , let us make no mistake .
We need to utilise all opportunities , and that is what we shall do .
We have not said no to a directive before .
Now , we have the chance of taking a political initiative , so let us do so .
Finally , there is the matter of education and the situation of children .
Just as Mrs Schierhuber said , we need to have road safety education .
We must make vigorous joint efforts to this end .
The first is drink-driving .
Ladies and gentlemen , you are absolutely right .
The date is purely coincidental .
It was in the communication in March .
You must not believe that there has been any manoeuvring by anyone .
I thought that this was at a more advanced stage .
I am sorry .
But I would like to explain why no proposal for a directive is being presented .
This is not being done for two fundamental reasons .
I do not know .
What we need is better control on the part of the authorities .
Then let them implement 0.5 in the United Kingdom .
Why do we have to force them to do so ?
I cannot accept that criticism .
And we have given the automobile industries six months to reach an agreement .
They do not have until 2002 , Mr Watts , but until June 2001 .
I am not going to maintain rigid positions on this issue .
I do not believe that that is the main problem .
The problem of control is much more important .
Mr President , my name was mentioned .
Mr President , on a point of order .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Intermodality and intermodal freight transport
Mr President , intermodality is still in its infancy .
Not even 8 % of our freight is transported by several different modes of transport .
It is surprising that there is no breakthrough in intermodal transport in the offing .
But that being the case , a few warnings are in order for the relevant sectors .
Secondly , environmental considerations will play an increasingly important part over the next ten years .
Driving a lorry through certain parts of Europe will meet with increasing opposition .
The people will put up increasingly stubborn resistance to transport violations of their environment .
The trans-European water networks must be brought to fruition quickly and as a matter of priority .
The extension of the PACT programme , pilot actions in combined transport , will also spur matters on .
But unfortunately , intermodal transport is still too expensive anyway .
That is why this kind of transport is often not taken seriously enough yet .
The signals are not all set wrong there yet .
I also hope that we will give intermodal transport due importance in the Sixth Framework Research Programme .
For we do not yet have any real operators in this area .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work .
Our group is in favour of adopting the report with its amendments .
We have already said a great deal on this subject , and so I shall keep this very brief .
We want to give this trend a huge boost .
I would also like to thank all the Members who have spoken in the debate today .
As the report indicates , we will have to invest in the necessary infrastructure and its management .
Intermodal transport is one of the key elements in it .
The charging policies that we are going to present will support the competitiveness of intermodal transport .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Charging for the use of transport infrastructure
Well then , these practices can now , in my opinion , be generalised and made available to everyone .
We are about to review the trans-European networks ; these are both important subjects .
Allow me to make just a few comments on the Costa report .
That is the first issue .
Firstly , we must finally achieve a single market in this area .
We do not want any forcing up of prices .
Last point : in relation to external costs I have two requests .
How can they be calculated and how can they be charged ?
We never received that report .
Secondly , we must differentiate when we calculate these external costs .
To give just one example : congestion costs .
Congestion , pollution , gridlock , global warming , floods , freak weather .
Is it the end of the world ?
No , it is just rush-hour in my region .
The same problems are occurring in regions and Member States across the European Union .
Something surely , colleagues , must be done .
However , as we all know , everyone wants someone else to do it .
That is our challenge .
Secondly , we must promote an exchange of ideas .
There were concerns , for example , about subsidiarity .
Indeed , the work we have done has already gained and secured widespread support .
I would also like to say thank you for the interesting debate on the subject with some illuminating examples .
There are still a lot of problems attached to a system of charges .
Covering overall costs with fares will work in areas where there is a lot of transport .
Allow me to explain as follows - it will also speak of a certain amount of exasperation .
When I see how long it all takes , that is when I start losing patience .
We can do it for accidents all right , but not for other things .
I have a problem with this .
Again , there is more than enough data for us to make headway with this whole affair .
Apart from that , I wish everyone luck at the drafting stage .
We must extend the quality choice range in the variety of transport available .
Secondly , I also believe that we need to pinpoint priority issues .
We cannot consider rail users and road users on the same level either .
All studies have clearly shown this .
We must give this factor priority in terms of Community action .
Yet this cross-border problem demands a cross-border solution .
That is something we are all agreed on in this House .
That is why I am surprised that opinion is so divided on this .
However , that must not be our sole point of departure .
You will appreciate that I am unable to vote in favour of the present resolution as it stands .
Furthermore , he has had many amendments to work through .
The political stumbling block is that our fellow citizens want to travel .
This was obvious last September .
At present , revenue is not earmarked for transport infrastructure .
Quite often , I know in the UK , it is used for bolstering government coffers .
I am sure it is the same in other EU Member States .
Hauliers in the UK complain that they are at a competitive disadvantage , and that is true .
Non-UK truck drivers do not pay UK road tax .
Other EU countries ' average is ten times lower HTV taxes .
The same applies to diesel fuel : it is three times more expensive in the UK .
That leads to distortion of competition across the EU .
Nobody knows exactly how much is invested .
On the other hand , the state receives revenue from transport , such as road tax .
This report talks about balancing the payment of social costs between the different modes of transport .
Let us take a moment to consider the train in this light .
Road transport always seemed to cause far more pollution than rail transport .
Following research , this seems not to be the case .
We want people to travel by train and so it must be made more affordable .
That is fine by me , but not by using this method .
Road and passenger traffic already pay far more than their share in terms of social costs .
Commissioner , I must say , this is a hornet ' s nest you have got yourself into .
Why should a system of this kind only be applied to the transport sector ?
We cannot ignore that fact .
Therefore , in fact , we are talking about favouring rail transport .
I believe that this is one of the bases which justify the imposition of tariffs .
The time has therefore come to tame the automobile .
Nobody wants to be deprived of an automobile , but we must tame it .
On the one hand , by means of research , aimed at reducing consumption .
On the other hand , however , we must also influence drivers .
However , in practice , it would appear that such measures would be attended by unexpected and unintended effects .
I do not see eye to eye with Mr Bouwman on that score .
The desired modal shift will come under review again then .
My second concern is that the cost to transport will rise by a substantial amount .
That would be to the detriment of Europe ' s economic position .
I am against cross-subsidies for the same reason .
The gradual harmonisation of transport infrastructure charges is the most important step towards that .
Many transport associations are themselves seeing it that way now .
The report also coincides with the Commission ' s policy on charging for transport infrastructures .
A great deal , however , remains to be done .
Thank you very much , Mrs de Palacio .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
( The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m. )
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Yesterday ' s Minutes have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Unfortunately , I noticed too late that my name was not on the attendance register .
However , I was here the entire day and took part in all the roll-call votes and other votes .
I would be grateful if this could therefore be corrected .
Mr Posselt , of course the Minutes will be corrected to reflect the true situation .
Mr President , Mrs Maes is not present in the Chamber .
She is attending a Bureau meeting of our group .
She spoke in the debate on the Swedish Presidency .
I would ask you to amend the attendance register accordingly .
That will certainly be done , Mr Staes .
( Parliament adopted the Minutes )
The terrorist belongs to the Armata Corsa organisation .
It says nothing about Strasbourg .
In any event , thank you for your information .
He has evidently been accused of spying .
This was a cause for great concern .
Balanced participation of women and men in the decision-making process
The 20th century began with women fighting for the right to vote .
We need an effective strategy leading to positive measures .
We need to combat ignorance and outmoded clichés about gender roles .
The lack of equal opportunities in the labour market needs to be tackled by developing talent early on .
The main concerns are covered in the four amendments which I have tabled jointly with Astrid Lulling .
They are doing it themselves and have been doing so for a long time .
However , the two most important amendments are about rejecting the establishment of quotas .
We know that there are various systems in the Member States .
Some have quota arrangements of one kind or another .
The principle of subsidiarity should come into play here .
Elsewhere , governments are called upon to review the differential impact of varying electoral systems .
That is not a job for governments - it is a job for the parties .
We regard these amendments as so important that we have requested a roll-call vote .
The European Union has made considerable progress in this regard .
I am pleased to bear glad tidings from my own country .
It would be a mistake to reject quotas , as the parties are being urged to do .
The right thing is to keep all mechanisms open .
I think it is exemplary in the way it is written .
I should therefore like to say a couple of things about Denmark .
We clearly have a problem , therefore .
I personally believe that this has to do with the demands made of women in the hierarchical system .
But that is , of course , something we can discuss .
Globalisation and ICT will pull in two different directions .
That attitude will be of no less immediate importance in connection with enlargement .
Mr President , I wish to congratulate Mrs Karamanou on a very good and comprehensive report .
One of its main themes is the need for an integrated strategy .
Wherever it looked it found women were under-represented .
The problems have been recognised for a long time , but progress on solving them has been slow .
We have to keep on saying these things because they are needed .
One of the prerequisites of this is control of women ' s sexuality and fertility .
I would like to come back briefly to the question of how we practise self-repression .
We are waiting for what is called the ' ketchup effect ' .
Women ' s representation requires more democracy , not less .
I have in mind framework conditions that allow women to take responsibility for shaping their own individual lifestyle .
It is not a matter of quotas and positive discrimination .
If you will forgive me , I consider that notion in itself to be absurd .
How can discrimination be positive ?
But the voices of women are absent when it comes to taking key decisions and setting priorities .
This is unacceptable in a democracy .
In order to achieve a balance , a concrete plan of action with a set timetable is needed .
An important part of such a plan is a benchmarking system .
I am therefore very pleased that Mrs Karamanou would like to see such a system .
Women are under-represented on the legal and legislative bodies that judge these crimes .
Failure to utilise women ' s decision-making abilities is an unacceptable waste .
Women represent 50 per cent of our Government and 44 per cent of the Swedish Parliament .
Mr President , I want to express my thanks for a good report .
So what can be done ?
This is unacceptable and needs to be the focus of more attention .
All the figures consistently demonstrate this and we are making slow progress .
That is less than 10 % , and that means that the French situation is significant .
Let us not talk of positive discrimination quotas or anything else .
This is the only comment I wanted to make .
It was our final argument in the battle for equality .
Certainly , I am gaining a great deal from the current experience in France .
We have to work on this .
It is a much more complex issue .
We might well question how this should be done .
How can we help women ?
The quota system , therefore , is not a system specifically designed for women .
It is likely that it will also be applied to other areas in future .
I have quoted one example .
I cannot understand , therefore , those who are so anxious about this system .
I am in favour of a quota system .
I am an advocate of the system .
I support the Karamanou report .
So the aim must be the adoption of national electoral regulations which provide for the creation of parity lists .
We must change this situation .
So , Mr President , it is the German text which takes precedence .
I ask Members to be aware of this and to bear it in mind when we vote .
However , although there has been some modest progress , there are still some conspicuous shortcomings .
One important area we need to tackle is education and training .
Amongst other things , women have to learn to lay claim to a role in leadership and decision making .
Quotas are therefore an important instrument if we are to approach this target .
The fate of working women is linked to the status of the working class as a whole .
However , we can legitimately ask if this always applies .
As a rule , this under-representation is not because of any lack of skill or expertise .
I am doing so in order to be fair and because I believe they are deserved .
This Chamber does not produce paper by the metre .
We are engaged in politics and politics must have a sound basis .
In my speech I shall focus on the electoral system .
This is a crucial problem because it predates our own participation in politics .
Some electoral systems make the participation of women even more difficult .
These are , as we have seen , systems that use single name lists .
This practice has systematically penalised women .
Allow me to start by making a political observation .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at noon .
Competitiveness of EU forest-based and related industries
The report recommends that the peat industry should be included in this cluster .
The same problem also relates to Mrs Ainardi ' s proposed amendment .
Wood is a renewable natural resource .
It has many uses ; for example , it can be used in the energy industry .
Member States are the best experts when it comes to managing their own forests .
Instead , it has an important job to do , safeguarding the competitiveness of forest-based industries .
The needs of the forestry industry must also be taken into account in commercial policy .
Such ideas must be promoted within a new Framework Programme of research .
And finally : if the forests do well , so will people .
The Hague Convention on World Climate Change failed .
The coordination of matters of forestry in the EU is poor .
There are more Directorates-General to deal with them but there is a lack of uniformity .
Our committee approved them by general consensus .
So you see the strong Finnish theme in this report continues even with me .
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
Better to say too much about forestry than too little .
I think that might be stretching the Commissioner 's powers a little bit .
I see he is smiling so perhaps he agrees with me .
Nevertheless , the Commission has to ensure that fair competition takes place .
That is the key issue here , rather than trying to favour our industry .
For this reason , paragraph 17 in this report is very important .
Forests create peace .
Now the basis of the activity is changing and the focus is on new approaches .
The report is comprehensive in its present form .
Our group supports the views set forth in the report and most of the amendments to it .
We ourselves are tabling a few amendments , which we ask you to support .
In this sense , the importance of construction with wood should be highlighted more obviously .
This importance is particular evident in the area of employment .
Climate change : the rapporteur makes some interesting comments here .
I agree with him that we should urgently implement the Kyoto Agreement .
That is what we all want to do .
However , I fail to understand the reference to the oceans .
This would be cofunded under the common agricultural rural development programme .
Not sufficient research is being done on the growing of tropical hardwoods .
Together , the forestry and wood industries provide millions of jobs in Europe .
Globally speaking , we must protect our forests in order to defend ourselves against disasters .
I am therefore very grateful to the previous speaker for her comments .
I would particularly like to draw attention to protected forests and virgin forests in the Alps .
Appropriate proposals for the construction industry need to be pursued .
A further advantage of wood is that it involves fixing large quantities of CO2 over long periods .
We need to provide information and advice about the advantages of these products throughout Europe .
Without forestry there can be no wood industry .
So I hope that the House will accept this logic and vote for Amendments Nos 1 and 2 .
However , I would still like to comment on a couple of points .
As regards the environment , we should not fool ourselves .
That is my last point .
To sum up , this report creates a negative impression .
We only have to remember what happened to the steel industry .
I do not think it makes sense to subsidise this sector .
Is this also the opinion of the Commission ?
If this is the case , what are its plans for the future ?
Wood regrows , it rots and finds its way back into the natural cycle from which it came .
This is an area where the European Commission should apply SLIM .
And perhaps the wood sector is an ideal one for introducing model procedures , possibly including BEST .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commission and Mr Seppänen , who produced the draft report .
The report calls for the inclusion of the peat industry in the forest cluster .
This is most justified .
The renewability of peat is an incontestable biological fact .
The time necessary for the process is longer , however .
Peat is a biomass fuel with a slow renewability rate .
When we speak of peat it is worth reminding ourselves of scale .
We therefore do not touch the capital , because the interest is enough to get by on .
The Commission is happy to adopt the report and the draft resolution .
They are in line with the Commission ' s views .
Among the most important priorities is ensuring there is this high level of professional skill .
Five main areas of the industry form one of the biggest industrial sectors in the European Union .
It gives direct employment to 2.5 million people , and indirectly the figure is much larger than that .
Studies on the printing and mechanised industries have already been published .
The next forum is to be held in Stockholm in June .
It is becoming ever more important to take account of sustainable development .
We have lost 210 staff in all .
We have had to combine departments and offices .
I will be in contact with representatives of the industry after this debate .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
Madam President , I wish to put a request to you and the House .
Mrs Pack , you will understand that it is not for the President to comment on these observations .
Mr Ferri is absent this afternoon and cannot stay behind to present his report .
Madam President , we are quite happy for you to temper justice with mercy , as it were .
Mr Swoboda , I agree entirely with you .
We are continually having to postpone the discussion of reports .
What is the point of the European Parliament ?
This is the issue being raised again .
Madam President , I want to make two brief points in this context .
I think it is undemocratic to keep raising it .
We do not need to start a debate on the issue .
It is impossible until next December to get on the Strasbourg-Brussels flight at 4.30 p.m. on a Thursday .
That is not acceptable .
We are asking that they should not be penalised financially .
Mrs Bordes , this is not a procedural motion .
United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva
Both the Committee on Transport and the rapporteur have improved on the Commission 's proposals .
Hedkvist Petersen Report ( A5-0381 / 2000 )
' What do you mean , Mr Fatuzzo ? ' replied the pilot .
' Flying is the safest form of transport there is .
It is on the roads that most accidents happen .
In Ireland , however , the fall has only been by 13 % .
Congratulations are due Mrs Hedkvist Petersen on her conscientious , thorough and innovative work .
This could be achieved , specifically , in the form of a proposal for a directive .
I shall therefore vote in favour of this report .
This is an intolerable situation .
Money spent on reducing road accidents is money well spent .
Inadequate road safety costs society and the Member States a great deal of money .
Things are certainly moving in the right direction .
This trend must now be maintained and strengthened .
The number of fatalities and injuries on Europe ' s roads is not something which is predetermined .
We must make improving road safety a political priority and provide the financial means to match .
So how is it therefore possible to find solutions standardised for the whole of Europe ?
Shocking statistics show the severity of the problem .
Of course , the numbers vary from country to country .
Every person killed is one too many .
Every case is an individual tragedy which tears apart a community .
Poli Bortone Report ( A5-0358 / 2000 )
That is why I voted for this report .
Costa Paolo Report ( A5-0345 / 2000 )
In this case , the matter is charging for transport infrastructure .
What planet do we think we are on ?
Obviously , infrastructure needs to be meticulously maintained and modernised .
But what funding must be sought ?
Karamanou Report ( A5-0373 / 2000 )
For these reasons , we will not be able to vote for the report .
Transport problems can only be solved on the basis of a European consensus .
This applies also to the field of transport .
That is a development to which the Swedish Christian Democrats do not wish to contribute .
I take a very serious view of further increasing the costs of transport for people and goods .
It is patently obvious that this will be a merciless blow which will fall hardest on the sparsely-populated counties .
Madam President , there is a lot of talk about quotas in Mrs Karamanou ' s report .
I have abstained , and this is why .
That is why I am not so keen on quotas .
This signal could be misinterpreted or even turned against us to score political points .
Women are demonstrably holding leading positions in our parties .
There are various different systems in the EU Member States for ensuring that women are properly represented numerically speaking .
That is the way it should stay - that is what the principle of subsidiarity is all about .
I voted in favour of the Karamanou report .
Women are universally under-represented where decisions are made .
These were the reasons why the Communist Party of Greece abstained from the vote .
However , two aspects which I think essential are missing .
Seppänen Report ( A5-0384 / 2000 )
develop forest-based industries within the framework of viable development ;
ensure that natural resources are renewable ;
formulate a forest strategy and coordinate the various Community policies which affect it ;
The Seppänen report has not received our support for a variety of reasons .
That , however , is not justified .
It is therefore essential to plant a diverse range of species .
It is therefore necessary to circumscribe market forces .
It is regrettable that the report does not take this sufficiently into consideration .
More sustainable alternatives include gassing and composting .
After all , wood burning must also be included as a source of carbon .
It therefore deserves more of a boost than proposed by the rapporteur .
( The sitting was suspended at 12.55 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
This morning , the President saw fit to propose postponing Mr Ferri ' s report .
There are other Members , too , in exactly the same position .
Mr President , I cannot agree with Mr Deprez .
He claimed that his report had been on this morning 's agenda .
Read the agenda .
That means that we have half an hour to consider this topic .
However , the basic problem here is something quite different .
Mr Posselt has in fact said everything that needs to be said .
Tactics like this are capable of achieving just that .
Now , commenting on what Mr Deprez has said , I have this to say .
Mr Deprez , on behalf of your group , you asked for the debate to be adjourned .
We cannot vote on this point now .
You cannot do so now .
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
Trial of former Khmers Rouges in Cambodia
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
However , the content of the adopted legislative draft has forced us to make a number of critical comments .
Mr President , I believe Mr Belder has just hit the nail on the head .
Of course it is positive that this trial is now actually about to take place .
It is important for Cambodia to deal with the ghosts from the past which are still haunting the country .
However , we are not wild about what is about to happen there .
It is a matter of better some of a pudding than none of a pie .
We cannot do much else other than go along with it .
Cambodia ' s parliament has given its consent .
Firstly , every court in Cambodia will have difficulty guaranteeing its own neutrality .
How neutral can those judges be ?
We therefore hope things will go well , but we have major doubts .
Finally , we also need to look at the involvement of China in all of this .
The sick were dragged from the hospitals or left to die .
What followed was to shock the world .
The deliberate deaths of between one and two million people constituted a real genocide .
Amnesties are sometimes necessary if unpalatable .
If that proves to be the case we should wish them well in this venture .
The form the trials will take has been agreed between the UN and the Cambodian government .
This concern is well-founded .
It is not always easy to distinguish clearly between the victims and the persecutors .
Restarting a spiral of large-scale revenge is to be avoided .
Cambodia is the only country in Southeast Asia to have abolished the death penalty .
No one cared about Cambodia .
It is now due to be ratified by the Constitutional Council and King Norodom Sihanouk .
So there are very good reasons why we should follow this closely .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place this evening , at 6.30 p.m.
Visa requirements between Russia and Georgia
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
Mr President , we can certainly support the thrust of the present resolution .
Naturally , we expect both parties to display the will to enter into joint consultation .
It is precisely this specific humanitarian problem which poses a direct threat to the authority of President Shevarnadze .
In short , they are a continuous source of unrest in Georgia .
Mr President , Commissioner , he who sows the wind shall inevitably reap the whirlwind .
These words take on their full meaning when applied to the countries of the southern Caucasus .
What region of our own continent , or the next , is more crossed by tensions and issues ?
What region has a greater need for pacification and normalisation ?
In order to obtain a visa , they have to travel back to Tiflis .
In some cases they cannot even afford to do this .
And the other side is that these disruptions will also have economic consequences .
Georgia fears that it will become isolated .
So these are truly dramatic events .
That is why we are calling on the Commission to act here .
We need to work together to come up with solutions which will promote a peaceful way forward .
We all know what these reprisals are about .
That is why I would like to call on the Commissioner to pay even greater attention to this region .
Humanitarian aid in particular has a strong stabilising effect in addition to its purely humanitarian function .
Mr President , I wish to begin by saying a few words about humanitarian assistance to this region .
But we are still there .
This , of course , has caused a great deal of concern .
The immediate reaction was to withdraw from Chechnya .
However , many organisations in Russia have urged us to reconsider this and to come back .
As a humanitarian provider this puts us in a dilemma .
We have to find a balance that is ethically acceptable as a donor .
Let me turn to Georgia .
I say this as a European .
Russia too has no interest in seeing increased instability in the Caucasus .
It deserves our support .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place this afternoon at 6.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
Situation in Turkish prisons
The remedy cannot be blind repression and paranoia about security .
It is up to the government to act .
It is not easy .
The prisons themselves take on symbolic significance .
The situation in the prisons becomes yet another facet of the armed struggle against the established government .
We should keep this perspective in mind .
The response by the security forces is not the cause but the consequence of the problem .
I know that the Turkish authorities are greatly saddened by recent events .
They see this as part of the natural process of adopting the acquis .
I remember the scenes on the BBC .
And , of course , three Turkish soldiers also died .
And what is the upshot of all this bloodshed ?
That is our main demand .
A great many of the prisoners in Turkish jails are , after all , convicted for political offences .
It stands to reason that they will continue their political struggle as political prisoners .
The situation is totally impossible for Turkish society and the Turkish Government .
A totally different approach must be taken .
The battle between different forces must be fought by peaceful means .
The Turkish Government must show the way .
But unfortunately we cannot .
This would certainly defuse the situation in overcrowded prisons .
Fifthly , we must demand a change in Turkey 's laws .
The real question is why there are so many people in prison .
This is simply unacceptable in a modern democracy .
I should then like to point out that every crime has its perpetrators and its accessories .
There are those who commit the crime and there are those who aid and abet .
Turkey is a candidate country for membership of the European Union .
However , there is evidence of doublespeak on several counts and the matter is very serious .
I personally am in favour of Turkey 's European prospects .
This conflict of words paints us into a political corner .
And the prospect of adaptation must be an absolute effort as far as we are concerned .
Situation in Algeria
So our own message is not compassionate but political .
That , ladies and gentlemen , is the heart of the matter .
I am thinking in particular of the other countries of North Africa , Morocco , Tunisia and Libya .
Yes , there are external forces at work in Algeria .
Mr President , Commissioner , we must not lose hope .
It is Europe ' s duty , and it is also in its interest .
Despite the civil concord law initiated by president Bouteflika , there has been no halt to the violence .
In this context , one question arises .
What is the meaning of the apparent impotence and passivity of the armed forces ?
Algerian society is deeply stricken by widespread corruption and social and economic exclusion .
Algeria has just experienced its bloodiest Ramadan for two years .
This information is obtained mainly from the newspapers .
Mr President , much has already been said by other Members .
Finally , I think we should consider sending a delegation to Algeria .
This silence is in stark contrast with our condemnation of what else goes wrong in the world .
The massacres in Algeria have not ceased .
People continue to mysteriously disappear .
Torture is still the order of the day .
That is twice as many as under the Pinochet regime .
But little of these promises has been translated into action .
People still go unpunished .
Barbarians who in the dead of night carry out monstrous slaughterings , continue to get off scot-free .
Similarly , security troops who are guilty of wrong-doings are not being brought to justice .
Plenty of reason , therefore , to take the Algerian authorities to task about this .
But why , in fact , is this not being done ?
Is it because of the French business interests in the former colony ?
Are the Member States keeping quiet because they are hoping to secure some lucrative business deals themselves ?
Are we fearful about Algerian terrorism in our own countries ?
Or is it mainly the fear of further fanning the flames of Muslim fundamentalism ?
The most fundamental task of the state is to protect its people .
It is shameful how the Algerian authorities do not come up to the mark in this respect .
The violence has got to stop .
My question to the Commissioner is the following : what is the latest ?
For we cannot keep quiet any longer .
The health of certain of these prisoners is a matter of serious concern .
It calls upon the Turkish authorities to seek a peaceful solution .
In any event , the Turkish security forces should exercise restraint .
The violence , however , produces new victims every month .
We continue to raise these issues at every level of the political dialogue with the Algerian authorities .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
Depending on when the debate ends , the vote will take place at around 5.30 p.m.
International Criminal Court
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
The deadline for the states to sign this Treaty of Rome was 31 December .
We all know how difficult is was to bring it about .
At the time , 120 countries voted in favour and 7 against .
The support for it is far too widespread for that .
They are thinking about it , but it has not yet happened .
It is important for Europe to take the lead .
We can take action , and it is important that we do so without further delay .
But it is Mr Hans-Peter Mayer who will be speaking for our group .
I simply wanted to clarify that for you to avoid there being any confusion about who will speak .
Thank you , Mr Posselt .
You are as it were our resident lookout .
Nothing escapes you !
Thank you for pointing that out .
That obviously applies even more to the other major players on the international scene .
Those objectives have been achieved .
Our post also gets mixed up sometimes for the same reason .
Some people are asking where the International Criminal Court will have jurisdiction compared with the courts which already exist .
The International Court of Justice in The Hague rules on international disputes .
War criminals will no longer be able to hide behind the borders of sovereignty .
Therefore I believe it is imperative that the Member States set an example .
It is now time for the remaining Member States of the Union to follow suit .
Cynicism is an easy option and I will not indulge in it .
We must now call upon those parliaments to ratify the Treaty .
History teaches us that we must never forget .
Therefore , look back across the last millennium .
Words are not enough .
The time for action is now .
As co-author I urge the House and the Council to support this motion .
Only the Netherlands has not , although it campaigned exceptionally hard for this Court and also for its headquarters .
We therefore wonder what lies behind this .
Earlier we spoke about Cambodia .
We are debating the former Yugoslavia .
The Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague is very commendable . It needs our support .
This is scandalous .
This is first and foremost this Criminal Court .
The Commission will provide further support for these activities this year .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at around 6.30 p.m.
Earthquake in El Salvador
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
Members of the Commission , let us see if , this time , we can make it on time .
To spend so late is to throw money away .
To be effective , aid must arrive at the right time .
If we cannot do it any other way , let us send aid by means of the Member States .
Let us not make fools of ourselves again .
There are continual aftershocks in El Salvador and even in Nicaragua .
This situation occurring in Central America is nothing new .
Central America is one of the world ' s poorest regions .
It is vital that the Commission implements its reconstruction programme for Central America .
The scale of the earthquake was considerable .
The PPE-DE Group supports the motion for a resolution tabled by several groups in the European Parliament .
This is a convincing example of solidarity .
On that occasion we were able to rescue very many people who had been buried alive .
This is a great joy .
It is excellent that Europe has sent help so quickly .
That is why we are glad that this motion has been drafted jointly by several groups .
As for Mr Knolle , I hope that he does not encounter any stone-throwing foreign ministers .
Honduras will receive EUR 15m as debt alleviation from us because of this .
I can only agree with the criticism .
I myself have characterised this as a real scandal .
This is pathetic .
So EUR 80m out of EUR 250 are now set to work .
Things are finally starting to happen on the ground .
They are two totally distinct types of activity and this has to be borne in mind .
But this is bad enough .
Let me now turn more specifically to the terrible situation in El Salvador .
It left yesterday .
On Monday I decided that the first response in terms of money should be EUR 2 m .
This would cover the things that we knew would be necessary in any case .
So poverty is dangerous , and this has to be kept in mind .
My view here is that we need additional resources for this .
So I thank you for the very strong support here .
We will come back on how to do these things .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
( The sitting was suspended at 5.15 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m. )
I have not received an official request , I was in fact waiting for an official request .
Therefore , I assume that you have received it .
And , again , as far as I am aware , this document is valid .
This certainly shows that the President of this sitting is utterly impartial .
I have not received this document , but I take it that what you say is true .
Those who were in the Chamber just now know what I mean .
If I remember correctly , Mr Deprez wanted his report to be postponed .
Now I do not know why I have been given the floor first .
As rapporteur , he has in fact not yet told us why he is requesting this postponement .
That is why it would be only fair for you to give him the floor first .
Afterwards I will give my opinion and that of my group on this .
As a rule , we ask for a speaker in favour of postponing the report .
However , I would , naturally , like to allow Mr Deprez to speak .
That is why I request that this report be postponed until Parliament ' s next part-session .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in principle I support Mr Deprez 's request .
On the other hand , the responses to this are far from systematic .
On Monday , Mr Seppänen said that his report was too important to be taken on Thursday evening .
This morning nobody protested against this .
His request was granted , and Mr Deprez sat there and did not protest .
This is looking increasingly like a Punch and Judy show , I really do have to say .
I should like very clearly to oppose this postponement .
Mr Schulz , Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and I are Members of this committee .
We can air our views on this issue , and we should go ahead with the debate .
However , I would hope that proceedings could be more orderly in the future .
Therefore , I can take 20 minutes .
Mr Deprez , I shall apply the Rules of Procedure .
You have been allotted five minutes and I shall allow you to speak for five minutes .
Apart from cases involving family reunion , applicants for long-stay visas are subjected to a preliminary in-depth enquiry .
The objective of the French Republic is simple and is very clearly stated in the Explanatory Statement .
Ladies and gentlemen , the choice of legal basis is never an innocent choice .
Mr President , I am grateful for the opportunity to speak for the Committee on Petitions .
We believe we need political coherence in our policy-making in this area .
The lack of such coherence partly explains the argument over the legal base .
But this is also precisely what this proposal - which is perfectly sensible in practice - is suffering from .
But you cannot treat cancer with aspirin .
Practical easing of restrictions in the interests of people , yes .
Mr President , I should like to express my satisfaction .
This would have meant that we would have had to listen to Mr Posselt for a whole fifteen minutes .
Imagine that !
Now this cup has passed from us and we can turn to the issue addressed by Mr Deprez .
For once I will dare to take up something which Mr Posselt said .
There is no strategic plan , particularly in the Council .
I say this as a point of principle to the Member States and the Council itself .
My second point is , why is there no strategic plan ?
There is no strategic plan for one simple reason .
It is only people who are subject to restrictions in the European Union .
They are subjected to these restrictions because of a defence mechanism .
( Applause )
Yet , the citizens of Europe expect a clear and consistent overall policy on migration .
The issue is to facilitate the free movement of migrants who return home regularly , whatever visa they hold .
This is where the difficulty lies .
Mr President , I absolutely agree with Mr Deprez .
That is why I welcome the broad thrust of Mr Deprez 's report .
I welcome his refinement of the French proposals .
This is a guarantee .
We should welcome it and therefore welcome his report .
I welcome Mr Deprez 's report .
The Commission accordingly shares your rapporteur 's position .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
VOTE ( continuation )
And that is what I have done , Mr President .
We should like to thank the Fatuzzo family for their comments on the Deprez report .
For these reasons , we voted against the Deprez report .
Today , such discrimination has been made commonplace by the Schengen Convention and by communitising policy on migration .
A good deal of trafficking goes on in consulates because so few visas are issued .
That is why I shall vote in its favour .
Adjournment of the session
That concludes the agenda .
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
( The sitting was closed at 6.15 p.m. )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday , 18 January 2001 .
Announcements by the President
Please be assured that you can count on the European Parliament ' s solidarity .
Ladies and gentlemen , I invite you to observe a minute ' s silence .
( The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence )
Ladies and gentlemen , I have a statement to make .
Like him , having returned , I can today say , " I am back ! "
I am certain that all democrats will rejoice at this principled and just decision .
Thank you , Mr Dupuis .
I did of course send a message to this effect to the Indian authorities immediately .
( The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence )
That is the beginning of totalitarianism and that is why I left them .
( Applause from the centre and left )
I call on Mr Newton Dunn to resign .
This was an enormous tragedy and the most serious aspect is the fact that six people were killed .
As Mrs Figueiredo stated , we hope this House will support us in Strasbourg .
Thank you , Mrs Frahm .
I have certainly taken note of your comment .
I would therefore ask you to take action accordingly .
These factors meant that all of the country ' s actions to control the floods failed .
Madam President , I too would like to express an opinion on the issue raised by Mrs Frahm .
It does not offer any valid proposal to resolve the political conflict in the Basque Country .
Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam . . .
( The President cut the speaker off )
I do not know if he is referring to the centralism of Spain in relation to the Basque Country .
The whole of this Parliament is therefore in a position to consider itself a victim of ETA .
Well , ladies and gentlemen , despite all of this , we will always continue to defend freedoms .
Economic and social cohesion
The next item is the Commission communication on economic and social cohesion .
I give the floor to Commissioner Barnier .
It assesses the results achieved by the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds .
The second issue is enlargement .
This is where the main challenge and the real change lie .
There has been progress .
Per capita income in these regions has moved closer to the Community average .
It has increased from 63 % in 1988 to 69 % in 1997 .
Disparities continue to exist and are even being exacerbated .
How can we address these issues ?
We are part of a European Union which wishes to formalise its structures of solidarity .
The debate is only just beginning .
I do not have any decisions to offer you , just some thoughts , perhaps .
Human resources , too , must be taken into account , since that affects employment .
For whom do we implement cohesion policy ?
How are we to carry out this cohesion policy ?
We did not , at this stage , wish to carry out assessments or budget estimates .
It would be too early ; we would be putting the cart before the horse .
Let us first discuss objectives , content and European priorities .
Only afterwards will we have to find the resources to support these priorities .
I see that figure as a reference point .
I am thinking here of the common agricultural policy .
It does not put forward any decisions , it merely opens the debate .
I should like to hear your views on this .
Mr Hatzidakis , I go along with your analysis , of course .
I formed my own assessment in the same spirit and on the same bases as yourself .
It would not , therefore , be fair .
Mr Hatzidakis , you tell me more money will be needed .
At this stage , I can express only a personal opinion .
We have not yet reached the point of discussing the future Financial Perspective .
I have only given you a rough indication , and a personal opinion at that .
I see this as a reference point .
That is all I can say for the present .
The Commissioner and Mr Hatzidakis said that regional disparities will become twice as great .
It is clear that there will be a cap on budgetary contributions .
The current annual allocation is approximately EUR thirty billion .
That is why I shall fight to ensure that we continue to have public intervention in Europe .
The current system will actually remain in force until the year 2006 .
You may be able to assuage quite a number of fears with your answer .
In that case , we should probably have to tackle the issue of finance .
I am here to listen to your views .
EUR 4 billion are available in Category VIII for the year 2002 .
Where do you stand on this ?
Mrs Schroedter , we do need time .
This is the real weakness of the candidate countries whose regional divisions have not existed for very long .
The Voivodships in Poland have only been in existence for two years .
We attach great importance , therefore , to using these pre-accession funds as usefully as possible .
I also agree that the Structural Funds used have been effective and positive .
However , for this very reason I believe it is necessary to specify something else .
I would like you to be more specific , Commissioner .
Let us be specific , because disquiet in those regions will only be prevented by clarity .
We are only launching the debate .
The budgets have been determined ; the regulations have been defined .
All these EU regions have received guarantees until 2006 .
This is a truthful report .
So there is a problem , but there is no need to panic .
Once again , then , there is no need to panic .
We are going to have to find a solution to this .
My question is quite simple .
I want us to discuss solidarity and to reach agreement on our political objectives .
So , discussing the money involved at this stage would be a poor way of opening the discussion .
I know perfectly well that we shall have to discuss finance when the time comes .
That is my first point .
My second point is solidarity .
We must continue to promote solidarity between States .
I therefore feel that this form of redistribution is quite fair and quite efficient .
When people do not have enough to eat , they emigrate .
The Agenda 2000 reform was limited to maintaining the status quo in the CAP .
Mr President , what I have to say to the Commissioner is far simpler .
( The President cut the speaker off )
This would also allow us to spend the money in a more targeted way .
I ask this because if we have the budget that has been approved , then we will have money .
My second question is : what will happen to the outermost regions ?
You have not said anything about these regions and they are of concern to me .
This is , of course , precisely what cohesion policy and regional policy are about .
The plans made in Berlin seem to me perfectly adequate .
You mention changing the criteria , if necessary .
Mr Nogueira , I do not have sufficient time to take part in a debate on globalisation .
There is a specific paragraph on these regions .
As Mr Prodi requested , I do a great deal of work for these seven outermost regions .
I am working within the scope of the Community ' s current jurisdiction .
Thank you , Commissioner .
That concludes this item .
The next item is the joint debate on :
Development must respect human dignity and the protection of the environment and health .
Economic development must not disregard human rights or mutual respect for differences .
We have attempted to make our hopes practical and realisable in the short and medium terms .
There are many areas of conflict , which are liable to jeopardise the entire Barcelona Process .
Civil society has demonstrated a clear lack of interest .
In my report , I attempt to present a number of proposals intended to overcome this situation .
I shall now introduce the six major areas to focus on .
Firstly , I think that the free-trade area must be set in the context of a proper strategic approach .
Secondly , migration must be placed at the very heart of development today .
I also feel that we should introduce a special travel visa for those involved in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership .
We should also harness immigration to assist development in countries of origin .
Immigrants contribute to the development of the country of origin .
I would urge the Commission to go further by financing immigrants ' micro-projects .
We must also facilitate the enhanced association of the Euro-Mediterranean states that so wish .
My fourth point is that we also have to reform the management of the MEDA programme .
The Commission tends to be critical of our Mediterranean partners .
My sixth point is that considerable funding must be allocated .
I think the Commission should take this situation into account .
Furthermore , we believe that culture promotes wealth .
At the same time we wish to draw attention to education .
We are therefore not talking about clichés , but about reality .
What we need , however , is many small projects .
The concept of prosperity includes both economic growth and social equilibrium .
The presidency is therefore going to arrange a meeting involving the 27 countries ' trade ministers .
The need for regional integration is another important issue which should be discussed .
It is also important to encourage and support trade and cooperation between the partner countries themselves .
This is a neglected area in which a great deal must and can be done .
More than five years have gone by since the Barcelona Process was embarked upon .
This is what we expect .
I would like to focus on human rights and the rule of law .
It would be cause for great hope if the moratorium were to take effect immediately .
One of these concerns political priorities and the other concerns the coherence of our actions .
They are two real priorities but they are different .
Let us not , therefore , set political priorities against one another .
More is requested and then is not used .
Therefore , somebody should ask ' why do we not readjust the figures ? '
But what we really need is a budget and it must be used .
This approach would favour North-South relations without the element of domination .
The same applies to human rights .
The same applies to the European Union ' s respect for the rights of all citizens .
I am thinking here of the need for a more integrated and more generous approach to migration .
So this report puts foreign policy back into context .
Recent statements made by Mr Solana confirm the need to prioritise .
Ideas on paper hardly ever turn into reality in practice .
Both reports are disparaging about those other responsibilities .
However , I do not agree with this line of thought .
Enlargement deserves all our attention in the near future .
If we want to do this properly , we will have our hands full .
Incidentally , my tone was not one of regret when I mentioned our former access to the Mediterranean .
In summary , balance on our southern border is essential to our stability .
The Mediterranean provides a dramatic example of the issue of war and peace .
The issue of North-South relations is spectacularly alive in the Mediterranean .
The issue of regional responses to the challenges of globalisation is being raised in the Mediterranean .
Without this practical step , the funds will frequently not be exploited , as is the case at present .
The first two goals have not been achieved , as Mr Naïr has said .
Unfortunately , this is true .
We must admit that we have failed spectacularly on this issue .
This is an area we must tackle if we genuinely want to implement our policy .
The goal of the Barcelona Process is undisputed .
Equally , it is important to ensure that no Mediterranean country is excluded .
The problem is that we are not doing that properly .
The association agreements are dead letters in many respects .
Europa was Zeus 's wife , the mother of Minos , Sarpedon and Radamanthe .
Why am I telling you all this ?
We need to get a few things straight .
Mr President , the Barcelona Process was not lacking in good intentions or financial resources .
Despite this , the outcome was meagre , which is very disappointing .
There was too much gesture politics going on and too little capacity to carry out the plans .
Three quarters of the committed funding never left the kitty .
We have a very long way to go before a free-trade area is established .
The economies of the partner countries are still very vulnerable .
Their mutual trade is still being restricted and has protectionism written all over it .
The Barcelona Process can only succeed if the Mediterranean partners continue to work on democratisation .
The human rights clauses in the Association Agreements should not remain hollow phrases .
Any violations should be penalised by a drop in financial support .
We must bring our ambitions into line with the degree to which they can be implemented .
Fine words and fine budgets are not enough to guarantee stability and welfare .
Mr President , the Mediterranean is the cradle of European civilisation .
I hope that improved relations between the EU and North Africa may result from the Mediterranean programme .
I have a question for the Council .
Is it the case that , if there were to be underspending , the money could be relocated ?
These three points should guide us in our relations with our Mediterranean partners .
We would hope so and we shall all keep an eye on this .
The Barcelona Process should not be held hostage to the Middle East peace process .
This imbalance becomes more explosive with every passing day .
The past year has not lived up to these expectations .
This is disappointing management .
Neither must we forget dialogue , as well as the promotion of fundamental rights .
I am first Vice-Chairman of the delegation for Malta .
They are not allowed to bid for as much work as they want .
We need more transparency in the spending that is agreed upon .
That is an abuse of the position that we hold here .
I welcome this debate .
I think that dialogue with the partner countries is extremely important .
Allow me to comment briefly on some of the interesting contributions to this debate .
The obvious answer from the presidency is yes ; they must be coordinated .
We shall , and must , be able to devote all our energies to these two areas .
The aim is for these agreements to be ready by 2010 .
They form the basis for a regular , deeper and extended political dialogue .
Mr Martin spoke of the importance of the cities ' role in Mediterranean cooperation .
I can only concur with what Mr Martin said .
The Council therefore sees this as an aspect we should like to try to cultivate further .
Mrs Napoletano discussed the incredibly important cooperation taking place in the legal sphere .
The Swedish Presidency wishes to promote cooperation in this area .
We shall be organising a high-level meeting and a seminar .
I believe it was Mr Obiols I Germà who talked about the lack of symbolic specific action .
Mrs Carlotti touched upon the same subject .
Mr President , it gives me very great pleasure to participate in this debate on the Mediterranean today .
It has been an extremely good debate .
That document was on the table , that document was the principle agenda for that meeting .
Let us not underestimate our contribution .
As events have sadly proved , it is going to be all too necessary .
This was clearly not the right moment .
Nevertheless , in substance a good deal of progress had been made towards agreement on this instrument .
Our communication is unequivocal on this subject .
The European Union should use all appropriate fora to press for progress on these issues .
I am happy to confirm that we are achieving considerable progress on this .
Help from the European Parliament in this respect would be most welcome .
In due course we also need to tackle the issue of agricultural trade .
The development of subregional trade needs to be accompanied by greater subregional cooperation .
Trading opportunities will not be used unless the infrastructure is there .
We must harmonise measures relating to the single market .
Taken together , I am confident that they will bring about serious improvements in the years to come .
I am delighted to answer " yes " - in the affirmative .
It is a positive " yes " rather than negative or equivocal " yes " .
I note the opinion that the amount made available for the period 2000 to 2006 is insufficient .
I was not surprised to see that mentioned in the report .
I fully agree with these .
The question is how best to go about it .
I fear that financing micro-projects is not the answer .
These are not cost-effective and they are wasteful of staff resources .
I propose to make a concerted effort in this sense and to try to generalise the approach .
I warmly welcome Parliament ' s activities in this respect through international contacts at all levels .
I hope Parliament will understand .
That is what we are trying to do .
This is not a virtual policy .
It is a real policy that we want to make work in real time .
Situation in the Middle East
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in the Middle East .
During the negotiations in Taba , the parties came closer than ever before to a negotiated solution .
Despite the difficulties , the parties have not wanted to forfeit the progress achieved in spite of everything .
In Taba , the parties negotiated directly with each other and without any third party present .
The ever lengthening crisis has presented the Palestinian population with severe economic and humanitarian problems .
In a statement of 22 January , the General Affairs Council called upon Israel to resume these transfers .
The human rights situation continues to give cause for concern .
The European Union has intervened with the Palestinian Authority in connection with the death sentences recently carried out .
We shall continue to monitor these issues .
I believe that we should focus the debate on at least three questions .
The first is what will the political scene in Israel be like after the elections on 6 February ?
Certain significant measures were adopted in relation to Syria .
Unfortunately , however , 2000 ended without us being able to achieve peace .
Let us do everything possible so that 2001 might truly be the year in which we do achieve it .
The current situation is , of course , still very fluid .
Progress has been made in all areas .
There has still been no precise decision on this .
However , there is still a desire to make progress and to reach a definitive solution on Jerusalem .
It is also important to highlight the constructive behaviour of the countries in the region .
I am sure the Commission will also do so .
We will continue the generosity that the European Union has always shown .
That is what I can tell you at the moment .
Naturally , we all hope for progress in the peace talks .
Naturally , we are all seriously concerned about the loss of life on both sides .
We also remain concerned about the humanitarian situation in the West Bank and Gaza .
They are even affecting the import of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian territories .
The situation has deteriorated further , and staff and patients are prevented from even reaching the hospital .
The security of staff engaged in humanitarian assistance has been severely compromised .
I very much regret that the situation has continued to deteriorate .
However , we have continued to make our position crystal clear .
We have demanded that the remaining closures on the Palestinian economy should be lifted .
I am very grateful to Parliament and the Council for making that prudential transfer possible before Christmas .
We need to look at the likely situation for the rest of this year .
As our resources are limited , we need to examine carefully how to proceed further .
The Palestinian Authority is now facing an ongoing fall in revenue and a rising deficit .
They will need to adjust their policies .
Let us hope that you are right !
Firstly , the Oslo fundamental agreements still exist and continue to be in force .
Now that would be what I would call a new peace process .
( Applause )
Thank you very much , Mr Sakellariou .
Mr President , the EU is the key donor to the Palestinian territories .
The human effect of the closures is possibly even worse .
It is therefore of key importance that we continue providing aid .
I am delighted that the Council and Commission share our view .
I returned from the Palestinian territories last Sunday together with a delegation from Parliament .
The Union must also assume its political responsibility .
That is due not least to the dissension within the Union .
We must make sure this discussion does not become black and white .
By maintaining a certain degree of neutrality , Europe could , in fact , make a valuable contribution .
Both sides of this conflict are violating agreements .
We must call them both to task about this .
In all truthfulness , I am not holding out too much hope for the future either .
In that sense , I share the view of Mr Sakellariou .
With regard to the Palestinians , I believe that the European Union should act as follows .
Finally , I would like to comment on the Palestinians .
Local elections are required in order to enhance the legitimacy of the Palestinian Authority .
The truth of the matter is that Peres knows that what Arafat is saying is true .
Her epic ordeal was recorded in the Israeli newspaper Ha ' aretz .
People who are seriously ill are turned back and medical staff beaten up .
Was there something wrong with the trees ?
Arafat himself said that his movements are hampered .
Others have spoken of the tragic stifling of the economy .
These are economic disasters whose effects will be felt for years to come .
( The President cut the speaker off )
This is what they fear .
But who fears , exactly ?
The Israeli democracy is afraid of this , but you could not care less !
For heaven 's sake ! What sort of Europe is this ?
Israel must become part of the European Union , one of our borders .
This view bears witness to an understanding of the political constraints of the European Union in the Middle East .
The only country which can provide credible security guarantees for both sides is the United States . "
Why is this ?
The European Union must accept its due responsibilities , alongside our American counterparts .
That is my first question .
In the face of all this , it is impossible to preserve a neutral stance .
This is why we cannot fully share Mr Solana 's optimism .
Commissioner Patten tells us that we must look beyond the immediate crisis .
We agree .
If we do not believe in Europe ourselves , then their confidence will be of no avail .
It is critical , first of all , because the election of the Israeli prime minister is imminent .
This week , all sense of time has been suspended , pending the election results .
President Clinton had made the peace process one of the priorities on his agenda .
Only time will tell how George Bush and Colin Powell now see their role in the Middle East .
I ask the House and I ask the Commission and the Council to proceed with caution .
I ask the European Union to do what it does best .
It has an influence over the Palestinians and it should exercise that influence .
We are , unfortunately , still in the old situation of ' paying but not playing ' .
Mr President , we have reached yet another crossroads in the peace process .
A great deal will depend on the forthcoming elections in Israel .
The most recent wave of violence and terror must be condemned in any event .
It is a test of our credibility at international level .
I am still reeling from the shock .
The living conditions were dreadful and shocking .
The situation was explosive to an unimaginable degree .
The concept of a state of war best describes the situation .
Incidentally , gatherings of people are dispersed by Israeli soldiers often enough .
We experienced this at first hand because our group came under fire .
Fortunately no one was injured .
I am a friend of Palestine and I am not an enemy of Israel .
Finally , I would like to make a couple of points .
Perhaps they would come to understand better .
People of Europe have no idea of this .
It is unbelievable that there is a situation where the Palestinian Legislative Council cannot even meet .
There is wrong on both sides , of course there is .
Where have they managed to secure peace , and maintain it too ?
I completely agree with Commissioner Patten .
This is completely unacceptable .
Mr President , the situation in the Middle East currently presents us with a paradox .
The High Representative also seems to share this optimistic point of view .
I address my comments to the Council and to the Commission .
Why do I say this ?
Partly in response to Mr Morillon .
True enough , there may still be differences of degree in the way this is felt .
I believe the same applies to the High Representative , who can certainly answer that question for himself .
Ladies and gentlemen , some of you have recently visited the region .
I must tell you that I have been visiting it since 1991 , more or less continuously .
We have seen an enormous amount of suffering .
I would like to say that it is not advisable at the moment to appeal for frenzied optimism .
This is an historic step forward .
The European Union has proposed possible solutions to these four issues .
This position indicates that a policy of settlements such as the current one is not acceptable .
There will be no definitive solution without a solution also to this issue of the settlements .
We know this and anybody who has been involved in this horrific conflict knows this .
Hence the frustration of some and the lack of security of others .
And that , to a large extent , explains why the current debate is experiencing such difficulties .
And that was my hope .
Unfortunately , you are perhaps right and it has been a vain hope .
I would be extremely sorry if that were the case .
I want to make this point absolutely clear .
No sign of anti-Semitic content has been found in these new books .
I hope that has made clear the Commission ' s position on this issue .
It was worth making the point at this stage , because it has been raised before .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Patten .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the debate on the following oral questions :
We are all aware of the situation in Columbia .
We are familiar with the statement by the General Affairs Council of 9 October last year .
In fact , we believe this to be the position of the vast majority of Member State governments .
I hope that this is also the view of the Commission and the Council .
The European Union is aware of the serious , multifaceted and interdependent problems faced by Colombia .
We believe that an integrated strategy is absolutely essential if it is to be possible to solve these problems .
The Commission has undertaken to coordinate the efforts to set up an aid package of this kind .
The Commission does not intend to take part in any initiative with a military dimension .
This package of European support covers contributions both from EU Member States and the EU itself .
The Commission will also continue to provide humanitarian aid to assist the all too many displaced people in Colombia .
This non-programmable aid has amounted to EUR 24 million since 1997 .
This year it is envisaged that about EUR 10 million will be made available for these kinds of interventions .
These areas of cooperation are also priority areas for the government .
The EU intends to make its contribution effective as soon as possible .
This will constitute effective implementation of the concept of a peace laboratory .
The conclusions of these experts ' mission should be available by the end of February .
Apart from our financial commitment , Europe is also increasing its political role in the conflict .
One last word about the risk of an extension of the Colombian conflict to neighbouring countries .
Many have raised their concerns , notably Ecuador and Brazil .
There has been , indeed , an increased flow of refugees crossing the border in the affected areas .
The European Union must adopt this distinctive approach and promote it at international level .
In short , a different plan is needed , one based on negotiation .
If indeed there are some , I would like details on them .
What type of programmes are they ?
These three problems can only be solved in interrelation to one another .
Many Columbians live in dead-end situations .
More than half the population earns less than two dollars a day .
The inequality is shocking .
Three percent of Columbians own 70 % of the land .
Many farmers rely on growing coca and poppy as their only means of existence .
Their fight for power is essentially a fight for drugs .
Lawlessness reigns supreme , and human rights violations are legion .
That is why it is essential for farmers in Columbia to be offered a reasonable alternative to producing drugs .
This should also be the focal point of the European contribution .
However , we should at the same time not be naïve .
We need to realise that a hard-line approach is sometimes required vis-à-vis the drugs mafia .
It is not always possible to win over big-time villains by negotiation alone .
Europe should mainly focus on the outcome .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , exactly which Plan Colombia are we discussing here ?
This programme of aid to the Colombian Government aims to combat drug production and trafficking .
By providing the Colombian Government with weapons .
This military equipment is apparently going to be used to destroy cocaine plantations .
Exactly who does Plan Colombia see as the opposing forces ?
Officially , it is the Colombian State combating drug traffickers .
There is no question of sharing the responsibility with America .
Responsibility for what ?
Millions of deaths ?
Can we accept Plan Colombia ?
I support the view of the Committee on Development and Cooperation .
Holding talks is the way to achieve peace , not waging war .
Herein lies the difference between the European Union and others who have intervened .
The opportunity before us is there for all to see .
Unfortunately however , this whole period has been characterised by a conspicuous absence of peace .
What can the European Union do , faced with such a situation ?
I welcome tonight , Mr Danielsson ' s statement that European support will be independent .
Mr Salafranca says there is confusion .
There is no confusion .
Mr Salafranca condemns abuses by left-wing and right-wing groups .
Mr President , I would just like to endorse everything that Mr Howitt has said .
It does not work and it is also an ecological disaster .
It knows very well that there are clear links between the paramilitaries and the armed forces .
Any plan which includes a military element is not a solution for Colombia .
It just exacerbates the situation .
How many resolutions have we adopted ?
That too is our mission .
I only need to respond to a few of the speeches .
We have our own plan .
We do not need to relate to Plan Colombia .
What we are doing forms no part of it .
Many of these activities will be carried out in cooperation with or through different NGOs .
This will in fact strengthen the message that we are trying to get across .
It is not just an issue of whether or not we are using NGOs .
This will depend very much on the subject and activity from case to case .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Nielson .
Mr President , I wish to ask for clarification on two points .
This is an issue I wish to see clarified .
I would like clear information on this matter .
Thank you very much , Mr Salafranca , for that clarification .
If there is any change to that , this Parliament needs to be notified far in advance of tomorrow .
We are not suggesting that .
He has good faith , but his government has not delivered the goods .
Mr Howitt , I am not going to reopen the debate on this issue .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
( The sitting was suspended at 8.45 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
I will summarise the progress made in three points , and I would like to welcome you Madam Vice-President .
We were able to get the Council ' s agreement on three points .
But in any event , we need the network to be maintained by the users .
Parliament has fought for this , in conjunction with the Commission .
They will be entitled to do so .
As with any birth , there were people to assist .
I want to stress this in particular , in recognition of her outstanding work .
After that , the Council again took a relatively long time to make its comments .
It is the Council that always has great difficulty in reaching a common position .
So what does this railway package contain ?
I , too , Mr Jarzembowski and a few others , would have liked to have seen something more .
We could have been bolder .
Secondly , regarding the cost structure .
But in the long term the aim must be to cover costs completely .
Thirdly , we have not abolished the derogation for individual Member States .
Overall , I believe it is a well-rounded package with good provisions .
You might say we can go home content tomorrow after the votes .
We have all played our part .
But not so .
Two things are most important .
As I said , I also hope that they will be bespoke and purposeful , which is very important .
Far-reaching changes will not be achieved over night .
So there is no need for hauliers to be afraid .
But the question of labour law and working hours is also important .
Here , too , the treatment is unfair .
Of course , there must be investment in the railways .
This investment is necessary .
I say that especially because of the impending enlargement .
If enlargement means having a lot more heavy lorries on our roads , there will be opposition .
Mr Jarzembowski said that the objective was for the user to pay the cost .
Our group is in favour of improved competitiveness in the railways and liberalisation .
It will ease the problem of both road and , furthermore , air traffic congestion .
Mr President , Commissioner , rapporteurs , congratulations .
That applies to both public transport and freight .
This can be put down to one simple reason .
Research has now provided adequate evidence of this .
Therefore , if it had been up to my group , this conciliation would not have taken place .
Ladies and gentlemen , the same applies to the notion of safety .
Mr President , it is to ' railway speak ' that we owe numerous figures of speech .
For example ' the train has departed ' is what we say when we arrive late .
Unfortunately the same can be said of our train .
The statistics bear this out , I am sorry to say .
There are other , better signals too , a green light as it were .
We must not overlook what has been achieved in the way of positive results .
Interoperability is the next item on the agenda , and we are currently setting the points for more intermodality .
In my view , it is the citizens of Europe who are the winners .
We must reverse that trend .
The railways ' organisational structure is also at fault .
Where the marginal cost charges are concerned , I also think this is a good conciliation .
In this way , it will be possible even for long-distance operators to compete .
This is important in Europe , where distances are long .
I think , then , that we have a good result and I want to thank everyone involved .
Finally , I hope that we can all make sure that it is turned into a reality .
Glaciers are being melted at a faster rate than steel rails are hardening in the mould .
Why should a private-sector supplier be a priori any better at this than one under public ownership ?
I believe that having equal conditions of access for all will not prove profitable in every case .
Private companies must make a profit or else face their demise .
This will require uniform framework conditions .
This has nothing to do with competing for services to the general public .
The reports by Mr Swoboda and Mr Jarzembowski set the right tone .
In freight transport , the advantages are tangible and plain for all to see .
It must be able to flourish on a Community-wide basis .
Only in this way will the railways become a real alternative .
The same conditions must apply to passenger transport as apply to freight transport .
If this is adopted , there is a risk that rail safety will be jeopardised .
However , there could have been other options .
Besides , that is what rail workers are calling for .
We must move towards establishing public Europe-wide services within the framework of a common policy ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Four people lost their lives and many were seriously injured .
No remedial action was taken .
This is not merely a domestic issue .
It has European ramifications as far as the Channel Tunnel work is concerned .
I believe we took a significant step in that direction on 22 November last year .
The problem is that it does not work .
Let us be clear about this .
It is a revolutionary change , and we need to be aware of what we are seeking to achieve .
Some people have complained that we spent too much time on this , others that we rushed things .
Many of you , ladies and gentlemen , have raised this issue .
The White Paper will cover the matter of non-discriminatory levies for infrastructure .
I trust I can rely on your support regarding the adoption of the directive on interoperability .
We must not confuse the issue , ladies and gentlemen .
Furthermore , nobody is talking about privatisation of any sort .
There is no question of privatising the operators and especially not the infrastructure .
On the contrary , investment in the infrastructure will be called for .
This kind of thing is always happening .
This can be achieved through specific measures of this nature .
In producing this proposal for a regulation , the Commission has now created a legal basis .
The proposal provides for regular reports to be made in future to the European Parliament and the Council .
I would be grateful if the Commission could use this positive definition in future .
Once again , I would like to thank you warmly for this .
Let us hope that it will , nevertheless , serve its purpose .
I think Mrs Mann has produced an absolutely outstanding piece of work .
I would like to focus once more on two particular points .
This brings me to the second issue , that of the fundamental organisation of trade policy .
It is all a matter of having the right rules .
What it comes down to is fine-tuning , and to some extent , to information too .
What we need to do is set about convincing them .
So it is a pity that she missed the opportunity to address it in a more political way .
That is why I do not want to restrict it to trade alone .
I believe there are still some marked differences in this respect .
There are some excellent programmes when it comes to Japan .
The Gateway to Japan project is also outstanding as a trade promotion project .
Other industrialised countries could emulate it .
Take for example my area , Asia , which keeps me extremely busy .
I believe we should underpin the ASEM Process much more firmly in political and parliamentary terms .
One thing we must be sure to do is hold a conference for parliamentarians before the next ASEM meeting .
So regardless as to what the legal situation is , Europe and Asia must grow closer together .
I want to comment very briefly on two other matters .
You know , colleagues , how much emphasis this Parliament has put on the TLD .
Of course , the tone is not one of party politics .
A good example is the Istanbul World Radio Conference last spring .
We are extremely grateful to Parliament for that .
The cornerstones of these relationships are the common values and the similar interests that we share .
We would greatly improve efficiency by aiming for economies of scale and create optimal flexibility .
I would like to emphasise the importance the Commission attaches to this proposal .
Let me turn to the 14 amendments adopted by Parliament .
I am delighted to say that the Commission can accept 11 of them .
Ms Mann and Mr Ferrer , referred in particular to Amendment No 5 .
Ms Read pointed out that the Member States are very sensitive to this issue .
Thank you very much , Mr Patten .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Energy efficiency labelling
Things would have been even worse without the energy star programme .
It has been officially adopted in Australia and Japan for example .
When they are asleep their electricity consumption is cut on average from 100 watts to 5 watts .
We believe the current legal base is the correct one and we join the Commission in their suggestions .
The energy-star label should help to promote energy efficient standby equipment .
The fields of telecommunications and information technology would seem to be particularly important in this respect .
So although no demands are made on the capacity of the piece of equipment , it still consumes energy .
None of this is problematic from a technical viewpoint any longer .
However , I feel we need to go further still .
Hence my appeal to you to adopt these amendments .
We are all agreed on this matter .
The present trend in matters of energy efficiency is not always the best possible alternative , however .
The information must be easily intelligible to all .
Merely to mention wattage means nothing to many people .
Please take this into account .
On the other hand , we do in principle accept Amendments Nos 5 , 11 , and 15 .
That concludes my summary of our position .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Recognition of professional qualifications
This draft directive amends and supplements a total of 10 directives , some of which date back to 1977 .
The President has saved me some time by already enumerating the professions concerned .
Why did the vast majority of us insist on this Conciliation Procedure ?
There are essentially three reasons .
In such cases you can make a claim to make good the loss .
But when it comes to health , the damage cannot normally be made good .
That is why we have compensation for pain and suffering .
There is therefore a lot of interest in these matters .
Secondly , and this brings me to my second concern , we have the internal market .
Has he undertaken further training ?
Has he kept himself abreast of developments ?
This brings me to my third reason .
Parliament is keen that we should produce readable texts .
I have already mentioned that I am a lawyer .
We must produce consolidated texts more quickly in future .
Briefly , three more basic principles .
Firstly , the Commission has said that it will produce consolidated texts in future .
Secondly , lifelong learning .
We must not just keep on talking about it , we must make it a requirement .
I believe we have reached a good compromise .
Thirdly and lastly , the specialised training course for general practitioners was extended to three years .
Mr Wieland possesses both qualities in good measure .
We can be slightly proud of that .
There is something wrong there .
We must put it right quickly .
First , that it affects only a small number of EU citizens .
Second , that the Treaty provides only a limited basis in law .
Things will go a lot better then , you will see .
We need rigorous enforcement of all legislation so any complaints can be dealt with quickly .
I would commend this report to the House and ask it to support it .
The Commission is delighted that the Council and the European Parliament have reached agreement .
It will be of great benefit to the mobility of employees , and that is important .
Thank you for your kind words , Mr Bolkestein .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Multidisciplinary Group on Organised Crime
Methods change and so we also have to learn to deal with crime in different ways .
The emphasis on the problem of delays is particularly positive .
I thank Mr Ferri for his work .
But European cooperation is more urgent than ever .
There is a great need for the Council to act .
The Netherlands use their own classification of urgency instead of adopting the urgency of the requesting State .
The creation of contact points alone is still no guarantee of the qualitative leap needed in European cooperation .
There are already examples of where cooperation and coordination work .
However , we still have differences of law within the Member States .
We still have different legal systems , for instance .
I am particularly happy that Ireland gets honourable mention because of the Criminal Assets Bureau .
Finally , sanctioning Member States is a very dangerous area .
It is better to rely on cooperation ; the carrot works a lot better than the stick .
The Commission broadly supports the analysis and the vision laid out by the rapporteur .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
( The sitting was closed at 11.35 p.m. )
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
She was a recognised democrat and historian .
I have three times attempted to gain the support of this Parliament in condemning this law .
The issue is being decided at present by the Court of Human Rights and will not go away .
( The Minutes were approved )
Decision on urgent procedure
( Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure )
Progress of EU and Member State measures to combat BSE
Nonetheless , let me very briefly summarise the main events of recent weeks .
Important new measures came into effect on 1 January .
A working document summarising the responses was circulated to the Agriculture Council on Monday last .
This set the agenda for the Agriculture Council on Monday .
They are also based on the opinion of the Scientific Committee .
They will , of course , result in further controls and potentially very significant costs .
I would like now to turn to the proposals which the Commission will put to the Standing Veterinary Committee .
Firstly , the one relating to mechanically recovered meat .
I might add that the use of mechanically recovered meat is increasingly repugnant to consumers .
The processed meat industry has also called for this ban .
The proposed measure should therefore be very welcome to both industry and consumers .
We also need to reflect however if these changes can be properly enforced .
For example , might there be control problems in distinguishing between different fats .
If so , how do we ensure that the replacement fats are safe ?
However that is the current situation and I intend to put this right .
This is in keeping with the opinion of the Scientific Steering Committee .
Again , however there are important issues which need to be addressed .
Where should the vertebral column be removed .
There are also risks of microbiological handling due to the increased handling involved .
Similarly we need to be aware of the impact on consumers .
Finally , which Member States should be exempt from the requirement ?
These are all issues which the Commission is urgently considering and will address in its proposal .
I am aware that the issue of controls is a concern .
In this respect , the replies of Ministers to my letter of 4 January is reassuring .
The Food and Veterinary Office will continue its programme of inspections in this regard .
I believe it has been invaluable in ensuring that controls are actively implemented .
It should therefore , I believe , be replicated at Community level .
That is still dogging us .
We would therefore welcome your comments on this .
Here too , the question of uniform consumer protection arises .
Then we also take account of the financial aspects .
( Applause )
Mr President , we are in exactly the same situation as we were six years ago .
Mr Byrne intimated as much .
What was done then about removing risk material ?
What is the matter with them ?
And there is an end to it .
Not here a little loophole , there a little loophole !
It is a fact of life .
We have moved forward at a snail 's pace .
That is fine as long as we move forward .
What else do we need to do ?
We need to do the same with animal fats .
That is out of the question .
Fats must be sterilised by pressure cooking . End of story !
No other method should be allowed now .
We must minimise the risks , that is obvious .
You said something quite wonderful , Mr Byrne and I should like to pick up on it .
What do we do about the Member States which are BSE-free ?
That is when I lean back in my chair and think to myself : here we go again .
I have heard it all before in recent years .
Exactly which Member State is BSE-free ?
And may I ask : how do they know ? Do they look inside the animals ' head ?
We too want to do likewise .
Then we shall see which Member States block everything again and we shall publicise the fact .
I wonder just which Member States think they can hold out now .
I welcome and thank you for your monthly reports !
We must no longer blame anyone else .
Under pressure from which lobby ?
Has this self-centred policy now been abandoned ?
I very much fear that , if they started looking , they too would find cases of BSE .
The last meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers was no exception to this rule .
These shortcomings betray a degree of blindness and , at times , genuine breaches in European construction .
The financial shortcomings , on the other hand , are clear , both at Community and national level .
Both the Community Treaties and national constitutions impose the obligation of protecting citizens ' health .
At times we appear to be our own prisoners .
So what are we going to do now ?
Are we going to replace animal meal with genetically modified soya , imported from the United States ?
Agenda 2000 laid down a reduction in aid to livestock farmers .
We were aware of the consequences of this .
For example , what are we to do with the animal meal ?
We are to burn it .
A further question is what we should feed to cattle as a protein supplement .
So what should our approach be in the face of all this ?
In France alone , the beef and dairy industries account for 400 000 jobs .
They can no longer afford to keep livestock on their farms .
Milk producers are exceeding their quotas .
Consumers , worried and disorientated , no longer know what to buy .
Today there are only post mortem examinations .
What has happened to the research into blood tests ?
According to Commissioner Byrne , a patent application is pending .
Are we doing all we can to support research , especially public research ?
The systematic slaughter of herds is expensive and ruins farmers ' selective breeding programmes .
This systematic destruction also disposes of healthy carriers of the disease .
How should the meal be stored , burned and replaced ?
Yet Europe continues to take farmland out of production under the set-aside scheme .
An exceptional situation calls for exceptional measures .
The price of public health is well beyond the means of the agricultural budget alone .
The Commission does not act , it reacts .
It is not pro-active enough to get a real grip on the situation .
Many of the questions which bother the people affected have yet to be answered .
How do we explain the different prices for BSE tests in Europe ?
What will we do to address distortions of competition ?
Why is there no effective help for the innocent victims ?
We are helping the wrong people .
In countries which cannot incinerate , cattle are left standing in their stalls .
The people affected cannot reasonably be expected to shoulder the burden .
Seventy per cent of the supplementary budget has been earmarked for this alone .
Why are BSE tests on live animals not being promoted or imposed ?
If we lose the farmers , we lose our very existence .
We must not let ourselves be engulfed in this wave of panic , because we bear political responsibility .
As I said , we bear political responsibility .
We are living through a veritable Europe-wide tragedy .
The establishment of extensive farming practices will automatically regulate production .
This is what they rightly expect of us .
Let me give an example .
But just think if we could seize this opportunity .
A wise old man once said that chaos is a neighbour of God .
Mr President , BSE is still a danger .
The danger has not been averted .
Unfortunately it was closed too late .
What is being done now is a step in the right direction .
But fat is still being added , albeit heat-treated fat .
Is it sterilised enough at 133 degrees ?
As we know , these prions are clearly proving to be resistant to heat treatment .
The second problem is the brain .
We still have a situation in which the brain from animals under 12 months old can be used .
We can also use pigs ' brains .
The proof of the sausage cannot be in the eating .
The third aspect is testing .
Mr Böge said earlier that we want to test after 18 months .
This too must be guaranteed and we must not let up in our pursuit of this objective .
Commissioner , albeit somewhat belatedly , we are taking stricter and stricter measures .
I refer to coordination and control .
Legislation on inspections , for example , is making no headway whatsoever at European level .
My second point concerns alternative solutions .
Other Members have raised the same point .
What is to be done with the meat and bone meal which has to be destroyed ?
What is to be done with the dangerous substances which we remove from the food chain ?
I know from my own country that this is a problem .
As far as I know , we have about EUR 1.5 billion in our coffers .
What are we going to do ?
We want more credible answers .
The European Union and its Member States must acknowledge their mistakes .
In the United Kingdom we see this with some sympathy .
People will say to me : Well , yes , you were first .
We were first in the whole cycle from complacency to despair and back again .
Every question I now want to ask the Commission comes from that experience .
Firstly , the extent of BSE .
What are the tests showing ?
What do the Member States themselves say ?
Thirdly , what capacity do the Member States have for destroying the materials that are now being removed ?
Which Member States have the incineration capacity ?
Are some still saying that they will put this material into landfill ?
These are all serious questions , which we know you will try to answer .
So I welcome the ban .
But is it really necessary ?
Whatever happens , all these safeguards must be monitored carefully .
This position is illogical .
There is no doubt about that .
We need to take action now across Europe .
I am a farmer who farmed through the BSE crisis in the UK .
I saw the value of my cattle drop to virtually nothing .
They must be destroyed .
( Applause from the right )
I can assure you of that .
The second point is that the funding is therefore not complete .
It merely constitutes a beginning .
Just consider the environmental levy on certain products which is applied in certain EU countries .
How do the Commission and the Council deal with this ?
The final point is to look for a solution .
That is not the issue .
It is about food safety .
The politicians in Europe had better be careful about using this crisis for their own political ends .
This initial information which we have been given is without doubt most comprehensive .
Of course , there is always some cause for objection with most measures .
A few speakers have already referred to tests .
I have heard that the abattoirs are simply refusing to slaughter animals .
What is being done ?
They are being clubbed without being tested .
That is just not on .
We must intervene here , we must sort this out throughout Europe .
But we also need clear-cut , comprehensible laws in Europe .
We shall be dealing with hygiene regulations shortly .
We need to stand together and give Europe clear-cut laws .
That is the only way to get a grip on the problem .
Mr President , I will be very brief .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr Nisticò , your question is not a point of order .
The Commissioner has the floor .
The consumption of beef in the UK is higher than it was before 1996 .
Why is that the case ?
What lessons can we draw for consumer confidence from that ?
Therefore their confidence rises and they consume beef .
A number of you mentioned the question of testing .
This was discussed in the Council last Monday .
Testing at 30 months remains the norm , but will be kept under review .
A huge number of tests under way will provide invaluable information within a very short period of time .
This will put us in a much better position to decide if further needs to be done .
The removal of the vertebral column has been a requirement from 1 October .
The question is how and where .
Then appropriate decisions can be made in the light of that situation .
References were made to the reform of the CAP .
That is not to say that we are going to abandon the idea of the industrial production of food .
We cannot do that .
But there is a desire from consumers that we should address the question of the natural production of food .
My distinguished predecessor Ms Bonino had something to say on the subject of enforcement .
Of course , enforcement of measures is a key issue .
The Food and Veterinary Office has a key role to play .
You made very relevant comments on fats also .
It is not just a question of banning them .
Animals have to have fat in their diet .
The issue is where is this fat going to come from and are these fat sources safe .
The opinion of the Scientific Steering Committee might need clarification on this particular aspect .
There was considerable discussion in the Council last Monday on this issue .
Any increase in budget must now be agreed unanimously by all Member States .
That is a matter for each individual Member States .
I have said that on a number of occasions .
That undermines consumer confidence .
I have said that on a number of occasions and that message has got through .
This is an issue which must also be addressed .
They are found in fat .
It is practically impossible to filter out dioxins .
They have to be tackled in other ways and we are working on this at the moment .
Someone asked the question as to how mechanically recovered meat is going to be dealt with .
Well I have say that it is going to be included in the definition of an SRM .
That will be done in a manner consistent with the legislation as it currently stands .
Mr President , allow me to make a comment to Mr Byrne .
It is perfect for the calves .
The debate on the statement by the Commission is closed .
Substances having a hormonal or thyrostatic action and of beta-agonists
There are six of these .
According to that assessment , there were different levels of risk factor .
All the hormones involve certain risks . Above all , they are carcinogenic .
One hormone , oestradiol 17ß , was worse than the others .
It is extremely urgent to take this matter further .
Firstly , there is the environmental argument .
It is dangerous to use hormones in this way .
Secondly , there is the argument on the grounds of animal protection .
In the light of such considerations , there is a general obligation to make an ethical assessment .
We should probably have no right to effect such a transformation .
I support the changes that have been made .
So we must be particularly vigilant with regard to the substances that are administered to livestock .
Recent studies have shown that oestradiol 17â is carcinogenic .
As Mr Olsson said , it is unethical .
The definitive ban on using oestradiol stands to reason . The substance is carcinogenic .
It is important for us to retain political responsibility on this matter .
This opinion was reviewed and confirmed in May 2000 .
For the five other hormones under consideration , the need for further information was identified .
This measure will be kept under regular review and is thus fully compatible with our international obligations .
I am most satisfied that the report supports this approach .
Many of you here know my view on this issue .
Someone said that this is a political issue .
I emphatically reject that proposition .
It is a scientific issue .
That is the very reason why this issue was considered in the WTO .
I have been through this before .
I have had this debate with Parliament and I know what is going to happen later in the day .
Members of this House will arrive in here to vote on this issue and they will follow the whips .
It will have a role to play in rapid reaction .
Sometimes that will mean a legislative response introduced by the Commission .
But if it can only be done by codecision we will have a delay .
I will begin with the amendments the Commission cannot accept .
Amendment No 1 focuses on a well-founded decision on maintaining the ban .
The Commission cannot accept this amendment as it prejudges the outcome of any possible future research .
This is not acceptable .
Rather the WTO requires parties to evaluate the risk on the basis of all scientific data .
This study should be made available to Parliament in the near future .
Thank you , Mr Olsson .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
New frontiers in book production
This is why this report is excellent .
I would like to thank the rapporteur for all the work and the research she has carried out .
It is a field which is continually changing .
Reading is a form of consumption which needs to be encouraged effectively .
People have to make choices constantly about how they use their time .
It therefore covers the whole of Europe .
There is already a UNESCO day of reading in many countries .
But I grant the Commission the freedom and wisdom to select another date .
Commissioner , there is no supply without demand .
A second point is market forces .
A book sector which is synonymous with a multiform and cultural diversity must be protected , where necessary .
These are the good points .
On the negative side , access to reading material will be twice as difficult as it is now .
Let us not fool ourselves .
This , incidentally , is a feature of the cohesion policy we are pursuing through the Structural Funds .
Are you aware of that , ladies and gentlemen ?
Let me give you some examples .
This is reflected in our cultural initiatives too .
The first year of implementation of the programme shows that this wish has been fulfilled .
The digital revolution constitutes both an opportunity and a risk .
On the contrary , we certainly can do something about it .
The services of the Commission have prepared a detailed programme for the implementation of the e-learning initiative .
Thank you , Mrs Reding .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place very shortly .

Recitals B and C
Madam President , we would accept this proposal .
Madam President , there is also a possible compromise on the following vote .
Mr President , I was the shadow rapporteur for the PSE on this .
What Mr Miranda says is correct , but it is misleading to say that is an amendment .
There was a genuine , technical error by the services .
For absolute clarity , I have the wording here from the original .
Madam President , I simply wish to confirm Mr Howitt ' s words .
The translation of these versions must be amended .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )

Jarzembowski report ( A5-0013 / 2001 )
I am genuinely impressed by the success of the Conciliation Committee on this occasion .
, in writing .
For this reason we have voted against these two reports .
Wieland report ( A5-0012 / 2001 )
I would thus like to see a single European qualification .
McNally report ( A5-0006 / 2001 )
This is the question which I am still asking , Mr President .
But I wondered , why on earth was this the case ?
The Mann report will not receive our support for various reasons .
First of all , the projects lack a legal basis .
That is right , because these projects do not constitute EU tasks .
Despite this , the Commission and rapporteur have discovered a legal basis in Articles 133 and 308 .
In addition , the Commission proposes one budget line .
Furthermore , the Commission has promised to pull up its socks by carrying out fewer tasks .
The Commission should represent the EU Member States at WTO level .
Its complementary role is manifesting itself in the coordination of Member State activities .
There is hence no scope for further deepening or extending .
That is why a more common trade policy is not expedient .
That is why we abstained from voting .
Muscardini report ( A5-0008 / 2001 )
My country , Italy , is a Mediterranean country .
Nevertheless , the conclusion was soon reached that this instrument was not up to the task .
I should like to address a few words to the rapporteur , my friend and colleague , Cristiana Muscardini .
I , or rather we , therefore owe my friend and colleague , Cristiana Muscardini , our heartiest congratulations .
Naïr report ( A5-0009 / 2001 )
This is a continuation of the previous explanation of vote , Mr President .
It is my view that these are two sides of the same coin .
I must give the rapporteur my sincere congratulations on the work he has done .
To be perfectly honest , the balance sheet is not a healthy one .
In this domain , the imbalance is flagrant .
We are asking our partners to open their markets in the sectors where we are most competitive .
The worst feature of this deplorable attitude is its irresponsibility .
Let us end the hypocrisy and stop declaring our commitment to creating an area of shared prosperity .
This is a miscalculation .
Breathing fresh life into this Euro-Mediterranean Partnership is becoming a matter of urgency .
The rapporteur proposes several avenues for us to explore .
The new international situation undoubtedly presents an opportunity that we must grasp .
The European Union has a role to play in the Middle East peace process .
We can only hope that this intention will be quickly translated into action .
That is why I voted for Sami Naïr ' s report .
The progressive marginalisation of the Christian Maronite community in Lebanon is also deplorable .
The Naïr report on EU Mediterranean policy is more than ambiguous .
It does not provide any basis to establish proper cooperation structures between Europe and the Mediterranean countries .
Frontiers have never stopped the movement of men and women .
To regard them as illegal immigrants is playing into the hands of the mafias and traffickers .
We should resolve to open borders .
For these reasons I did not vote for this report .
Resolution on Plan Colombia ( B5-0087 / 2001 )
Mr President , I wondered why Mr Fatuzzo has nothing to say on this .
I would have thought that he would have had a minute to share with us .
We are being deprived because we have no explanation of how he voted on the Plan Colombia .
Ferri report ( A5-0398 / 2000 )
We do not support the inclusion of the European Public Prosecutor in this text ( paragraph five ) .
And who exactly is talking about organised crime and terrorism ?
We agree that organised crime must be combated .
O ' Toole report ( A5-0005 / 2001 )
Mr President , I should like to explain why the Greens were in favour of these proposed amendments .
That was in fact the main reason for this own initiative report .
So why question it ?
The problem already exists and this would simply serve to completely confuse current policies .
That is no contradiction .
That is why the Greens voted in favour of it .
That concludes voting time .
Adjournment of the session
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament .
( The sitting was closed at 12.15 p.m. )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday , 1 February 2001 .
Madam President , I refer to the draft regulation on European political parties .
This is a bad precedent .
That is my understanding : there will be a resolution , but not immediately .
Thank you , Mr Barón Crespo .
That , then , is the way we shall proceed .
Madam President , thank you for that very helpful suggestion .
Not many of us will be here on Thursday evening , unfortunately .
Relating to Thursday :
The parliamentary reason relates to the work of the committees in this Parliament .
This issue therefore interferes with the activity of this Parliament .
Secondly , there is a political reason .
That is totally legitimate and I would do the same on another issue .
This does not adversely affect the normal working procedures in the relevant committee in any way .
But right now we require some information from the Commission .
We will , after all , not be adopting a resolution , but receiving information .
My fear is that Thursday evening is not the optimum time to try to do it .
I would , therefore , like to clarify matters .
I believe that this is a political issue that warrants discussion .
I have some information for Mr Cox .
This is an extremely demanding process , which really calls for very careful political judgment .
I shall now put to the vote the request to withdraw this item from the agenda .
( Parliament rejected the request )
The PPE-DE Group and certain other groups requested that the subject of euthanasia should be debated this week .
Unfortunately , the Conference of Presidents rejected this request .
That is completely untrue .
We will give you the information .
Then there is no question of insinuations .
I think that when it comes to these matters we ...
And there is another thing .
We are always talking about subsidiarity here in this House .
Madam President , this issue has everything to do with subsidiarity , it has been said .
It is indeed up to countries themselves to pass laws .
With regard to content , it is a matter of showing respect for something which involves everyone very deeply .
It is a false start .
The Cairo Conference and the Beijing Women 's Conference both stated the same thing .
It is unacceptable to turn a blind eye to this grave problem .
Madam President , I have a message for you concerning my colleague Mrs Lucas .
Mrs Hautala , I can assure you that we shall monitor Mrs Lucas ' situation very closely .
Madam President , I protest against the rather intemperate remarks of Mr Balfe .
There is no power under Scottish law to keep people locked up just as long as it suits you .
I think that your intervention with regard to the French Government was fantastic .
But I am taking the floor about another matter .
I should very much like an answer to these questions either this week or next week .
I have already informed the competent services of this but nothing has happened yet .
Perhaps you could do something for me .
We shall look into this matter very carefully .
I think I can safely inform you that there will be some tangible improvements over the next few weeks .
Please join me in welcoming Mr Patakis .
Madam President , I would be grateful for your attention .
There are 30 people sitting up here .
But if someone on this side asks for the floor , it is rare that any notice is taken .
Mrs Flemming asked to speak right at the beginning .
Mrs Schleicher , we take note of requests from all sides of the Chamber .
I think I am right in saying that this rule was received very favourably .
Their relatives have every right to know what became of their loved ones .
I know that the race was won by a compatriot of yours - a Frenchman .
He was gallant and kind in his congratulations .
Request for waiver of Mr Ribeiro e Castro 's immunity
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers
Of the bulk carriers , 69 % were more than fifteen years old .
Two main reasons for these accidents are indicated .
Firstly , the lack of expertise of the crew and secondly , the physical condition of the ship .
This problem is recognised at an international level .
It intends to incorporate the BLU Code , with a few amendments , into Community legislation .
We therefore support the incorporation of the BLU Code into Community legislation .
Emphasis on that point in a few places in the text is in order .
A second point : the captain bears many responsibilities .
They can only do so if they have sufficient information at their disposal .
In this directive , the PSC authorities are at risk of being given extra tasks .
For this reason , the Commission must see to it that these tasks are actually carried out .
Finally , a few more observations about Amendments Nos 14 , 13 and 16 .
The necessary disquiet has arisen over Amendment No 13 .
The voyage data recorder is an instrument for recording travel data .
Information about loading and unloading is not recorded on it .
The effect of this can be found in the Erika II package .
The latter does not have the knowledge for this .
In brief , you should understand that I cannot support Amendment No 13 either .
I hope that my fellow Members see the logic of this .
I am quite unable to support Amendment No 16 tabled by my fellow Members Mr Simpson and Mr Fava .
That is not legally possible .
Anyway , work is being done on this .
I hope that reassures those making the submission .
Erika I has been succeeded by Erika II , and there is presumably more to come .
In this report , we are dealing with safety in connection with the loading and unloading of bulk carriers .
A number of interim measures have been proposed , for example .
It is important to take an overall view of this problem .
There is an explosive growth in the number of shipments .
More and more of the traffic comes from Eastern and Central Europe or from third countries .
The Commission ought therefore to come back with proposals as to how these problems might be solved .
Mr President , I would also like to thank my fellow Member , Mr van Dam for his report .
We support the proposal of the Commission .
So we must do something about it .
We therefore support the report compiled by our fellow Member , Mr van Dam .
My group has two observations to make .
We will not support the proposal on the black box that is made in Amendment No 13 .
What is involved here is the loading and unloading of ships .
It does not involve ships that are sailing .
Secondly , I have tabled an amendment in relation to Article 8 .
I think that is a good thing .
Also the Member State determines who is authorised to do this .
I think that is also a good thing .
Apart from these two points , we are able to support the proposals in general .
Safety at sea is a very important issue .
We must invest in it .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr van Dam , I think it is an excellent report .
I think that the Commission has done its work well too .
That means 780 deaths .
That also means that in large areas of the sea , the environment may become polluted .
We do not need to explore the whole problem of navigation now .
We have already done that before , but the problems with the hull worry me in particular .
This does not quite solve the whole problem of training though .
We cannot accept this , if we take account of the principle of subsidiarity .
This will happen in different stages , but it will eventually apply to all ships .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Maritime safety and prevention of pollution from ships
All other existing committees dealing with related matters will be disbanded .
This is the substance of Article 4 , the basic article of the proposal for a regulation .
Unfortunately , it seems to be a monthly occurrence .
Commissioner , we are counting on you not to lower your guard .
A good example of this occurred during the last few days .
The medium-sized ports will be grateful to you - and to us - if this is done .
In particular , everyone is now aware that the Commission and Parliament are not pausing for breath .
One after the other , we are discussing proposals to improve maritime safety .
Nor should we allow ourselves to let the pace slacken , given the situation at sea .
The public is aware of these issues and the debates about safety flare up at regular intervals .
Europe is doing something about maritime safety and the prevention of pollution .
The Commission has brought forward its proposals in almost record time .
Huge demands are made of the inspectors and we need to give them our support .
The report before us by Mr Bakopoulos makes a valuable contribution to achieving further progress on safety .
The fact that it was approved unanimously in committee is a testament to his convincing work .
I trust that Parliament will be equally convinced when it comes to vote .
It is vital to guarantee that Parliament has the right to participate in the regulatory procedure .
Increased safety is very important for maritime traffic .
Our group supports the main ideas in the report .
The intention of the proposal is to remove the problems mentioned earlier .
Procedures must indeed be simplified .
I truly hope that you do manage it .
Our group will support you .
We are going to make a series of recommendations .
This unbridled unaccountability is not only being maintained ; it is being extended .
Thank you very much , Mr Patakis .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this comprehensive report .
This will mean an intensification of such shipments .
Such an assessment should also be evaluated by the European Commission .
In conclusion , I would like to see the reprocessing of nuclear products terminated at Sellafield .
I must commend the rapporteur , Mr Bakopoulos , on this report .
Once again , my congratulations to Mr Bakopoulos .
I also support the Commission ' s proposal regarding its proposed procedure in this connection .
The proposal therefore constitutes an effort at simplification , clarification and coherence .
We accept Amendments Nos 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 9 and 10 in their entirety .
It does not , however , have a legislative function .
There are therefore two distinct areas of operation .
I want to conclude by thanking you for your contributions and for all your work .
A moment ago , Mrs Langenhagen said that port inspectors have a lot of work to do .
Interoperability of the trans-European rail system
The current situation is extremely complicated .
Parliament voted on a total of 46 amendments which had been tabled .
Approximation of technical standards is an essential and important step if we are to facilitate safe cross-border rail freight .
It was three votes short of being adopted .
This is not just a half-hearted compromise , but a really good package .
My second point is this : can we rest on our laurels now ?
Have we done everything that needs to be done as regards railways ?
Mr Savary has already indicated that there are still some problems to resolve .
The big problem is competition between road and rail .
However , all these issues are very important in the context of enlargement .
The idea got under way during the Finnish Presidential term , and was continued with successfully by France .
There is still much to be done but now the work is off to a good start .
I would further like to thank Mr Savary for also having understood the special needs of Finland .
There was proper consultation .
What we are speaking about here is really a so-called railway package .
I already brought this matter up last time .
I should just like to bring up a few other small points , small in a certain sense .
What we are now going to see is that gigantic investments are necessary here .
A specified language must be spoken .
Which language are we going to speak ?
English , as in international shipping or aviation ?
So , will English also be the language of rail transport ?
That will make all communication very easy .
The trend emanated from a retiring government which is making itself redundant as a result of liberalisation and privatisation .
Much of what we resolved then has now been adopted by the Council .
I congratulate the rapporteur on that outcome .
Unlike Mr Jarzembowski 's proposals , my group endorses the result .
The threats of the twenty-first century reside in a combination of technical development and competition .
In spite of European integration , we still see continuing disintegration of the railways .
International railway regulations are becoming increasingly hard to obtain .
Train tickets to distant destinations often have to be purchased outside the country of departure .
Not any longer .
Four months ago the direct night train from Stockholm to Berlin disappeared .
Within 10 years , there may be 25 or 27 Member States .
The differences between systems will presumably be still greater then .
There is one signalling system in Denmark and a quite different system in Sweden .
We need to harmonise and to become , as the saying goes , interoperable in different areas .
The trans-European railway systems , in particular , constitute an obvious first step .
It is important for this work to be characterised by two realisations .
Rail transport must be subjected to an honest appraisal that weighs benefits alongside costs .
That is a miracle which is still realisable .
The proposed directive being discussed is a rational one on the whole .
In this connection I would still like to remind people about something that is important for Finland .
Finland shares a border with Russia that is more than one thousand kilometres long .
Finland has been accused , sometimes with good reason and sometimes not , of Finlandisation .
For practical reasons we must be able to use Russian carriages and wagons in the future .
In spite of that , there is still a long way to go before we reach the terminus .
Nevertheless , the convergence process needs to be stepped up for the sake of the railways themselves .
The directive , therefore , needs to be implemented as soon as possible .
This is also to be welcomed if an internal market is to be created for the supply industry .
That is positive .
What we are doing through this latest interoperability measure is building a European railway .
And that is exactly what this measure does .
Mr Bouwman asked me some questions and I would like to reply to them .
This is one of the issues that I wanted to highlight .
Some measures will be implemented rapidly , as the rapporteur , Mr Savary , has pointed out .
That will take somewhat longer .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Recovery of cod stocks in the Irish Sea
Mr President , I would like to point out that the rapporteur is not present .
I would therefore like to read out a short piece of text .
I have not been authorised to do this , but I am the coordinator of the PPE Group .
It is very short .
Mr President , I am sorry that Mr Nicholson cannot be here himself today .
Now that I have read out that text , I would like to move on to my own comments .
He was working under great time pressure .
That should give us politicians , and indeed everyone involved , food for thought .
The future of an important and historical sector of the economy in our coastal regions is increasingly at risk .
Stocks have suffered a further drastic fall in all areas .
But we keep coming back to the same question : why did things have to get to this stage ?
Must it always take such horrendous news to stir us into action ?
When will we finally incorporate sustainability into our fisheries policy ?
If we do not at long last collaborate closely , the next crisis could be fatal for us .
For example , the renewed debate on dioxins is deeply worrying .
At the end of the day , we need to be proactive instead of reactive .
When will we learn that lesson ?
The proposal before us is a step in the right direction .
There is still a great deal to do .
Mr President , I thank the rapporteur in his absence and Mrs Langenhagen for her speech .
Mrs Langenhagen has painted a very bleak picture of the state of cod in the Irish Sea .
In 1993 , 11 000 tonnes of cod was caught and in 1999 , 5 500 tonnes were caught .
It is an example to other areas as well .
A similar situation has arisen in the North Sea .
We have to think about the adverse effects on other fisheries when protective measures are introduced .
The reform of the common fisheries policy , I believe , is an opportunity .
We must make sure that we get the reforms right .
I thank the rapporteur in his absence .
There is a case for looking at similar financial compensation measures for these areas .
The CFP review provides a challenge and an opportunity .
I hope that the solution we come up with will be one that actually works .
Mr President , the majority of the earth 's surface consists of sea .
People cannot live there but we make ever more intensive use of it .
The sea has long been regarded as the source of an inexhaustible food supply .
There are still fishermen who believe that the sea remains inexhaustible .
For the same reason , the fishing quotas must be restricted .
The quantity currently permitted is less than a fifth of that at the beginning of the nineties .
That is how exhausted the sea is .
In this way , attention is at risk of being diverted from the necessity of fishing quotas .
Owing to the short-term disadvantages , everyone expresses outrage and opposition to fishing quotas .
This is currently under discussion with regard to the North Sea as well .
Mr President , the survival of cod is seriously endangered in various European waters .
The Commission is rightly introducing measures which should protect this species of fish from extinction .
That is why the Dutch protest and the alternatives put forward do not win approval anywhere .
Closure of an area does not have a sufficient effect on the recovery of the cod .
Neither in the North Sea nor in the Irish Sea .
However , the Commission does not consider the policy to be feasible .
Unfortunately , Mr Nicholson is adopting the half-hearted stance of the Commission in his report .
That just leaves the Commission .
My problems began this morning at a very early point when my flight from Belfast to London was cancelled .
This is not an easy problem .
It is a very serious problem .
For them , this is the second year of closure .
This is what I want to concentrate on .
I have one amendment to my report and I ask the Commissioner to take it on board .
At this moment , the Commission has set its face against accepting this amendment .
The common fisheries policy in its current form has been operating for 18 years .
The system of MAGPs has also been a disaster .
So , the CFP has failed in its core objectives .
Why should we sit back and allow our fish to be plundered and allow our fishermen to be impoverished ?
I do not believe that the common fisheries policy is a failure .
I appreciate his very open and honest attitude to this .
Well , I want to quote a more up-to-date document about the codfish .
The encyclopaedia came to the conclusion that mankind could never exterminate this species .
We have proven both the Bible and this nineteenth-century encyclopaedia wrong .
This is an old story .
It is trying to solve a difficult problem .
For that reason , at this point I only wish to comment on the report actually before us now .
And time is short , because the spawning season starts in the middle of this month .
I shall now turn to the amendment that has been tabled .
Unfortunately , I have to reject this amendment .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Fischler .
And thank you for being so brief .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
( The sitting was closed at 8.30 p.m. )
This year we wish to organise a day dedicated to the euro .
Thank you , Mr President .
Vote on a request for urgent procedure
( Parliament approved the request for urgent procedure )
Commission work programme for 2001 / Nice
I now give the floor to Mr Prodi , President of the Commission .
I will not dwell on the last 12 months .
We also proposed to set up a European Food Agency , which will come into operation next year .
The key to stabilising our continent is our strategy for enlarging the European Union .
That is what we are trying to do right now .
The key elements of this programme are structured around a number of major events .
These are not a random collection of disparate items .
But first , let me describe the Commission 's major initiatives for this year in greater detail .
One of the key goals of our strategy is to restore the right conditions for full employment .
What we need now , therefore , is fresh energy to accelerate action in some key areas .
Secondly , also by way of example , we need to accelerate economic reforms .
I do not need to say any more about this .
A long-term political project of this kind clearly requires effective prior consultation .
Indeed , the developing countries are the key element in the whole process .
We are also ready to cooperate with the new US Administration and Congress on trade issues .
This will require a huge and - in particular - unprecedented organisational structure .
We have taken decisions of historic dimension which will unite the continent .
So what public debate are we talking about ?
Another question : how much social and economic solidarity are we prepared to show one another ?
And again : are we prepared to show the same solidarity when it comes to internal and external security ?
Then : what sort of environment shall we leave to future generations ?
To my mind , these are the sorts of questions we should ask in this year 's debate .
European and national parliaments have the legitimacy of being elected .
We shall then be entering the second stage , following Laeken .
We have got to where we are , and we should be proud of it .
( Loud , sustained applause )
It is absolutely unacceptable .
But it shows where the shortcomings lie .
We need people in government dealing solely with Europe .
( Applause from the right )
Which is why we want structural changes in the Council of Ministers .
( Applause from the right )
You referred to the European Parliament 's involvement in this process .
We should like to be more specific .
My second comment concerns asylum and immigration policy .
Only a common policy can resolve these difficult issues .
But we also call on the Commission to take account of the consequences in its initiatives .
Asylum and immigration policy as a whole must be a priority .
My third comment concerns Europe as a financial centre .
I think we need to step up our efforts here .
My last comment is this : we want a strong , democratic Europe which has the ability to act .
Mr President of the Commission , let us work on that together .
We shall support you in strengthening the Community institutions .
( Applause )
Unfortunately , this is not yet visible in the work of the Union .
We also need a long-term approach to the East .
This is out of all proportion with the relative importance of these two neighbouring regions .
President Prodi called for environmentally sustainable development .
It must be pointed out that last year 50 % of the programme was successfully concluded .
It is to be hoped that next year you will be more successful in meeting the deadlines .
These are the key aspects of the programme .
We have , nevertheless , been the target of criticism , which we must accept and address .
This is what we need .
This means talking about everything , in other words , putting forward a very wide-ranging proposal .
Here , Madam President , I feel I need to make an observation .
On behalf of my group I salute the progress which has been made there .
We are all in this together .
Much remains to be done , but very substantial progress has been made .
It is not simply the acquis communautaire - they are doing very well on that .
I am glad we get a chance to reflect on it and to look at the priorities .
But I have looked at it .
It is 49 pages of high-density non-communication .
It is 49 pages covering 593 different initiatives .
We have to move away from this .
We have to change the way we do our business .
We do not find the answers in here .
I would like to see them .
Is it yours ?
Finally on Nice - on après-Nice - just to make a point .
( Applause )
This means that we shall be leaving this area of taxation to market forces .
Population growth was mentioned here .
In this we all have a great public responsibility .
Madam President , very often strong words are uttered in this House on the subject of our citizens .
I will take one very topical example of this .
But it would seem that there are always problems with this in practice .
No , civil society is very much a reality .
What conclusions do you draw from such assessments ?
What indeed remains of the EU ' s development policy ?
For the other countries , you have traded in the Lomé-style philosophy for a WTO-style logic .
What has become of Europe ' s ambition for the South of Europe ?
The second major priority I wish to ask you about is the new economic and social agenda .
What steps , Mr Prodi , would you be willing to take along this road in 2001 ?
Madam President , the agreement reached at Nice will now pave the way for the enlargement of the Union .
This is really the central dichotomy that exists within the Union at this time .
It is not a done deal .
That is not how political persuasion operates .
The basic problem is and remains : social State or liberal State ?
More State and less market or more market and less State ?
Eurosceptics are necessarily opposed to shifting power from the national parliaments to Brussels .
In short , Nice means less democracy .
We all have a common interest in securing a democratic debate prior to the next treaty .
We want to see the majority of all decisions taken in the Member States and in local areas .
That is a matter we are well able to decide for ourselves .
In the short term , we must consider the method of the future debate .
Fine words , Mr President , but too vague .
I therefore call on you to make some sort of concrete statement .
We therefore expect you too to bear in mind that we need to strengthen parliamentarianism and parliamentary debate .
As a general precept , I am sure you agree with that .
That is what we want and it is here that we ask for your clear , unequivocal support .
Parliament does have its weaknesses , it is true .
The concept of good governance is somewhat of a problem in itself .
I would rather refer to democratic governance .
The democratic decision-making procedure needs to be strengthened , I agree with you there .
It must also be broadened .
Democracy also includes dialogue with civil society . I admit that one hundred per cent .
And this is where we , as parliamentarians , must do more .
Here too you must make a clear , unequivocal statement in support of Parliament .
( Applause )
That brings me to the question of self-regulation , another new buzz word .
Self-regulation is sometimes euphemistically referred to as a " cooperative decision-making model " .
But we can hardly expect the fox to guard the chickens .
Are those whom we perhaps want to control to be allowed to set their own rules in the future ?
I take a different view .
It is out of the question and that is not our position .
The Commission submits proposals . It has the right of initiative .
If there are , then the matter should be referred to the European Court of Justice .
We expect you to be as keen to strengthen Parliament as we are to strengthen the Commission .
( Applause )
We should be focusing policy-making on areas where EU-wide action is indispensable .
We should be ensuring that the principle of subsidiarity is fully respected .
Finally , the annual work programme should come to a vote here in Parliament .
Nice showed the failures of intergovernmental Europe .
It is up to us to make a more persuasive case for a federal Europe .
Mr President , President Prodi , I endorse the call for specific answers .
The political unity of Europe made no headway whatsoever in Nice .
On the contrary , Nice was a renationalisation-fest .
That is by definition what parliaments are for .
I want to raise four points which I feel are important in the brief time available .
We are awaiting European regulations on the use of the Internet .
The consequences will be disastrous if we cannot give a firm , frank , timely response .
Mr President , we have a multitude of outstanding questions post-Nice to which we require specific answers .
Why should the final responsibility continue to rest with the Member States ?
This question relates closely to the definition of the purpose of the European Union .
In any event , this is the way forward if we are to avoid delaying enlargement .
Enlargement is the second major issue on the agenda and we must carry out our historic duty here .
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , I have three brief comments to make .
That is my first question , which concerns the method .
My third point relates to the subjects .
I would advise each and everyone of us to get away from this strange ' post-Nice ' concept .
The promise is binding .
But how is that to be arranged ?
Is the Commission prepared to take proposals and ideas on board and also put them into effect ?
In that case , the EU will be transformed , opened up and simplified .
We know that many citizens want to see a clear constitution .
When are they to obtain one ?
Are the Commission and the Council prepared to give the EU these tools ?
The outcome of the Nice Summit puts people off , unfortunately .
But how ?
This is the major unresolved issue discussed by all my colleagues .
Europe requires a different strategy , a different idea .
The majority must be prepared to understand the reality of the situation without preconceived ideas .
Their failure in Nice is quite enough .
There is the question of what direction to take , but there is also the question of pace .
What is required is more centralism and less democracy .
Of course the people of Europe will resist .
The path that has been prepared cannot succeed . What is happening now is not underpinned by any doctrine .
It seems that we will have to await the Laeken guidelines in order to get under way .
Well , if that is the case , why change the name ?
Its opponents do not reject the name . They reject the convention itself .
We need a strong Council ; we need a Council that participates fully in the institutional triangle .
There are reforms which could be undertaken without revising the Treaty .
The second point I would like to discuss , Mr President , is the White Paper on governance .
This is something we are impatiently awaiting .
This morning you stated your wish to see a Europe that was closer to its citizens .
My third point relates to the debate on the future of the European Union .
We must indeed raise questions as to content ; institutional matters will come after .
We need to distinguish between bodies that are dedicated to debate and bodies that are dedicated to deliberation .
Mr President , enlargement is the most important European project of our time .
I would thank the Commission for its determined efforts .
Now comes the difficult part , however .
Now , it is a question of keeping the impetus going .
That is the Commission ' s objective , and we shall hold them to it .
That is not , of course , what we are doing at present .
You repeated those words several times , and you are right .
Now is the time to do something about it .
Let us have a slimmer , but at the same time stronger , EU .
Let us stop trying to keep far too many balls in the air .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , a spirit is abroad in Europe .
It is the spirit of intergovernmentalism .
The Commission and Parliament must work together closely on this issue .
In cases of doubt it brings us closer together rather than rending us asunder .
The issue of national parliaments has been addressed .
We should not espouse the arbitrariness of so-called socially relevant groups .
This understanding should also be clearly formulated at the Commission .
For the rest , we must consider the role of the national parliaments in the European process .
At the end of the day , it is the national parliaments which control the Council .
That is their job .
They cannot restrict the role of the European Parliament .
It is extremely important to us that this be clarified .
One of the focal points of the Commission 's work will be asylum and immigration .
Finally , there would be a short , sharp IGC to approve the results at the end .
We must also look at the issue of codification of the Treaties .
I would plead for a special procedure .
The technical work would thus be out of the way before we move on to the political work .
I would advocate that way forward .
It is impossible for there to be a definitive distribution of competences between the European and national levels .
The cooperation process is dynamic not static .
Things that are taboo at first , such as the euro , may appeal later on .
This is determined by social need , which cannot be predicted .
That is what we need to see on the agenda , and that is what would testify to courage .
Mr President , I start with the Commission 's work programme for 2001 .
Turning now to the question of the post-Nice process , I would rather see it as our European future .
The only reason people want to be masters of the future is to change the past . "
The four Nice leftovers are not small or casual affairs .
Our view on the core issues is clear .
We want to see a bigger role for national parliaments , on a systematic and constructive basis .
All of these issues need and deserve the widest possible public debate .
The next consultation must be different .
Mr Corbett quoted Chairman Mao .
The EU must sustain a truly open society .
The people must have their say , including those in the candidate countries .
We must also reschedule the next IGC .
There are important questions .
( Laughter and applause )
Targets were set and extra staff were made available .
I hope the Commission will deliver some sound results on that score this year .
Despite this preparation , it would be useful to set down a few markers now .
Our group would also like to do the same in this debate .
This will have to be rectified .
In addition , the highly complex decision-making processes will have to be reformed .
It would be better still if such a clear division of labour could be linked with the European constitution .
Moreover , a convention has the advantage that the national parliaments can take part as well .
The President of the PPE-DE Group complained bitterly earlier on that no one was listening to him .
I intend to focus on the Commission 's plans for foreign and security policy .
There are two sides to this policy , the geographical aspect and the content .
We need a different role , a stronger role in the Middle East negotiations .
Parliament wants a common , not an intergovernmental European security and defence policy .
The Commission is duty bound , Mr President , to reinforce the Community dimension of this policy .
This has been said today by Mr Poettering and many other speakers .
I would therefore like to encourage you to continue along these lines .
Indeed it is almost making itself busy with too many matters .
Hence , my first conclusion is that we should do less and we should do it better .
The Commission has the right of initiative and must present proposals .
I would like to see , for example , a recognition of the interdependence between these areas of policy .
I would have liked a recognition of these inter-relationships , but I do not see it .
We need to have respect for parliamentary procedures in relation to these new forms of open coordination .
I strongly urge you to work on an Interinstitutional Agreement which involves the European Parliament in trade matters .
We believe in reform and democratisation of the WTO .
As far as innovation and research are concerned , we look forward to a detailed Sixth Framework Programme .
The European research area is of course important .
To my astonishment , the next speaker is Mr Ferber for two minutes .
Ferber ( PPE-DE ) .
I am a little concerned about your approach to new governance .
My dear sir , I think you misunderstood me earlier .
The cause of my astonishment was merely your speaking time , not you personally .
Mr President , I fully endorse what Mr Ferber has said .
A German reference would read : tries hard .
And while we are on the subject of good governance : what does good governance mean ?
What exactly is good governance ?
Is it transparency ?
Fine , Mr Prodi .
Not in my book .
Are they any faster ?
And who controls them ?
Who imposes sanctions when they do not function ?
Is that more democracy , I ask you ?
You , Mr Prodi , were selected by the Heads of Government and your appointment was confirmed by us .
Last year there were 500 .
Mr Prodi talks about bringing the European Union and its institutions closer to the citizens .
With regard to this issue we are in a very strange situation .
I would like to ask you : whose fault will this be ?
Today and in recent sittings we have presented a strategic scheduling programme .
But this is politics : first comes the vision , then the practicalities .
Mr Hänsch even talked of producing a single document .
For the moment , this must be carried out within a full agenda .
I am bringing this problem up , therefore , because I feel that it is now inescapable .
In any case , we agree that Parliament and Commission must work together to guide this debate .
I am speaking now only of the model .
But we must go further than that previous model .
I go along with the suggestion made by Michel Barnier and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs .
We must therefore envisage a different body having the same objectives .
There are - and we must work on this - some points that are essential .
This is the essence and the strength of Europe .
In this direction , I believe that we shall be able to work together and produce more definitive proposals .
I would like to make one more observation .
This we must do , and we must accordingly think about the procedures necessary for achieving it .
In short , we agree that we have to go beyond the four Nice points .
In any case , I believe we must be guided by the nature of the task ahead of us .
Another set of concerns has emerged concerning the issue of subsidiarity and proportionality .
An interesting example has been given .
Then there are others , many others , which are completely pointless .
The second point : a desire for Europe to be involved in their peace negotiations .
Clearly , international issues will dictate whether there can be an answer to this question .
The preparation of this year , therefore , is a perfect opportunity to integrate this policy .
Regarding sustainable development , I agree with what has been said .
I would like , once again , to emphasise that this is an extraordinarily important but extremely difficult matter .
I have the same concerns over emigration and internal and external security policy .
I have to say : we are not delaying it .
We must resolve the practical problems to make this possible .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
Industrial restructuring and mergers
Since Lisbon , Mr President , restructuring has intensified further .
We now hear that there are more than three hundred mergers every year .
In this respect , the Nice Summit sent out some very positive signals .
It is our honour , therefore , to ask the Commission to make some specific commitments .
First of all we want better provision to be made for the social effects of restructuring .
I must point out that a further motion was tabled by the Liberal Group .
Commissioners , we impatiently await your responses .
The Dublin Foundation has included this initiative in its four-year rolling programme .
Since then the situation in the economic world has radically changed .
That is the aim of the Commission 's proposal on information and consultation .
First of all the information and consultation dossier must be finalised .
This will surely contribute to a better treatment of the social dimension of corporate restructuring in Europe .
All of these instruments will require the same kind of provisions as the ones found in European companies .
Our idea consists in making these auditions more systematic .
Like every other part of society , businesses are expected to undertake their share .
I know that is your stance on this and I thank you for your support .
The vote on this motion will take place on Thursday .
Mr President , this is never the most gratifying moment to make speeches of this kind .
I am delighted with the Commissioner ' s response .
That is quite logical .
On the other hand , we have a moral duty to engage in consultation .
Volkswagen in Germany is a good case in point .
That is what we aim to achieve with these questions .
Obviously we still have up to Thursday to discuss this .
We want a pro-active approach to industrial restructuring and change .
We want to see that true partnership .
I would also like to make an appeal to the Liberal Group .
We have done that .
We have come up with an oral question and a resolution in a spirit of cooperation .
It would be helpful .
We had the self-same debate exactly a year ago , on 17 February .
Ladies and gentlemen , what is it that Europe needs ?
We will therefore table a number of amendments in the spirit of the Lisbon objectives .
But we will withdraw our resolution .
There is speculation that Danone , a profitable company , is to shed 3 000 jobs in Europe .
Again there has been no consultation with the workers and no discussion about alternative ways forward .
Companies cannot be free to wreak such havoc on people 's lives and communities .
There is a positive framework of controls and sanctions which we can use .
We must make sure they are effective .
It is high time that we provided means to intervene on behalf of employees .
Michelin , Moulinex , Danone and Alstom are not businesses experiencing difficulties .
We shall have to go much further to respond to the democratic demands of the working citizens of Europe .
Any merger contract must include social clauses .
Penalties must also be introduced for failure to comply with the directives on worker consultation .
We shall now proceed to the vote .

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Hansenne report ( A5-0029 / 2001 )
We have therefore abstained from voting on these reports .
Dover report ( A5-002 / 2001 )
The Commission , and this report , now propose waiving this derogation .
We have voted against this report .
We must not do anything to harm the job prospects of young people in Britain .
Sometimes , however , employers take advantage of our young workers and force them to work unnecessarily long hours .
Exploitation is harmful and irresponsible .
The legislation for reducing the working hours for young people already exists .
We just need to make sure that it is used .
The sensible measures put forward by the Commission should encourage the utilisation of these measures .
This illustrates their totally schizophrenic attitude towards Europe .
Savary report ( A5-0016 / 2001 )
A European rail system is an important goal for Europe .
Europe can and must provide us with this as well .
We are sure that Mr Hatzidakis will make it possible . "
This common position incorporates 33 of the 46 amendments put forward at first reading .
This increase has mainly benefited the road sector , particular as regards freight movement .
There are many reasons for the decline in the railways .
One reason is that rail has been organised on individual national lines .
There is no single market for railway services within the Community .
The objective of sustainable mobility is thus closely linked to revitalising the railways .
For all these reasons I voted in favour of the Savary report .
The road transport network is currently saturated and in need of an overhaul .
We must also undertake procedures to increase rail transport in order to relieve the pressure on the roads .
We must express our grave reservations on this count , since we remain steadfastly opposed to liberalisation .
In this respect I am forced to agree with the rapporteur .
Van Dam report ( A5-0037 / 2001 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
This time , I took the advice of Mr Fatuzzo the sailor .
Old , unusable ships need to retire .
This would make sailing safer . "
I do not know whether to thank the MEP or the sailor .
Safety is inevitably sacrificed in the attempt to safeguard the profits of shipowners and contractors .
In 10 years , almost 150 bulk carriers have sunk , causing 800 deaths .
I shall vote in favour of all the proposals to that end .
Bakopoulos report ( A5-0031 / 2001 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
" Of course , " I said . " Be patient .
There will also be reports dealing with your safety as well . "

Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
Here 's to Saint Valentine and here 's to all lovers !
And here 's to the cod as well !
That concludes voting time .
( The sitting was suspended at 12.36 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Industrial restructuring and mergers ( continuation )
And I believe that this is to the liking of the Europeans .
But this construction is taking place at a specific moment , in particular economic , social and political circumstances .
We may ask ourselves : and what about the human factor ?
Secondly , economic competitiveness and a healthy society must not be contradictory terms but rather harmonious ones .
Of course , the participation of the works committees , the representatives of the workers , is expected .
Mr President , globalisation reduces economic distances .
We must commit ourselves to preventing it from increasing social differences .
Do we know how much they have contributed to the impoverishment of people and regions ?
Do we know how those that suffer from them recover from depression and at what cost ?
Who is it that ultimately pays for social restructuring ?
Is it the market or the taxpayer and the working person ?
We oppose the political opinions , in this House or elsewhere , that justify these criminal activities .
They have chosen the only sensible route in this economy dominated by the law of the jungle .
I too am amazed at how often it crops up .
Parliament can no longer tolerate such behaviour .
This sort of news is commonplace now .
It confronts us with the fundamental question as to what actually motivates businesses these days .
Are they only in it for the money or do they have a broader vision and mission ?
I see no evidence of this broader perspective or these more fundamental discussions in the European debate .
To my mind , it lacks coherence in this respect .
I will cite two examples .
As regards the legislation on partnerships , people argue in completely one-dimensional terms from the perspective of the shareholders .
Another example can be found in competition policy .
A Green Paper on corporate social responsibility , as announced this morning , is not enough .
Newspapers may display a certain amount of schizophrenia , but not politicians and policy makers .
Certain parts of the legislative framework therefore need amending and changing .
Restructuring , mergers and takeovers do indeed often have dramatic consequences .
The first is forecasting .
The second is the legislative and institutional framework .
The third strand is specific policy .
Finally , the fourth strand is the role of companies , the social responsibility of companies .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon .
Copyright and related rights in the Information Society
It is an important directive and its path has by no means been easy .
There are many amendments regarding this point which I do not endorse .
We have tabled two amendments which we consider to be very important .
Firstly , the amendment relating to what is known as private copying .
Secondly , another very important amendment is the one relating to the incidental and transitional nature of reproduction .
In addition , there are a number of issues that Mr Boselli and Mr Medina have already mentioned today .
So I am in favour of restricting private usage .
I also have my doubts about the technical measures that Member States are at liberty to introduce .
Numerous problems , numerous conflicts of interest have still not been resolved .
Harmonising cultural traditions is no easy task .
A balance between whom ? Between rightholders and the public interest .
Copyright law must serve the rightholder .
His position must be strengthened for future contract negotiations .
This too is a possibility which we should debate .
I believe that we are favouring the opinion of consumers .
However , what are we trying to make them buy ?
That is the question we should ask ourselves .
You must admit that it is surprising .
That is what will happen to the markets .
To do that , we must - like it or not - assist artistic creation .
That is what my group will try to defend by its vote tomorrow .
We welcome the robust way that he has defended the balance of this directive .
No one pretends that it is perfect .
It is important to emphasise that .
There has been considerable difficulty in reconciling national traditions and exceptions .
There are countries that have levies , for example , on recording media .
This is an enabling , liberating directive .
It gives them the assurance that they will be able to create new works and to get fair rewards .
We have got that balance right .
That is a very important provision .
We have strengthened the review provisions .
We now want to get it transposed as soon as possible .
Why do we want to get it transposed as soon possible ?
This could have been an historic moment for the European Parliament .
But it is not .
As we have found out , the European Parliament still has only one objective : no conciliation .
And then Parliament is asked not to make any more amendments .
We might just as well shut up shop and go home .
Parliament has its own responsibility and it must live up to it .
The common position has dramatically undermined authors ' rights .
So , is there to be a return to all that lobbying ?
Is it not all a bit too soon ?
Everything that can be said about the directive has already been said .
It is therefore a little difficult to begin to speak now .
I nonetheless want to express my warm thanks to our wonderful rapporteur .
We may therefore also consider that essential parts of the common position need to be changed .
That is , of course , a protection of copyright .
But is it the same thing as promoting the spread of science and knowledge ?
Where is the right balance to be found ?
This is something I believe we should reflect upon when we adopt a position on the directive .
Mr President , it is a great privilege to take part in this important debate .
I am a bit sad that the tone of the debate has been in part negative and guarded .
The Inter-Library Loan scheme might become an accidental casualty of change .
Many people feel that these two differing groups cannot be reconciled .
This is no easy task .
The Internet is a powerful tool but it must not be an unregulated area .
Consumers are acknowledged as being entitled to make private copies .
It is only natural that the eligible parties are fairly compensated in return , it is only fair .
So I am in favour of a restrictive definition of private copying .
This new context is constantly changing and raises many questions and concerns .
The directive must balance the interests of consumers and eligible parties .
It is trying to resolve these issues as quickly as possible but in a necessarily imperfect way .
Let us not be naive , Mr President .
Unfortunately , the Commission proposal and the Council common position reveal a degree of thoughtlessness that warrants our criticism .
Unless we achieve this quickly , some of Europe ' s fundamental values will disappear for good .
Why am I defending this opinion ?
First and foremost for reasons of principle .
Is there anything more important than protecting private property ?
But there is more to this debate than principles .
Copying will also cost jobs .
The State loses out on income too .
We must be in no doubt about what it is we are risking .
I would like to echo Mr Rothley ' s sentiments .
The e-commerce directive and this directive must be in line with each other .
The ceiling above which an outsider ' s server may be closed down must be set very high .
I would therefore ask you to support Amendment No 4 .
TV channels must decide for themselves how they make their programmes and the music they want to play available .
I would therefore ask you to support Amendments Nos 31 and 32 .
Copyright is not absolute . Exceptions are required .
Finally , we have a WIPO position to defend , and we must vote consistently .
I am hoping for a positive decision , for then we shall be accepting international responsibility .
At least we now have a standard definition for a few core concepts .
Technical means of protection in particular are developing at a very fast pace .
This obviously includes not criminalising consumers or charging them several times over .
This means something .
It is extremely important that the range of exceptions should be limited .
It is not enough to remove the possibility of using copies for purposes that are directly or indirectly commercial .
Mr President , we need to be clear about what we are trying to achieve in this directive .
They also employ 1.4 million people .
At the same time we must not strangle or restrict freedom of access for legitimate users .
This fits in with the EU action plan and the forthcoming summit in Stockholm .
The fact is that the Internet genie is out of the bottle .
We must not encourage people to infringe copyright .
It is however regrettable that some unnecessary , unhelpful amendments have crept in at the last stage in committee .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I too should like to join the House in thanking the rapporteur .
It is amazing how calmly and composedly he has cut his way through this jungle of interests .
The lobby has already been mentioned .
A great deal has been said about the need for balance .
Parts of the directive penalise the internal market , parts penalise consumers and parts penalise innovation .
That is a directive for a citizens ' Europe .
It offers the citizen security and fair freedoms in the digital world .
Having said that , there is another exception which is more controversial , which is ordinary private copying .
I would lastly express some reservations about Amendment No 11 .
If this amendment is passed , I fear that the broadcasters will have an advantage .
They are getting something for nothing .
Member States are also required to protect copy protection under the law .
In my view , the definition should include the family environment .
The rights , the archives of broadcasting organisations are of immeasurable cultural and historical value .
We must therefore do everything we can to make these archives accessible , including for online use .
I think that there is every reason to offer a separate regulation for public radio .
I say this sincerely .
It is not simply that are not the same , but that they are not even similar .
To try to harmonise them is an heroic quest .
I refer to what has already been said .
That is also an important responsibility at a time when we talk so much about globalisation .
Mr President , thank you for giving me the floor on this important subject .
That indicates the importance , as well as the controversial nature , of this proposal .
The formal decision to ratify the treaties was adopted by the Council on 16 March 2000 .
Throughout the legislative process , Parliament has played a significant role .
Most of those amendments were , in fact , compromise amendments , also on crucial issues .
The Commission is in a position to accept all of the compromise amendments .
We have , however , concerns about some of the other amendments which have been voted .
I shall now say something about each of those amendments , although very briefly .
This directive requires fair compensation for certain of the exceptions , one of which is private copying .
But the issue of sanctions is already adequately dealt with in the directive .
For this reason the Commission cannot see its way to accepting it .
The majority of those amendments have been rejected by the Legal Affairs Committee .
Three amendments , however , namely Amendments Nos 26 , 27 and 28 , are new .
None of those further amendments are acceptable to the Commission .
I should now like to address some of the questions and comments made this afternoon more specifically .
That is particularly the case in relation to the protection of technological measures .
In relation to Amendment No 11 , a similar amendment was proposed at first reading .
I wish to thank Mrs Palacio for her support throughout the history of this proposal .
The Commission would also like to thank the rapporteur and Parliament in general for the excellent work performed .
Deliberate release of GMOs into the environment
We have now completed the process of reconciliation and we have a text for final approval .
We have the precautionary principle reaffirmed .
We have tighter risk assessment of all GMO releases .
We have achieved the phasing out of all harmful , antibiotic-resistant marker genes .
We have a clear timetable .
Steps have also been taken on the issues of liability , traceability and labelling .
I welcome this .
This legislation is an essential building block and foundation for the success of those measures still to come .
I therefore commend this important legislation to the House .
It is essential to ensure the safe and proper use of GMO products within the European Union .
I wish to do so again today , and it is meant as more than just lip service .
Mr Bowe has done a magnificent job and brought a very complicated procedure to a close .
We have brokered a good compromise .
The disputed antibiotic-resistant marker genes will be banned in Europe in the future .
Potential environmental dangers must be closely monitored .
The PPE-DE Group will be voting in favour of the Bowe report .
We have not clarified the question of exports of GMOs to non Member States .
I rather feel that we are buying a pig in a poke .
The BSE crisis should be a lesson and a reminder to us .
( The president cut the speaker off )
Clarification from the Council of Ministers and the Commission is needed on this matter .
There is now no demand for genetically modified food in the European Union .
More and more parts of the world are abandoning GM crops .
Recent scandals and problems involving food policy ought to have taught us to proceed carefully .
We want to retain the moratorium on commercial cultivation .
That is not something to which we can be a party .
Mr President , I compliment Mr Bowe on his work in this area .
Genetic modification of organisms constitutes interference with the characteristic properties of these organisms .
We need to reflect on the ethical implications of the new developments in this sector .
Consideration of the ethical issues surrounding human genetics demonstrates that biotechnology can have far-reaching consequences .
Clear boundaries are essential in this respect .
It is to be welcomed that the environmental aspects now fall within the scope of the directive .
It is also important that the antibiotic-resistant markers are to be eliminated in the fullness of time .
The Council should approve the Cartagena Protocol without delay .
It is important for exports to third countries to be carried out in a proper manner .
It is my hope that abuses and incorrect practices can be prevented through effective observance of the protocol .
Mr President , all in all , the joint text has my backing .
We largely have Mr Bowe to thank for this .
The rapporteur has done a fantastic job .
In this connection , I want to congratulate him on the report .
Let us just remember that genetic engineering provides humanity with new , unguessed at opportunities .
Just as always in the past , however , new knowledge also entails new risks and increased responsibility .
The debate is suspended .
The debate will be resumed this evening at 9 p.m.
Reform of the beef and veal market
I give the floor to Commissioner Fischler .
What exactly is this plan ?
In addition , our exports have , unfortunately , collapsed .
Fast action is called for .
Storing meat is clearly not enough per se .
We therefore also need fast reform .
Only a small part of the Agenda 2000 reform has really been implemented .
We need to take our time here if we are to avoid falling prey to hurried , political posturing .
The seven point plan will not take food out of the mouths of European farmers .
The Commission cannot , unfortunately , afford to make up the loss of income in full .
Our seven point plan should allow us to remove the detonator from this ticking time-bomb .
Allow me now to outline these seven points briefly .
These two measures should increase the incentive for extensive farming .
This measure will also act as an incentive to reduce intensive production .
We have no alternative .
The safety net has already been deployed in two Member States .
This week alone we shall probably put up to 30 000 tonnes of meat into storage .
And yet none of this is enough .
Thank you for your attention .
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his statement .
Mr President , Commissioner , it all sounds very hunky-dory , but a lot of it is cosmetic .
Would that not be a more reasonable course of action ?
Mr President , I would at least like to compliment the Commissioner on providing such a clear commentary .
I would mainly like to respond in my capacity as rapporteur for Budget 2001 .
My second question is does BSE have anything to do with the size of the farm ?
That seems to me to be in conflict with an effective programme for fighting BSE .
Mr President , my warmest congratulations to you , Commissioner Fischler .
These measures are a step in the right direction .
But this package sends out the right signal .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I promise to be much briefer .
As I , in fact , said .
Nor are we in a position to engage in agricultural reform at the moment .
I personally - and I say so quite openly - am against the guillotine .
I am against any instrument of murder and hence I am also against the guillotine .
I think you are quite right .
We have already looked into what Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf said about early marketing premiums .
We have calculated that this premium alone cost EUR 200 000 million .
Otherwise we shall not be able to keep the internal market together .
This system defies belief !
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , Commissioner , I have three brief questions .
I think that we need to tread somewhat carefully here .
Which is why I think we need to tread carefully .
Since these are national measures , national assistance rules apply .
And we are doing that , we have accepted that .
That is also a fact of life .
The first stage is in force and the second will follow on 1 January next year .
However , this second stage must already be complied with for any meat which enters storage .
Then there is also national certification .
Then there is also private certification .
With products involving government aid , certain rules must be respected .
However , they come within the remit of my colleague Commissioner Byrne .
Mr President , I have three short questions to ask Mr Fischler .
The systems vary from country to country in Europe .
What is the Commission ' s view on this ?
Is it necessary or not , or is it just a precautionary measure ?
The way in which the tests are funded varies from country to country .
Thirdly , we still import large quantities of beef from outside Europe .
Mr President , I should like to ask the Commissioner three questions .
Several options have been created here and a derogation should also be permitted in the future .
This plan must be notified to the Commission and will be evaluated by the Commission 's scientific committees .
If the committees consider the plan acceptable , it is automatically approved by the Commission .
This system has worked perfectly so far .
The Commission is currently working on the relevant proposals and my colleague Commissioner Byrne is working on this .
That is news to me .
The slaughter premiums are the same everywhere .
For the rest , we also made this suggestion in connection with Agenda 2000 .
It makes the position clear .
I am very grateful for that .
That creates a very acceptable basis for debate .
I have a question concerning the stocking density .
I cannot believe that Europe would be prepared to abandon them in their plight .
How are you planning to resolve this ?
So it is important to remove the older animals .
Can the Commission encourage the removal of those older animals ?
This investigation is under way .
So I cannot yet give a definitive reply on this .
That implies certain risks which we want to avoid at all costs .
That means that the alternative I have presented to you here can also be put into practice .
Thank you very much , Commissioner , for the answers you have given to all these questions .
That concludes the debate .
Question Time ( Commission )
The next item is Question Time ( B5-0007 / 2001 ) . We will examine questions to the Commission .
Mr Izquierdo Collado has the floor for a point of order .
Nor is it likely that I will ever be President of Parliament .
The President of the Commission does not usually attend this Question Time .
This is communicated to the Members of the European Parliament and they therefore ask specific questions .
That is the explanation I can give you , with complete transparency .
Mr Berenguer has the floor for a point of order .
I would ask him to be as concise as possible .
I do not want the Commission to reply to the ABC newspaper before replying to me .
Thank you very much , Mr Berenguer .
Question No 45 by ( H-0014 / 01 ) :
The report of that group will be ready in a few weeks ' time .
The World Health Organisation will also issue a report on the subject in the near future .
The Commission has no plans to initiate medical examination programmes .
I thank the Commissioner for his reply .
I am certain that the honourable Member recognises the nature of those limitations .
Question No 46 by ( H-0055 / 01 ) :
Does it intend to work towards this goal with the governments concerned ?
What preventative measures does it intend to take ?
The Commission understands public concern about the use of depleted uranium materials for military purposes .
Have I understood correctly ?
Is that what you meant ?
In all honesty , I can find no explanation for these statements , Mr President .
What can I say ?
Question No 47 by ( H-0037 / 01 ) :
What is the Commission 's response to Yugoslavia 's refusal to release the Albanian prisoners ?
The European Union has already repeatedly called for the release of all Albanian Kosovar prisoners .
As of today , the prisoners have still , regrettably , not been released .
The EU will keep up the pressure to ensure that they are .
There is a great deal of scepticism on the part of the Albanian Kosovars towards the Kostuníca regime .
The people are getting rather desperate .
There have been hunger strikes .
The people now want to see real progress .
I would like to know what the Commission intends to do about this .
Question No 48 by ( H-0069 / 01 ) :
They are now in danger of being tried and sentenced to lengthy prison terms .
Children and young people aged between 9 and 16 were arrested and taken to a prison in Diyarbakir .
The Commission has made representations to the Turkish authorities on this matter in the strongest terms .
The Commission has called for an immediate and full explanation of the facts .
This incident is a matter of grave concern to us .
This kind of behaviour is totally irreconcilable with the human rights standards prevailing in the European Union .
The Commission expects the Turkish Government to address this matter immediately .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
Your reply was most satisfactory .
I congratulate the Commissioner on his reply . However , he talks about EU values and standards .
Question No 49 by ( H-0085 / 01 ) :
Questions to Commissioner Kinnock
I would thank the Commissioner for his answer .
I have a number of questions .
The more I read about this procedure , the more it sets me thinking .
Issues such as this are always kept under review .
They are a plastic , but they are not really designated as one or the other .
Is he confident now that these substances are actually safe for children ?
However , the risk would depend on the characteristics of the non-food product itself .
The competent services of the Commission are currently working on possible improvements .
As they deal with the same subject , Questions Nos 50 , 51 and 52 will be taken together .
Question No 50 by ( H-0057 / 01 ) :
Question No 51 by ( H-0081 / 01 ) :
In the interview , Anita Gradin stated that she stood by the decisions taken in the Commission .
Question No 52 by ( H-0122 / 01 ) :
That was the sole purpose of the letter .
I am sure that will continue .
Well , that really takes the biscuit !
If Mr Kinnock had learned anything from the Commission to which he then belonged , he would have understood .
I would ask Members to take account of the fact that they are allowed to ask supplementary questions .
She was completely loyal to the decisions taken in the Commission .
How could you believe that former Commissioner Gradin had directed criticism against individuals ?
You must obviously have thought she had done so , because you wrote the letter .
Thank you for your answer .
Mr Kinnock refers to the letter to Mrs Gradin and Mr Asp .
My question , therefore , is as follows : what legal basis is there for this letter ?
What I said was not ridiculous .
It is not in any way a secret .
Mrs Steneberg is refusing to cooperate with the Swedish police and to travel to Stockholm for questioning .
This question has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the question on the order paper .
I will , however , respond to it in the interests of transparency .
That will take place in due course .
Question No 53 by ( H-0083 / 01 ) :
The selection board consisted of 8 men .
The Commission is very conscious of the need to increase the proportion of women in A1 and A2 grades .
The Commission will adopt the annual target for 2001 next month .
Thank you , Commissioner .
I can only draw the conclusion that the male candidate was appointed on a quota basis .
These are standards which I , and my colleagues in the current Commission , sincerely want to meet .
The position in the Council , if anything , is not even as good as that .
I believe we will reach the targets by 2005 .
They are not over-ambitious targets .
They are however realistic given our starting point .
I take the point that the honourable Member made about the single-sex nature of the selection board .
No preference on gender grounds was shown towards a man .
I hope that this support and understanding will continue .
The same applies to trying to secure a much improved gender balance .
Questions to Commissioner Byrne
Question No 54 by ( H-0011 / 01 ) :
What monitoring facilities have been set up ?
How many animals have accumulated in the individual countries ?
The information was provided in response to a questionnaire sent to Member States on 5 January 2001 .
Member States are responsible for the implementation of these measures .
Thank you for your answer , Commissioner .
Only a very short time has , of course , elapsed .
Question No 55 by ( H-0019 / 01 ) :
If the negotiations run their course as expected , the regulation on TSEs should be adopted next month .
The proposed regulation on animal by-products is expected to be voted on by Parliament shortly .
There have been statements from one minister saying one thing while another minister says the opposite .
At least in Germany ministers have resigned .
Will the Commission exercise a greater presence in our States in order to offer the citizens guarantees ?
In this instance I assume that when you are talking about these issues you are talking about beef .
These are obviously very powerful measures .
There has to be a pattern of behaviour by a Member State of ignoring the law .
What level of compliance can be demanded when we are talking about applying tests ?
What guarantees are being offered to consumers ?
Do you not think that this issue causes considerable alarm and insecurity among consumers ?
There are exceptions for some Member States , but what are they ?
And what is the reason for them ?
Where is the harmonisation ?
It is important to understand what we are talking about .
It is a Community-wide measure . It applies to all Member States .
This was a justifiable response .
There are many Member States which take the view that I went too far .
There are Member States that take the view that I did not go far enough .
Proportionate responses in these circumstances are what we tried to achieve .
Question No 56 by ( H-0021 / 01 ) :
Does the Commission believe that cattle bones present risks and have to be banned ?
Is their sale outlawed in any Member State ?
It is not acceptable that cheap meat should be less safe than dearer meat .
And this teacher is you , Commissioner .
Are there any future measures for which we should be preparing ourselves ?
I believe that all Member States now fully understand the importance of this .
Do you agree with this ?
Is this not a contradiction ?
Are you aware that what citizens are receiving is this contradictory and chaotic information ?
What do you say about the issue of the Guardia Civil ?
Answer me please .
It is a matter for the Member State to decide .
Some Member States do that .
That other measure can be allowed in those circumstances .
Mr Carnero González has the floor for a point of order .
The problem is then of exactly defining the criteria .
That concludes Questions to the Commission .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
Deliberate release of GMOs into the environment
The Bowe report has more than succeeded in achieving this result .
We are to have better monitoring , and we are to see time limits placed upon individual authorisations .
I do not think that the word " better " is enough .
We are not interested in buying a pig in a poke .
I therefore hope that we can obtain a statement on this issue today .
Comprehensive information promotes the consumer ' s freedom of choice .
The only way to do this is through labelling which is the very model of clarity .
The answer is , quite clearly , no , it will not .
We must not make the same mistake twice .
Only then will we be able to authorise the release of GMOs into the environment .
However , the time-scales are long and the problem is already there .
In short , biotechnology is bringing about a real revolution in science , economics and politics .
A revolution that brings hope but which also involves risks .
Mr President , we have already talked a great deal about genetic modification here in Parliament .
A vision that points the way and is broadly based .
That is precisely what Parliament has had such a struggle with .
The parliamentary majority swings back and forth between the position of NGOs and that of the business community .
I think that we , together with the rapporteur , can be proud of the negotiated outcome .
Our second task is to take decisions and to foster decision making .
We must put an end to all the legal uncertainty within the industry .
A tricky situation has arisen within the industry in recent years .
There is a de facto moratorium but no decision has ever been taken to this effect .
Consumers must have a choice and the Commission must provide guarantees to this effect .
Parliament ' s third task is to take responsibility .
The assessment must not be restricted to matters of safety alone .
Moreover , remember BSE .
Subsequently , human beings saddled the world with chemical waste dumps and dumping sites for radioactive waste .
If we had known then what we know now , I am sure we would have done things differently .
I have noted that the actual choice cannot be made on the basis of this document .
Yet , the right to information is not always acknowledged .
The proposed regulations must guarantee the reliable labelling and traceability of GMOs and derived products .
In addition , we must ensure that those who produce and release GMOs are held responsible .
We must denounce the lobbying by unscrupulous laboratories and the multinational companies who represent them .
It will also ensure that GMOs can be identified at all stages of the production chain .
These proposals will include processed food in the labelling systems .
This text already includes general legal obligations concerning traceability and labelling .
It will set the basic rules for an overall legislative framework in biotechnology .
There is one point of confusion which I wish to clear up .
Many speakers have spoken about the problem of a moratorium .
That is a decision that has to be taken between the Member States and the Commission .
What they do will decide what happens to the moratorium , not what we do tomorrow .
We know very well that this is just the first step in the process .
There is other legislation under way .
I can only say to the House that we must accept our responsibilities .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Community Eco-Management and Audit Scheme ( EMAS )
During these eight years of practical application we have learnt various lessons .
The first is its use as a market tool .
Despite this significant development , there is still potential for progress .
It would have been a disgrace if this principle had been dropped at third reading .
This will be good for the environment and beneficial to the credibility of the European institutions .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Mr President , I would ask permission to speak regarding the Rules of Procedure .
Does anyone wish to speak for the motion ?
Does anyone wish to speak against the motion to consider the report unacceptable ?
That is one of the reasons why I was appointed rapporteur .
I believe that there can be no question of our not voting on this directive .
We have heard one speech for the motion and one against .
If you vote against the motion , you consider it acceptable and we will therefore proceed to the debate .
( Parliament rejected the motion )
So we are not talking about enriched food , nor about food additives .
Vitamins and minerals are involved in many biochemical processes in the human body .
This directive on food supplements provides for the approximation of the laws of the Member States .
At the same time , we are establishing legal certainty for European consumers .
The Commission ' s proposal is therefore basically to be welcomed .
I particularly wish to highlight the area of application .
The Commission 's proposal for a directive adopts a rather narrow approach as regards the substances it covers .
This applies firstly to permitted minerals and their compounds .
These minerals should be accepted as a matter of principle .
Of course chemical compounds still need to be submitted to scientific tests .
Surely none of this can be the objective of this directive on food supplements .
The Commission proposal clearly covers this .
I totally support this .
Products are required to meet the highest purity and quality standards .
A compulsory notification procedure is essential in order to guarantee minimum levels of official control .
Above all , notification is only meaningful if a uniform procedure applies to all Member States .
Many thanks , Mrs Corbey .
Mr President , we are discussing a very important directive today .
The market for food supplements is developing apace .
This has to do with people ' s lifestyles and eating habits .
It also has to do with consumers ' insecurity about their own health .
People ' s health is a matter of the utmost concern .
We must therefore separate the wheat from the chaff .
The consumer is entitled to safe products and sound information .
There are major industrial interests at stake when it comes to food supplements .
There is no internal market but there are numerous rules at national level .
That is why the Commission 's proposal is so important .
I am pleased to compliment Mrs Müller on her consistent , professional and serious approach .
On behalf of the PSE Group , I would like to broach three subjects .
That is understandable but it fails to take into account how the industry has grown .
Herbal extracts , amino acids , and essential fatty acids are used in food supplements too .
The second point I would like to address is the need for scientific testing .
The maximum permitted quantities are determined according to the basic principles laid down in Article 5 .
That is the basis for consumer confidence .
Naturally , any country may decide for itself whether or not to permit untested ingredients .
The directive does not detract from this in any way .
Scientific research and approval are required for that to happen .
Lastly , a few words about labelling .
A good diet is crucial and is an aid to good health .
All in all , I think it is a marvellous proposal .
Once again , my sincere thanks to the rapporteur .
We support this report wholeheartedly , subject to guarantees that ingredients are scientifically tested .
The wish to be and to stay healthy is probably the most widely shared one .
We welcome this contribution .
We should not create a legal void in Europe with regard to ingredients which have physiological functions .
There are millions of consumers who would find that incomprehensible .
The definition of a food supplement in the directive should reflect all supplements .
Claim and counter-claim , then .
Ole Krarup also sowed the seeds of doubt about the legal basis .
I compliment the rapporteur on her report and all the work she has put in .
Food supplements can be a tonic or a health aid .
Our belief is that the two systems can coexist .
It allows the RDA to be taken into account when it is close to the upper safety limit .
I believe that the positive list , as it stands , is far too limited .
We should at the very least expand it by the amendments to this effect .
Labelling must allow for accurate health messages , such as for folic acid .
Folic acid is an example .
These are not just my views and those of my delegation .
That will help many consumers and worry none .
There are vitamins which if naturally produced are more effective then when they are synthetically produced .
I would like to pick up one last point relating to what Mrs Sandbæk said .
The Commission should not be attempting to make it .
We would be better off without it .
Consumers must have access to clear instructions on the dosage and use of the product .
In this respect I welcome the fact that we are 16 against 15 .
I took some persuading that a directive such as this was necessary at all .
Basically we must be driven by informed consumer choice and safety .
We must assume that the intelligence quotient of the average European citizen is reasonable .
We must desist from getting into the ' nanny state ' frame of mind .
When we get up in the morning can we go to bed at night ?
Please do not take me seriously but I really am frustrated with the way we are headed .
Points made in relation to the physiological effects must be reinstated .
I appeal through the President to my colleague to look at this again .
I am quite upset at the way the oral amendment was bounced .
I do not want my life regulated to that extent .
It brings the Commission and the European project into disrepute with citizens who are otherwise not Eurosceptic at all .
I appeal to you to get the balance right .
It is most important .
Ladies and gentlemen , the internal market does not work .
Harmonisation is therefore necessary .
Commissioner , this is not harmonisation .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Two or three-wheel motor vehicles
We cannot therefore make an exception for motorcycles and scooters .
I do not agree with that .
However , these categories are regularly confronted with more stringent emission standards .
Therefore , I personally am content with the line proposed by the rapporteur .
Mr President , all in all I am delighted with Mr Lange ' s report .
Motorcycles constitute a very small percentage of traffic volume .
I therefore welcome this proposal but with certain reservations .
This would put European manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage as compared with the big boys from the Far East .
I have some reservations regarding on-board diagnostics and in-service testing .
I suspect he may be tempted just to take the bulb out .
Lastly , on the subject of fiscal measures .
Subsidiarity is something that should be protected .
Finally , I have a question for the Commission .
Trains too , must , and could , be far cleaner .
I hope the Commission is prepared to respond on this point .
These values really look quite respectable .
The rapporteur , however , is suggesting a second stage for mandatory limit values to apply from 2006 .
This stage would be based on a test cycle for passenger cars .
The Commission acknowledges the need for this second stage .
We shall be putting forward a separate proposal for this by the end of 2002 .
In this next stage , emissions will have to be measured in relation to an improved test cycle .
The situation will thus be made to match the real driving dynamics of motorcycles .
The work programme is progressing according to schedule .
This is in line with Mr Lange ' s views .
The relevant amendments are Amendments Nos 3 , 5 , 10 , 11 , 23 , 24 and 25 .
A motorcycle , however , is a very different product from a car in technical terms .
This is a reference to Amendments Nos 6 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 20 and 22 .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Vehicles with more than eight seats
All of these organisations are happy with the common position and the amendments .
In fact , they welcome the clarification it brings to the market .
I have listened to the users carefully and I have consulted widely .
These amendments have to be taken in conjunction with Amendment No 7 .
Amendment No 4 sets out in more detail the user groups that this report is trying to assist .
This list is , however , neither exhaustive nor prescriptive .
It was never intended to be and leaves plenty of scope for the inclusion of others .
For the first time , we are making public transport accessible to all those people with reduced mobility .
Maybe I should declare an interest at this point .
Just before Christmas my mother unexpectedly lost her sight .
We have that chance tomorrow by voting for those amendments .
I must , however , also mention Amendment No 9 which was submitted later by the PPE-DE Group .
I would be ashamed if their Amendment No 9 is carried .
So I will not go through the amendments .
He has done a good job on that .
It relates to the whole issue of whether Parliament should be handling technical directives .
The same arguments apply .
I want to pick up on a point made by Bill Miller .
Regrettably that is not the case .
If it were , we would support it .
What have we actually achieved after nine years ?
Do we really have mutual recognition of technical standards between countries ?
Have we really achieved the sort of significant advances in safety that we want ?
If we really had achieved that , then we should be proud of it .
There are going to be new provisions for superstructures .
When is all this going to end ?
Not a single word of explanation .
That is why my group will be recommending that this is rejected tomorrow .
Do they do so on grounds of cost ?
Do they do so because of objections from manufacturers ?
Do they do so because of a genuine difficulty at all ? No .
They are wrong .
We must and we will .
We are fully in agreement with that .
So why are we rejecting this directive ?
The directive also contains a formula that must even be hard for engineers to understand .
I have to say that this document is not a suitable basis for political decision making .
This is extremely important and needs to be guaranteed .
Secondly , we want safety standards for drivers and passengers .
Thirdly , we want the principle of mutual recognition .
We wish to see mutual recognition .
However , the Council ' s common position rides roughshod over Parliament .
The report is about more than just buses .
It is about the way in which the EU is to legislate .
What I am opposed to is the mode of procedure .
People quite rightly question an EU that is in many ways unwieldy and bent on regulating .
An example is Annex V of the Council ' s common position .
I do not want to contribute to making ourselves and the EU into laughing-stocks .
Why should Parliament change its mind now ?
For the Swedish Conservative Party , this was an important issue in the 1999 elections .
I was elected on a mandate to combat politicians ' inability to leave things alone .
I cannot therefore vote in favour of the Council ' s common position .
This draft has been before us for three years already .
We have come a long way since then .
A consensus has been reached between the Council , Parliament and Commission .
Amendments Nos 1 , 7 and 8 are acceptable as they stand .
I want to reply to Mr Harbour on this question of principle .
For instance , we are talking about disabilities at the moment .
We must see what type of regulatory reforms we can have which serve this purpose in an easier way .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Community incentive measures in employment
Open coordination means that countries may use different methods of achieving common goals .
What we have here are recommended guidelines for the policies of the Member States .
The process is open .
Is the process too informal , then ?
Is there anything we can learn from the efforts of other countries ?
Article 129 provides , of course , for the possibility of introducing pilot projects .
We want an exchange of information about the ways and means of involvement at local level .
This could be a pilot project .
We have done this precisely to promote a broader knowledge of European employment strategy .
To put it briefly , the open coordination method must be open in two senses .
The Commission has also applied its funding very carefully .
Expenditure was only 50 % of commitments .
The potential is certainly there .
First of all , I want to congratulate the rapporteur .
That is gratifying , for this is a very important piece of work .
These amendments relate to five different points .
First of all , information must be provided about employment policy .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am speaking on behalf of the Italian radicals .
Mr President , I really do not think we need this .
One of the Union ' s objectives is to promote a high level of employment .
I wish to say a final word about the allocation of resources for employment incentive measures .
The use of public funds must be dealt with in a balanced and extremely rigorous way .
This is a very good report .
Some of the amendments that have come through have not made it a better document .
I refer to just two aspects .
I strongly support women 's rights .
But only the women have their own committee to speak up for them .
At times , perhaps , their voice drowns out some of the other groups , in my judgment .
Apparently " maximum possible " is not quite maximum enough .
I believe it was fine as it was .
I have my tomato-proof suit on just in case you were thinking of doing something .
The second point concerns the budget .
Last year 's budget was EUR 50 million .
Only two-thirds of that was spent ; 25 % of that was eaten up by administrative costs .
It is a reflection of the enthusiasm of the committee for this particular project .
I fear I may have to wait a long time to see that .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
( The sitting was closed at 12.20 a.m. )
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Yesterday ' s Minutes have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Firstly , nuclear weapons are not only immoral and inhumane , they are also illegal .
My action on Monday was therefore upholding the law , not breaking it .
It is our responsibility to use them .
A democratic state is not just a gift and right , it is a responsibility .
My action on Monday was one further small step in trying to achieve that .
I have never once called for parliamentary immunity .
I had my day in court and I had my trial .
Mr President , can I just establish for yesterday 's Minutes a correction to my vote .
I intended to vote yes on the Rübig Report .
Mr President , my point also relates to the Minutes .
We will look into this matter .
If you are right , the Minutes will , of course , be corrected , as you say .
( The Minutes were approved )
Thank you , Mr Carnero González . I believe that the House would join you in hoping this .
Accession partnership with Turkey
Turkey will then have to act .
Turkey is neither privileged nor disadvantaged .
But it is up to Turkey to take the domestic policy decisions .
And that is the essence of my report as well .
We hope that Turkey will make substantial progress in the coming years .
Some people harbour the illusion that negotiations could begin in one or two years ' time .
I don 't want to discourage or disappoint anyone , but it will take several years .
For we are Turkey 's partners anyway , and we must be good partners .
And indeed , we should not deny this .
It is a difficult issue .
Let me conclude with two further brief comments .
But I am also opposed to the exploitation of this issue for nationalist purposes in Turkey .
A more relaxed and , above all , a more active role in the Armenia issue would be helpful .
This distinction has been drawn on sensible political grounds .
I do not think that such a step constitutes equal treatment in the real sense .
In other words , we are talking about those countries that have fulfilled the Copenhagen criteria , for example .
I have a feeling this would have a demoralising effect .
I would specifically like to know from the Commission to what extent this would actually have financial implications .
How would Amendment No 1 actually affect the other candidate countries ?
What exactly is the situation ?
If that were so , I would find it most strange .
I think that technically speaking , it would be extremely difficult to effect this budgetary change .
That does not seem to us to be fair , and so we should rethink the situation .
If we want to do something for Turkey then there is always the Customs Union .
We must bring these matters to a sound conclusion . I could not agree more .
It is a large country and it is very different from the other candidate countries .
This difference provokes certain general comments .
In this particular case , the European Union is also sitting exams , in numerous subjects .
Obviously that will not suffice .
Leyla Zana , the European Parliament Sakharov prizewinner , is still in jail .
We expect to see Turkey move forward ; instead all we see is it moving backwards .
Here Turkey 's conduct shows a regressive trend .
The door remained closed .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Swoboda for his speech and also the report .
The regulation is a confidence-building measure .
The regulation will trigger a raft of reforms .
We in the Liberal Group will assess this national programme for reform critically but fairly .
My own group is still facing the same dilemma on that level .
The question now is does this strategy work ?
Let me cite the prisoners ' riot by way of example .
Can we compel , or perhaps entice them to pay this price ?
It is the European Union ' s responsibility to ask this question and have a crack at it .
I think they would enhance the regulation .
The situation has certainly not improved in recent weeks and months .
But I do not want to go into that here .
What would be the result of this Austrian footballing analogy , I wonder ?
This brings me to the real issue which I would like to raise .
I would claim that the reality is very different .
Can the reasons for our cautiousness have disappeared or become less pressing ?
What about the Kurdish question , which is making no progress ?
And what of the military ' s influence over the regime which is still powerful ?
Have all these issues changed or become significantly less serious ?
We do not think so .
We even think that we are not alone in holding this opinion .
Let us see what the Commission ' s latest report on the Turkish situation has to say .
Turkey ' s economic importance for the European Union today is considerable .
Parliament wants to be involved in this evaluation process , which is all well and good .
At any rate , it was a step too far for our taste .
After all , the political and cultural divide between the two parties is far too wide .
Ongoing tensions bear this out .
Two elements of the proposed Accession Partnership have reinforced this decision .
Secondly , Article 4 of the Commission proposal .
Yet it is still being given the chance to join the EU .
But the question is under what conditions and with what financial resources .
But we should not reproach him for doing so , for everyone has the right to alter their opinion .
Let us look forward rather than constantly harking back .
Here today , we have made it clear that this accusation is untrue .
And here today , our colleagues from the Turkish Parliament are listening to us and following the debate .
We are politicians , and we rightly ask about the politicians .
I think this is our problem .
There are still a great many obstacles to be overcome along the way .
There is nothing unusual at all in the fact that Europe is helping Turkey on its way .
But reading between the lines , it does highlight a very important message , namely Turkey belongs in Europe .
The ELDR Group wholeheartedly supports this fundamental message .
We repudiate that kind of intolerance .
Article 4 of the proposal dealt with by Mr Swoboda should be implemented immediately .
We do not need to go any further .
This must be stopped right now .
Otherwise , is this the right way to guarantee the promotion of Kurdish identity ?
As Mr Brie has pointed out , reality contradicts us .
There are many of us wondering , especially millions of Coptic Christians in Egypt .
I would like to discuss a practical case in Turkey .
For these statements he risks several years of imprisonment .
We in the Christian Democratic parliamentary Group PPE-DE are following the case .
The regulation under discussion concerns pre-accession aid to Turkey .
Turkey was accepted as a candidate country at the Helsinki Summit .
For this reason , it would be appropriate if we treated it as we do the other candidate countries .
The EU Financial Perspective includes a Heading 7 covering pre-accession aid .
Every year around three billion euros are set aside there - rather more than that , in fact .
These countries are therefore actually accorded a different status from the other candidate countries .
Heading 7 , " Pre-accession Aid " , has not been used correctly .
However , Heading 4 , " External Action " has become over-burdened .
Parliament has thus borne a greater responsibility for EU foreign policy than the Council .
This position is wrong for three reasons .
The second reason is because we should not discriminate .
However , to be perfectly honest , I am beginning to wonder if Turkey wants the same thing .
This amendment is totally unacceptable and I will tell you just two reasons why .
The first reason is that the budget for these programmes has already been decided .
May I remind the House that Turkey also benefits from the MEDA programme .
Mr President , I have a dream .
The Swoboda report is one outcome of the Helsinki decision and is therefore important .
This would have two consequences .
Both are highly unlikely scenarios .
On the other budgetary aspects , I go along with the Swoboda report .
I also think it is important that there should be no discrimination against Turkey .
And of course this does not apply to Turkey .
Mr President , I will continue where my colleague Mr Stenzel left off .
I say this without any ifs and buts .
So this is a fresh start which has our full support .
The regulation includes an Article 4 which allows funding to be suspended under certain circumstances .
So I would also ask our colleagues on the rostrum to help dispel this misconception at last .
Accession will only take place on our terms .
Unfortunately , nothing has changed in that regard .
There is no point glossing over this fact or remaining silent about what is actually happening .
This brings me to my second point .
In Helsinki we said , yes , we should give it a go .
It simply has not .
That is why one cannot say either that it has not had any results .
The Accession Partnership sets out our expectations of Turkey .
This document will be the most important document in the history of Euro-Turkish relations over the past few decades .
That is why I underline what a number of speakers have already said .
Turkey is an important country .
Turkey is of particular strategic importance .
That can and must not happen .
Turkey will not become a member until it has fulfilled these accession conditions to the letter .
That is why I believe that we have made enormous strides .
The Commission would like this to happen too .
They do not want us to change the Heading , but more money .
They have all been paid out .
Only SAPARD was paid out rather late .
But we do not have any budgetary reserves there .
That is , in fact , the political basis for the situation we have today .
In this connection we can very clearly discern in Turkey a massive movement in the year 2000 .
It will be measured in real structural changes and in real changes to people ' s living conditions .
I am pleased to have discovered such a broad consensus regarding this matter in this Parliament .
Our steadfastness in this matter will help us to reach our goals .
Mr Sacrédeus also takes up the important issue of the trial of a Turkish priest .
The Council is monitoring this matter extremely carefully .
We know that the next trial hearing is on 22 February .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
The next item is the joint debate on :
The summit placed its bets on the best Europe has to offer .
It stated that we are on the road towards full employment .
This is the strongest productive force that Europe can release .
They must not be played off against each other .
For many of us this is a challenge to our way of thinking .
The Stockholm Summit comes precisely at this decisive moment .
We are told that concrete objectives are difficult to set .
Take a complex issue like interest rate trends or the dismantling of excessive national debt .
Whoever wants to must move forward courageously and overcome the rivalries between the European institutions .
The people of Europe do not understand the petty jealousies over the allocation of competences .
And Mr Bullmann has stressed this point too .
In Nice we defined 35 structural indicators , which are the ones the synthesis report is based upon .
They are also a reference for the progress we can make in the next few years .
In other cases things are moving too slowly .
We must not just think exclusively about growth and forget about the other aspects of Lisbon .
The second of my concerns is that we have to strengthen the potential growth of the Union .
All these objectives are highly demanding .
I believe there are basically three of these factors .
Mr Solbes has mentioned them : energy , transport and telecommunications .
Lastly , education .
This is the third fundamental recommendation in this analysis and stock-taking of the Lisbon European Council .
Full employment must constitute a fundamental aim for EU economic and social policy .
The strategy adopted in Lisbon is an important milestone in the development of the EU .
We hope that the Council will be able to decide on this in Stockholm .
Nor do we need any new processes .
Instead , the Stockholm European Council should highlight certain prioritised areas .
This also requires a commercial climate which facilitates investment and the establishment of new growth companies .
I want us in Stockholm to highlight the directions for further progress in these areas .
Let me name a few .
Furthermore , we need to continue work on opening up the transport markets .
However , we must also take into account the moral and ethical dimension of biotechnology .
Expected demographic development in Europe poses a growing challenge .
Demographic development must be tackled on a broad political front right now .
It will also require measures to increase participation in the labour market .
This is in the interests of us all .
Mr President , I do not know how convincing I can be in just four minutes .
Other Members have effectively summed up the most significant results of the Lisbon Summit already .
We need more educated , suitably trained workers in all leading-edge sectors .
The whole of our society , our economic life , is on the threshold of major structural changes .
What we have become used to is disappearing ; things are changing .
A policy to establish a regulatory framework is now more pressing than ever .
To this end , a number of conditions need to be met and we need to do our homework .
The policy on training has already been addressed on a number of occasions .
The resource Europe has is knowledge .
This is where we must invest in our young people , in particular .
We talk about new technologies such as the Internet .
But we also need to talk about equipping people with new ways of thinking .
But we also need to talk about flexibility in our labour markets .
We are all in agreement on the objective of making labour more flexible .
We also need to make more effort in the area of high technology .
The Internet has been mentioned .
Access to the Internet in Europe is still too expensive .
Its use in comparison with other countries is still too limited .
But we should not restrict our investments to new technologies .
I am fundamentally opposed to this demarcation .
In Bavaria there is a carpenter who already achieves 70 % of his sales via the Internet .
I think he simply belongs to the economy .
We need to bring them together and make them viable .
An example is water .
Water is a limited resource .
We can make them more effective and structure them positively .
But we must not abandon political responsibility .
It is a difficult balancing act .
We will raise this issue again later in the year in the liberalisation debates in this House .
But I think it must be possible to combine competition , subsidiarity and political answerability on the ground .
This has come about via Amsterdam and Lisbon and is now continuing in Stockholm .
Yes , to a large extent they are local , regional and national issues .
So let us focus on certain important issues so as to set the process in motion .
I would also like to emphasise the role of Parliament .
This is the right ambition to have and must now be followed up effectively in Stockholm .
We now need firm proposals .
The 14 million unemployed have had enough of grand resolutions .
We would have preferred a more concentrated approach and a clear list of priorities .
In this context the Council deserves the most criticism , but Parliament is also at fault .
Biotechnology must also be stimulated .
Do not forget that .
More and more people are wondering when Sweden will fulfil its commitments .
It is what is called constructive criticism .
My second point is that the Commission quite rightly talks of an integrated response .
I would like to make some suggestions regarding three broad areas to make this integration operate more smoothly .
We must ensure that the Gothenburg report rearranges the order of Lisbon ' s priorities .
Parliament is currently considering this issue .
Initiatives must be taken to limit the extent to which competition is introduced into various sectors .
Secondly , there is the role of education and training .
You start off by making a fundamental observation about the general lack of training .
The Commission should look into two issues more closely .
On the one hand , the issue of balancing work , training and leisure time .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , what is the path to be followed after Lisbon ?
I would like to give my response in terms of the content , our responsibilities and the method .
However , it still contains many areas of bias .
These areas of bias are obvious in the current problem regarding indicators .
Why is Ireland being criticised ?
Mr Goebbels and Mr Bullmann have , moreover , tabled a good amendment to enable us to do this .
Secondly , the European Parliament should be able to make straightforward choices .
In my opinion , the two reports , for which the committees voted unanimously , contradict one another .
I support the Bullmann report , which recommends public investment and social legislation .
Yet , people are not familiar with these methods of coordination .
They have absolutely no idea what they entail .
We should , therefore , give thought to our responsibilities .
In Europe , we are irresponsibly consuming the national insurance contributions of young people .
The business community is already complaining of fact-finding overload .
The national statistical offices simply do not have the resources or manpower for the job .
And to saddle Eurostat with it would be putting the cart before the horse .
The 27 indicators proposed by the Commission is on the excessive side as it is .
In any case , statistics do not tell the whole story .
They provide a snapshot of reality .
And of course Belgium has long been renowned for its skating prowess .
In short , indicators are a means of steering policy but not an end in themselves .
Of course , the truth lies in coming up with an intelligent combination of the two approaches .
This in fact gives rise to the problem of increased burdens on medium-sized enterprises .
It is therefore about fostering competition between systems , and private involvement .
At the same time we also need rules to make sure that our systems are competitive .
Many in our group fear that the report before us contains too much detailed knowledge and detailed analyses .
We must take this problem into consideration .
We need more global rules for global competition .
Unemployment has finally fallen , even though the still high level of unemployment is deplorable .
But it must be consolidated and implemented .
The US economic climate , however , is keeping Europe on tenterhooks .
But a soft landing does seem possible .
Nevertheless , Europe must be prepared for lower demand for its exports .
This is also true for information and communications technologies and for the labour markets .
To this end , the instruments of privatisation and deregulation must be exploited to the full .
This is in the interest of the European model of a social market economy .
It is also important that the open coordination process method is taken a step further .
The Swedish Presidency has called for democracy and transparency in this area .
I hope they are as good as their word .
We then table amendments when we do not know what the effect of those amendments will be .
They are ready to renationalize .
California is turning dramatically left .
New Zealand ' s experiment in market fundamentalism has failed " .
With this in mind , I wonder what the Swedish Presidency intends to do now .
The Swedish Presidency was in fact recently praised by The Economist for the egalitarian traditions in Sweden .
Are you now going to continue down the EU ' s incorrect road towards deregulation fundamentalism ?
It would be interesting to receive an answer on this .
Has this belt-tightening policy been abolished on the basis of the Lisbon decisions ?
No , clearly not .
The provision for the current year is for a growth of around 8 % .
We are one of the few Member States making massive provisions for future pensions .
And yes , Mr President and Commissioner , our inflation is falling .
I did not hear that mentioned recently .
But according to the Commission there can be no question of them reaping the benefits .
Are we to be the victims of our own success ?
We are on the right path .
I found what Mr Prodi said yesterday very encouraging .
But the question is this : who is responsible for this economic policy ?
Or are the responsibilities different ?
They are the areas which fall to the European Union .
Where do I think these priorities lie ?
In which areas will we need more information before long ?
We need more up-to-date information for example on the development of GDP and its components .
We need more data on the growth of services in the European Union .
I shall give the floor to Mr Rack for a procedural motion .
. ( DE ) Madam President , over the last few days you have worked miracles time and again .
For instance , you managed to get Air France to bring Members to the Chamber on time .
Perhaps you could work yet another miracle .
All these further amendments are unacceptable to the Commission .
Thank you , Commissioner Solbes , and I shall give the floor to Mr Cashman for a procedural motion .
Thank you , Mr Cashman , for sharing this information .
I think that many in this Chamber are affected , as authors .
But as far as Amendment No 33 is concerned , I am particularly biased .
I will definitely not be voting on Amendment No 33 .
Thank you too , Mrs Echerer , for your honesty .
I refer to Article 1 of Annex I of our Rules of Procedure .
The Rules do not require us to register such an interest before voting .
Otherwise , we can continue ; I have a long list of Members who have requested the floor .
I only hope that there will be some Members left to vote .
I shall be abstaining .
I will be abstaining .
Madam President , I am actually in the same situation .
We can now , therefore , proceed to the vote .
Before the vote on Amendment No 11
The background to this is quite simple , in December 1996 the WIPO Agreement was concluded .
We want to ensure it only covers archive productions which were produced before December 1996 .
Mr Lehne , in your speech , you made it very clear that you are proposing an oral amendment .
Nevertheless , we shall conduct the test , pursuant to the Rules of Procedure .
After the vote on Amendment No 32
This is not the same , so I request correction in all language versions .
Ideally , this point should have been made before the vote .
I think that you are absolutely right in stating that this must be investigated properly before voting .
Before the vote on Amendment No 38
Madam President , the Dutch version of Amendment No 38 has not been correctly worded .
Indeed , Mr De Clercq , we shall do that if the amendments are adopted .
Before the vote on Amendment No 35
Madam President , I would just like to say that here too the German version is incorrect .
( The President declared the common position approved as amended ) President .
The amendment that the Commission cannot accept is No 9 .
Then there were 90 pages ; today there are 150 .
I call on my colleagues to vote against it .
( Applause from the right )
( The President declared the common position approved as amended )
However , a series of other measures may be adopted .
Mr Krarup , on behalf of his group , has just moved a request for referral back to committee .
In accordance with the Rules of Procedure , I shall put this to the House .
Is there a speaker in favour of this request ?
Mrs Müller , the rapporteur , has spoken against the referral back to committee .
Is there a speaker in favour of the request ?
Madam President , I am sorry .
The Court of Justice will agree with us at all times .
I shall ask Mr Swoboda .
I believe that this amendment is admissible .
Madam President , I do not discern any discriminatory content .
It was accepted almost unanimously in committee , in the presence of Baroness Nicholson in fact .
That is what I think as well . However , thank you , Mr Swoboda , for your comments .
Madam President , my apologies .
Amendment No 9 is discriminatory , in my view , on grounds of religion .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
I believe that there is a great deal to be gained on both sides with this agreement .
The agreement is to receive EUR 8.6 million for its five-year duration .
Bowe report ( A5-0032 / 2001 )
That is what today ' s vote means .
To vote in favour of the directive would be like buying a pig in a poke .
The requirement concerning the termination of unauthorised releases also clarifies the need for a consistent response .
I have therefore abstained in the vote .
The needs of our environment and biodiversity should be paramount in this area .
I do not believe that is the currently the position of Council .
Consumers must be able to choose whether or not to buy GMO products .
We believe it is important to establish clear rules in this area .
However , there are still some disturbing grey areas .
In other words , in this matter , there will be no requirement to give honest and open information .
There is no doubt that the European authorities are repeat offenders .
We therefore voted against this report .
The Commission has made known its intention to table draft directives - but when will these be approved ?
What provisions will they lay down ?
We cannot vote on the release of GMOs without these guarantees .
This draft directive constitutes more of a threat because of what it omits rather than what it contains .
This then really is a fool ' s bargain .
My party , the Socialist Party in the Netherlands , thinks that is no kind of solution .
Hence I will vote against the proposal .
García-Orcoyen Tormo report ( A5-0033 / 2001 )
The eco-management and audit scheme will be an incentive .
I have voted against because I am opposed to the word ' voluntary ' which appears in the title .
Who is responsible for assessing how environmentally-friendly companies are ?
The report produced by the Conciliation Committee deems the outcome of the conciliation procedure highly satisfactory .
This relates to the compromise , in which amendments were adopted and withdrawn .
I note that this aspiration was not given due attention during the conciliation procedure .
This would appear to put the ball back in the court of the two Member States concerned .
Recommendation for second reading ( A5-0043 / 2001 ) by Mr Boselli
Madam President , I voted in favour of the report on protecting copyright .
Before coming into the House I met a young man , Marcello , from Pescara .
I am not making this up , it is true !
Obviously he finds them interesting and worth exhibiting .
I hope so .
If so , I will be even happier that I voted in favour of the motion .
I believe that it provides Parliament and the Council with a good starting point for resolving this difficult problem .
The computer games industry in my own region represents a third of the computer games world market .
The music industry would crumble without proper protection from piracy on the Internet .
However , the libraries have accepted that the rights of authors are a priority .
That is why we support their calls to defend copyright .
. I declare an interest in the matter of copyright .
I am not a paid lobbyist .
It should not , however , lead to daylight robbery .
Despite today ' s vote , the battle is still far from being won .
These aspects must be borne in mind even when the new technologies are used .
Why was there was so much lobbying ?
Regarding Amendment No 2 , I believe that double payment must be avoided .
That is why it is difficult to reconcile the divergent interests of consumers , industries and rightholders .
For authors and composers , this compromise weakens copyright protection .
Authors are quite rightly demanding fair compensation for the losses they will incur because of the exceptions .
Exceptions to protection would , in fact , be subject to expropriations for which there should be compensation .
For artists , the work they produce is their income .
Society exempts them from doing other types of work by paying them for their products .
If they lose this money they will have to look for alternative work .
Consumers , on the other hand , would prefer to get hold of these products for free .
Recommendation for second reading ( A5-0039 / 2001 ) by Mr Miller
Madam President , I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in the name of my group .
This is a long-awaited directive and it is extremely important to disabled people .
It has taken nine years to get this far .
This is really important .
My group wishes to declare its solidarity with all those who will be assisted by this .
We can be proud of that and glad that this directive has been passed .
We in the PPE-DE Group still take this line .
I am concerned that people change tack so quickly in the second reading .
I also voted against Amendment No 9 calling for no debate on this document .
Subsidiarity should not be just a nice word ; it should be implemented .
. This Parliament can be proud today that it has voted to enhance disability rights .
In particular , this report is a victory for disabled transport users .
It has taken nine years to get this legislation .
The new technical standards we voted for will ensure that wheelchair access is available for public transport .
It is cynical political manipulation to play games with disability rights .
Therefore , we support the amendment aimed at rejecting the common position .
Müller report ( A5-0025 / 2001 )
So I think certain substances should be controlled .
Substances are added to foods to make them aphrodisiac . Substances like Viagra are on sale .
The pensioners of the party I represent have no need of these food additives and supplements .
So they are calling - and rightly so - for their regulation .
- ( SV ) We have voted against the report by Mrs Müller on food supplements .
But quality not quantity matters .
The annexed list has been drawn up for this purpose .
I am firmly convinced that the public debate is only just beginning .
Obviously , they should not present a health risk .
However , we should refrain from working towards European legislation that is too restrictive .
We must also avoid drawing up a list of vitamins that is too restrictive .
Lange report ( A5-0015 / 2001 )
Pensioners appreciate silence , bicycles and quiet motorcycles .
Jensen report ( A5-0018 / 2001 )
EUR 55 million are to be spent and not a single job created .
I think the European Union should move on from words to deeds .
. I fully support proposals to encourage an employment strategy across the European Union .
We can only fight the scourge of unemployment if we work together right across the 15 Member States .
Jobs , jobs , jobs .
That is what it is all about .
That is what the Labour Government is campaigning for and that is what Europe is working for .
It is our top priority and we must move heaven and earth to make it happen .
In Britain , our Labour Government is leading the way towards job creation and full employment .
The aim is to create a flexible , high-skilled workforce in Britain .
But to expect this of the European institutions is to ask the impossible .
We therefore voted against this report .
More specifically , the following actions will be covered :
2 ) Assessment of national action plans ;
I also consider it essential to encourage the widest possible distribution of the results of any projects completed .
I would also argue in favour of our Mediterranean partners being involved .
I therefore abstained .
It was important to emphasise the need for a European strategy that would be accessible and transparent .
That is why the Union for a Europe of Nations Group has supported this report .
Swoboda Report ( A5-0024 / 2001 )
Their entry into the European Union will then be received with greater satisfaction .
If we want people to join us , they must be genuinely democratic , and Turkey is not .
Madam President , we remain concerned about Turkey .
It should also monitor fair distribution of the money .
Why then should we grant Turkey a financial status which is not appropriate to its real status ?
( The sitting was suspended at 1.21 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Action taken on EIB annual report
We have thus arrived at a report on which we are practically unanimous .
We must , however , stress that times are changing .
Europe is expanding eastwards .
In other words , this international agreement will become binding in 7 years ' time .
Finally , Europe has given priority to the development of SMEs .
These three points I refer to the decision of the House .
This is the first time that the European Parliament has delivered its opinion on the annual report .
Naturally this opinion is of a political nature and it casts a critical eye over the institution .
Next , the report draws attention to the EIB ' s internal scrutiny .
The EIB should also evaluate effectiveness and the return on investments more .
Both functions must be fulfilled .
This must be organised differently , for example by the Luxembourg Central Bank .
That is also one of the European Union ' s priorities .
That is why we support this report wholeheartedly .
So the fault does not lie with you .
Before I make a few comments as to content , I would just like to compliment the rapporteur too .
If the press report from last week is anything to go by , he has acquitted himself well .
I will talk about employment first .
Attention must also be given to adequate participation in the labour market .
These are very important matters that we must concern ourselves with in the months to come .
I have a final comment to make .
There has been more talk about dialogue , openness , environmental considerations and change .
Two thirds of its disbursements go towards this .
All the activities of the European Central Bank in this area are of special importance .
To begin with , the bank ' s operational priorities .
The initial reports were , of course , fairly critical .
I would add that we are amenable to any practicable form of banking supervision .
This is a matter that has been discussed by your committee .
We are completely open to any proposals in this connection .
But , subject to that reservation , we have decided to move towards greater transparency .
With that sole proviso , all projects will be announced on our website .
It was established to serve the objectives of the European Union .
It is therefore only natural that it should be called upon to explain itself before the European Parliament .
Thank you , Mr Maystadt , for the contribution that you and your bank make .
The President of the bank has already made some reference to the efforts made .
Allow me to comment on the greater importance to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises .
First , sharing out resources more efficiently .
Secondly , the idea of the bank ' s activities being more consistent with Community policies is also important .
I think all of this will end up benefiting the bank ' s activities and the policies defined .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon .
Lisbon ( continuation )
The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on :
the Commission report on progress since Lisbon and future measures , and
I would like to make two points .
How do we measure this success ?
That would help our debate a great deal .
There is nothing unifying in this ; it is simply divisive .
It is simply promoting the delegitimisation of holders of political office .
Why are we in Parliament no longer trusted ?
We need a new merger control and a new competition policy .
So they are not here but they will be joining us as soon as possible .
The Lisbon process requires a move from words to action .
One of 10 years will soon have passed .
It is no longer a matter of directions and timetables such as we heard about this morning .
What decisions will you produce in the next six months to achieve increased competitiveness in Europe ?
I believe that the Swedes have an excellent opportunity to show some leadership .
Both the Council and the Commission have today addressed demographic development in the EU .
Yesterday , I listened to State Secretary Ekström , who is responsible for the European Council in Stockholm .
She introduced important elements into the discussion on growth , including the significance of trade .
This is excellent , as it is vital for both growth and solidarity .
A good economy is a prerequisite for welfare .
Cohesion must not be restricted to the Structural Funds .
A stimulus that leads to regeneration and an increase in competitiveness and productivity .
Similarly , again in my own opinion , we should rethink how many of them there should be .
Universal service must be defined in relation to the new technological environment .
That is where the advantage of a universal service lies .
This progressive attitude cannot be reconciled with statements made in this report .
The rapporteur mentioned in passing this morning that there were European countries with models of interest .
Of course there are .
But why is this not highlighted ?
Mr President , I would like to make three points with regard to the Stockholm Summit .
We have now done just that , but on our own initiative .
Accordingly , the report that is before us is calling for an interinstitutional agreement to that effect .
My second point concerns social protection .
It has taken ten years finally to grant the topic political status .
This has now been done .
But this is , of course , a very apprehensive start .
The final step should be a process similar to that which we have followed for employment .
Indeed , we should end up drafting guidelines .
I hope that Stockholm too will take matters one step further .
My final point pertains to employment .
The most important is coordination of research and development policies .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , I welcome the Swedish Presidency ' s arrival .
Upon which they went home , and everything carried on as before .
We are still having to put up with stifling bureaucracy .
Moreover , I am of the opinion that the fiche d 'impact should be given the kiss of life .
It should not amount to pure guesswork but to an actual business test .
A test of how a certain piece of legislation will be received in industry .
I would like to quote the liberalisation of the postal services as a case in point .
However , I am not convinced that we are making proper use of our experience in the real economy .
You do not need a great deal of wisdom in order to determine what they are .
I am not sure if we have the courage to do so now .
( The President cut the speaker off )
( The President cut the speaker off )
They are based on the idea that such growth must be supported by structural reform .
No economic policy without this objective is possible .
Was that just an idle boast ?
The priority is clear : the promotion of innovative SMEs .
Quantum leaps need to be made in education and training .
Although the details may be assessed somewhat differently , this final report merits our support .
The most important thing is that we develop common aims .
Few have taken up this aspect .
I congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work .
Economic realism is necessary in all the targets we set ourselves within the framework of employment policy .
As the European People ' s Party , we will not be pursuing any pipe dreams .
But paper is patient .
What matters now is that these plans are put into practice .
We do not need a literature Summit .
I shall try to make a few comments .
The debate has been full of ideas and very varied , and a number of aspects have been aired .
When we analyse the employment figures , it is quite clear what results have been achieved .
We can mention public investment , as some of you have done .
But for us the important thing is the global strategy .
If we analyse the report , it is clearly demonstrated that we have advanced since then .
There is no doubt at all that comparison with other models is useful .
Throughout the morning you also debated whether the number of indicators was excessive .
In any case , the institutional agreement should also include the Council .
Another point I also find of interest is the scope of the synthesis report .
What is happening with the enlargement of the European Union ?
Would it not be appropriate to mention both subjects ?
This text , practically in the same words I have just used , is included in our synthesis report .
One point I should like to highlight is that of structural reforms .
We certainly included some specific references to structural reforms .
We must not think of liberalisation processes that do not fit into a global framework .
Many thanks for your contributions and your participation in this debate .
Free movement of persons
The next item is the joint debate on the following :
Permit me , Mr President , to take these three aspects in turn .
Firstly , let me hark back to the wording of our question .
That is what is at issue .
So , do not shake your head !
You are rejecting our right to take part in codecision .
What are the Council ' s plans in this area ?
This proposal was addressed by the Council in November 1999 .
This proposal also advocates the regulation being expanded to cover third-country nationals .
The Council is currently giving the proposal its first reading .
However , one should remember that we are addressing a technically very complicated subject .
It certainly does not seek to harmonise them .
There are three aspects to today 's debate .
I will say more on that , but touch on the other two issues as well .
We have been looking to the Council for a positive response about the speed of that overall reform .
That is why the amendments proposed and supported by the committee are technical ones .
Such workers are of course an issue for accession countries .
It was welcomed as a strong indication of the Union 's desire to be anti-discriminatory in its actions .
But the Council is playing the same game with the Commission , unfortunately .
I have also listened very carefully to the chairman , Mr Rocard , who I value greatly .
I do not need a plea for this .
The EP has a role to play in this procedure .
We are co-legislators , Mr Rocard , so that role has already been carved out for us .
Could I therefore also express my deep disappointment at the words which Minister Danielsson spoke a moment ago .
He has given any response to what Mr Rocard has said .
None whatsoever .
Mrs Lambert , there is absolutely nothing in them which is even slightly peculiar .
We mention pensions , and the Commission comes back with the proposal .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make two points .
For this very reason , Mrs Oomen-Ruijten , I do not understand your outburst .
That is why the position of the Council seems to me somewhat lacking .
From what I have heard , I am convinced that the Belgian Presidency will follow suit .
That is why we expect you to include these groups of people .
We know . We all do .
Mrs Lambert said that discrimination must be prevented .
I could not agree more , and everyone should support this view .
Do not ask me why .
Something must be done about this .
This is to be welcomed .
This will be a threat to the European economy in due course .
It is vital that mobility is established .
Certainly if this period is reduced to twelve months .
I hope that the Council will commit itself to a so-called inclusive approach .
A second important point , which has already been made , concerns frontier workers .
It is therefore high time that legislation was drafted in this field .
But there is a time and place for everything .
Let us not pursue a defeatist strategy , but rather focus our efforts on actual improvement .
It is not just about lack of social security protection .
It is about lack of recognition of qualifications .
My Group will therefore be supporting the resolution from the PPE-DE Group .
After all , the free movement of persons is still very badly regulated in Europe .
The brochure seems to be painting a rosy picture , but the reality is very different indeed .
People who make use of the free movement of persons are brought down to earth with a shock .
Just ask journalists in Brussels , for example .
They are now being covered by Belgian social security , but lose all their rights elsewhere .
Examples of this are legion .
People who experience this kind of treatment end up in a Kafkaesque situation .
Who are the architects of this system ?
They are in the Council and are keen to keep things as they are .
This is also evident from the replies .
The question now arises as to whether we want to change this or not ?
We now have another right : that of codecision .
I believe that that is not right .
This is today ' s topic of discussion .
If we were to adopt this approach in other codecision matters , we would not make much progress .
That proves just how odd this procedure is here today .
That also proves that we are on the wrong track .
I hope that this will prove to be the case in a year ' s time .
Our group is also of the opinion that pressure should be stepped up .
Quite the reverse in fact .
This is not why we pursue this strategy .
The working classes in Greece have already mobilised in the face of this attack .
Similar action is being taken in other countries .
The Council fully understands the frustration apparent in many of the speeches in this debate .
I would nonetheless repeat what I said in my introduction .
We believe this is extremely important .
We hope to be able to agree on a continued timetable for the work .
In this I will remove my Council hat and put on my national hat .
We did not succeed in Nice , but we do not intend to give up .
I can agree fully with the proposals contained in Amendments Nos 1 to 7 in the report .
Therefore the Commission cannot accept the other additional amendments on supplementary pensions .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon .
Question Time ( Council )
The next item is Questions to the Council ( B5-0007 / 2001 ) .
First Mr Alavanos has a point of order .
It does not contain any more opinions or assertions than most questions tabled by Members .
I have listened carefully to your legal and political arguments on the matter and I shall pass them on .
As they deal with the same subject , Questions Nos 1 and 2 will be taken together .
Question No 1 by ( H-0015 / 01 ) :
Question No 2 by ( H-0022 / 01 ) :
This responsibility is stated in Article 11.1 of the Treaty on European Union .
Thank you for your answer , but my question was about the UN mandate .
Mr Danielsson said nothing about this .
But what about the mandate ?
Is a mandate needed ?
We must have a clear answer to this .
That is my question .
I once again refer to the ' capacity declaration ' .
I do not think it is possible to be any clearer than that is .
As such , it is a case of belt and braces regarding this issue .
I believe we can sleep soundly in our beds .
European crisis management will be carried out in line with the principles of the UN Charter .
It is not about the general principles .
It is not about spirit or other higher values .
Or yes , such a mandate must be obtained .
I would like to be given a yes or no answer .
I think that should count for a great deal .
There are , as likely as not , people who draw the conclusion that no UN mandate is required .
And that is a scandal .
We need to do it in line with the OSCE ' s principles .
I can only regret that we cannot really agree on this important issue .
Question No 3 by ( H-0031 / 01 ) :
This has been reflected in the conclusion from the European Councils up to and including the Nice Summit .
The Swedish Presidency is actively proceeding with the task assigned by the European Council in Nice .
It must be possible to mobilise 1 000 police within 30 days .
Moreover , the monitoring mission recently showed its value when it was deployed in Presevo Valley .
The Council will then be better able to assess what other arrangements might be warranted or necessary .
Mr Danielsson ' s replies to question after question are like the complete non sequitur ' goddag yxskaft ' .
My question was also one with a yes or no answer .
Does the Council intend to take any initiative on the basis of this recommendation ?
Yes or no ?
It is very easy to answer yes or no .
I understand that my long reply was somewhat too comprehensive for Mr Gahrton .
Let me therefore try to summarise it as follows :
No now .
Yes possibly later .
Question No 4 by ( H-0018 / 01 ) :
As we all know , Turkey is also a member of NATO .
This is also sometimes the case with regard to military cooperation .
I would not say that the majority of the Swedish people is a small group .
I also know that these issues are being discussed in all Member States .
I have a supplementary question concerning the forces which are to make up the EU rapid reaction force .
Does the presidency have any views on the appropriateness of this ?
I also believe that I answered this question on that occasion .
Mr Sjöstedt must accept responsibility for his statement .
I cannot verify it .
Question No 5 by ( H-0023 / 01 ) :
However , the fourth directive affords no solution to settlement procedures currently under way .
I will be brief .
We are currently awaiting such proposals .
However , I shall do this on my own behalf , not on behalf of the Council .
Question No 6 by ( H-0026 / 01 ) :
According to Community law , national laws are not harmonised where they apply to Member States ' documents .
This proposal was tabled by the Commission on 21 February 2000 .
Mr Bonde is fully aware of the deadline set for this work .
I am extremely moved by , and grateful for , Mr Bonde ' s concern over Swedish legislation .
Mr Bonde asks an important question .
However , Mr Schmidt need not worry .
Question No 7 by ( H-0027 / 01 ) :
The Council ' s subordinate bodies are currently looking at a proposal from the Commission on this matter .
Mr President , I should like in fact to reformulate the question .
In Austria , the European Member States interfered when faced with the threat of xenophobia .
I believe this question is so serious that it requires some special action .
The work on this problem must consist of two elements .
I am convinced that with joint efforts we can achieve success .
This is an important issue under the Swedish Presidency .
We are working actively on this issue .
I was the rapporteur for that plan .
However , it is not for the president of the Council to comment on efforts by individual Member States .
Therefore I ask you to make a point of order .
Mr Nogueira has the floor .
We can consider this incident over , as is natural .
Mr Hernández Mollar has the floor for a point of order .
You are both protected by your legitimate rights .
I am not going to allow any more points of order .
There will not be a debate on this .
That is what the Treaties say and we all know it .
As they deal with the same subject , Questions Nos 8 and 9 will be taken together .
Question No 8 by ( H-0032 / 01 ) :
According to its information , how many women are subjected to this fundamentalist regime ?
Will the Council appeal to Afghanistan ' s neighbours to leave their borders open to Afghan refugee women ?
Will the European Union then grant financial support to those countries which admit refugee women ?
Question No 9 by ( H-0052 / 01 ) :
The Taliban control around 90 % of the territory of Afghanistan .
The majority of this aid benefits women .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I appreciate your reply but it does not go far enough .
We need something more than understanding , as you must realise .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , will you not recommend that some emergency measure should be adopted ?
How many more children will have to die of cold ?
How many million women will have to live without rights or freedoms ?
( The President cut the speaker off )
That is false , and this particular case in Afghanistan shows it to be so .
Surely more is needed than has been offered in the statement today .
We are facing a situation of inhuman suffering for women and children .
Question No 10 by ( H-0040 / 01 ) :
Question No 11 by ( H-0041 / 01 ) :
Question No 12 by ( H-0042 / 01 ) :
Question No 13 by ( H-0043 / 01 ) :
Question No 14 by ( H-0044 / 01 ) :
Question No 15 by ( H-0045 / 01 ) :
Question No 16 by ( H-0046 / 01 ) :
The participation of Parliament will be ensured in accordance with the provisions of the treaty .
Both are to be presented by the Commission in the next few weeks .
I would be interested to know what provisions you are making for the future .
The honourable Member raises a very relevant question .
We now have experience from a number of Council constellations .
Some have done very good work , whilst others have perhaps been less successful .
Mr President-in-Office , thank you for that very wide-ranging answer .
I wanted to focus in particular on the General Affairs Council .
Will we see a draft before Gothenburg .
The honourable Member thinks there is very little time left before the Gothenburg Summit .
Mr President-in-Office , thank you for your reply .
In fact , I am very worried about how this process is to move forward .
I would like you , Mr President-in-Office , to explain your purpose regarding this matter .
The action plan for sustainable development is after all to be presented by the Commission .
The question should therefore , in the first instance , be put to the Members of the Commission .
These should be the ecological element , the economic element and the social element .
I think I have partly indicated the answer to these questions already .
Obviously , each Council constellation is doing its work in this area .
As I have already pointed out , the framework will then be the strategy that the Commission will present .
I too should like to thank the President-in-Office for his answer .
What concrete measures does the presidency propose ?
I do not think the Council has been particularly active in the past .
I know that the Swedish Presidency wants to change that and involve citizens more extensively and be more transparent .
I want some information about that and specifically about the Industry Council .
The Council is committed to a full-blown strategy by 2004 .
What short-term targets or actions and indicators will be needed to ensure its full development ?
How will the external impact of the industry strategy be evaluated ?
You have also referred at length to energy .
Energy efficiency is an important priority .
We have a report about to go before this House in Brussels .
Will you take any steps on the action plan for energy efficiency ?
The honourable Member has put three very extensive questions .
I will attempt to answer them as briefly as possible .
There are great many concrete plans , but the Council has not yet had opportunity to discuss this .
Consequently I must ask to be allowed to come back to you with more concrete news .
We expect the Council ( Transport ) to meet in early April of this year .
We shall then be able to obtain answers to the questions that the Member has put .
However , I would not dare to be more precise than this .
Question No 17 by ( H-0050 / 01 ) :
The Commission report to which Mrs Paulsen refers deals in the first instance with transportation of animals .
I am very aware that the country holding the presidency does not control the agenda entirely itself .
However , initiatives can be taken in the matter of work in progress .
In this context , I would like us to review the agricultural policy as such .
The export subsidies make the very worst transportation profitable .
I can only agree with what the honourable Member says .
I can assure you that the presidency regards this matter as having the utmost priority .
Above all , improvements are required .
I believe we are entirely in agreement in this area .
The facts in this area are in many cases horrendous .
Question No 18 by ( H-0054 / 01 ) :
Does it intend to work towards this goal with the governments concerned ?
What preventive measures does it intend to take ?
It is therefore not possible for the Council to comment on the question that has been put .
That concludes Questions to the Council .
( The sitting was suspended at 7 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
Reorganisation and winding-up of insurance undertakings
Approval at first reading by Parliament followed on 14 March 1989 .
The directive was to spend the next eleven years on a shelf at the Council of Ministers .
The second reading is now formally before Parliament .
This is the universality principle .
The directive must ensure that creditors are treated equally .
I would therefore recommend my fellow MEPs to adopt the Council ' s common position without any amendments .
The Council has allowed eleven years to elapse .
The idea and the need for a directive are therefore justified and the outcome is to be welcomed .
It will avoid conflicts of jurisdiction and the unequal treatment of insurance creditors .
They recommend that the text of the common position be kept as it is without any amendment .
I fully share their opinion .
So the system works .
The debate is closed .
I am sure the serene attitude is due to the composure of the rapporteur .
The vote , if any , will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
The Union and Macao beyond 2000
The Chinese idea is completely the opposite - ' one country , two systems ' .
This is a mistake which still needs to be corrected .
I have already passed this information to the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
This was a very important point for Macau , and still is .
Relations between Hong Kong and Macau are and have always been excellent .
As a matter of fact , this was his first trip abroad .
In principle , the European Union is supposed to appoint its own permanent representative in Macau .
This is important and I believe that it has already been done .
There is a Portuguese high school in Macau which is thriving and where Portuguese continues to be taught .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I rise to speak for two basic reasons .
This report , which bears his stamp and his signature , increases the credibility of the European Parliament .
Mr President , I would like to commend the rapporteur on his excellent report .
I welcome the fact that Macau 's crime rate has also improved .
Overall , progress has been made since the handover and that progress can be described as satisfactory .
I just wanted to tell you that I read this text with great interest .
I am of the view that the European Union should not underestimate this issue .
For us , the relationship between Europe and its Asiatic partners is of strategic importance .
Despite its relatively small size , Macao has an extraordinary bridging function .
It is also the basis for improved cooperation in those areas where Macao has retained its autonomy .
We intend to develop our trade as much as we can and the situation is improving .
We are pleased that last year was good for Macao 's economy .
Economic growth was positive , reaching 4 % for the first time since 1996 .
I can report that EU-Macao relations remain extremely good .
The Joint Committee held its annual meeting in Brussels on 30 June 2000 .
We continue to consider the appointment of the technical cooperation officer very important .
All in all , the situation in Macao has been positive .
I know that the Commission will be keen to discuss with him the most recent developments in Macao .
I hope that some of you will also have the opportunity to meet him .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
EC / Mexico Agreement ( economic partnership , political coordination and cooperation )
First and most important is the issue of poverty in Mexico .
I will outline some of these in a moment .
Indeed the liberalisation covers very nearly all sectors .
So its terms and scope are very far-reaching .
Parliament should support civil society in Mexico , which is asking for this unconstitutional provision to be changed .
There are a number of key issues which I have raised which must be on that agenda .
It must include effective monitoring of human rights .
Thank you , Mr President , and now I shall begin my intervention .
This agreement establishes the bases for closer relations between the European Union and Mexico .
We shall obviously be voting in favour .
But this agreement , like everything else in life , can be improved .
Why can 't the UK do the same I thought .
Actually that sensitivity is not confined to this Parliament .
We would much rather make our own agreements on our own terms .
It seems then , that the rule of law prevails in Mexico .
I must also mention that in 1999 the democracy clause was included in this agreement .
Mr President , it has already been said that our group will approve the Council proposal .
Mexico is an important country .
It is the largest Spanish-speaking country in the world .
Accordingly , this agreement is of great political importance .
For us , the agreement with Mexico has a high priority .
Implementing the Mexico agreement therefore serves a pilot function .
As far as our foreign trade policy is concerned , this will improve our trading situation in Mexico .
The share of Europe ' s trade with Mexico has fallen back to simply ridiculously low levels .
This , I believe , is a truism .
While approving the EU / Mexico agreement , we should nevertheless honour the fact that Mexico is changing .
Mexico now ranks among the states in which democratic changeovers of power will become the norm .
What is more , this works in both directions .
We consider this agreement a milestone in future relations with Latin American countries .
A side agreement on cooperation on human rights is to be envisaged .
I will follow it closely .
Mr President , we gladly give the agreement between the European Union and Mexico the benefit of the doubt .
A courageous goal in the face of huge resistance , both politically and socially .
However , that is primarily a domestic matter , in our opinion .
. ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we have an interesting case before us .
I have two specific points to make .
The relevant precautions are lacking , as is positive assistance to Mexico .
The NAFTA agreement has played an important role in this .
We both accepted the challenge and decided to adapt our relations .
It entered into force on 1 July 2000 .
The later text , which we are debating today , will liberalise services in two phases .
The European Parliament has been invited to give its opinion on this second decision .
But this decision has also a bigger impact .
We should be satisfied by what we have achieved in this area .
It is a new , very ambitious beginning .
It was about the agenda of the joint Council meeting on 27 February .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon .
Facilitation of unauthorised entry and residence
Unfortunately , they are still dying .
Every week , we read at least two reports about this sad state of affairs .
For this reason , the European Union must act without delay .
I must admit that both initiatives could actually be offered as a single initiative .
They could be combined into a single proposal on the same legal base , that of the first pillar .
Unfortunately , I was unable to convince the French Interior Minister .
That is why a correction was crucial .
It really would have been the easiest thing for us to simply declare the matter settled in five minutes .
But , given the fate of the victims , that would have been irresponsible .
I very much regret that the PPE-DE is not prepared to back this report .
The balance of power , in that sense , has certainly shifted .
I was privileged to be an immigration minister in the last government .
Of course there is a difficulty with the implementation of a common immigration and asylum policy .
I , as a British Conservative , have doubts about that .
We are not yet ready .
We do not yet have that policy in place .
Given that such a policy may be implemented , this report appears at an inopportune moment .
Amendments underlining the importance of that convention are certainly welcomed by me and the EPP .
We support the French initiative .
We merely regret that this report has appeared before its time and is unacceptable .
Mr President , I am sorry , I was confused about the time .
Sanctions must be proportionate and balanced and the punishment must be made to fit the crime .
Recently , we saw drowned people washed up on the Spanish coast .
This is an inhumane business .
Joint efforts are required here at EU level .
It seems that the only thing that can be agreed upon is repressive measures .
I do not believe it is .
The EU is in the process of building a Fortress Europe .
The Liberal Group would have liked to have seen a more comprehensive programme on migration issues .
A common policy is required in this area .
Relatives , friends or individual organisations must not be punished for this .
A distinction must be made .
For the most part they fall victim to smugglers and traffickers .
We should point out that some legal immigrants have been made illegal by restrictive legislation .
Some of these have been living in Europe for over twenty years .
They can no longer be expelled , nor can their situation be regularised .
What means is available to them to earn a living and support their families ?
The solutions laid down in the proposed initiatives replicate these repressive measures and grounds for exclusion .
Who is really responsible ?
These initiatives , therefore , lump all categories together in an inadmissible and dangerous fashion .
The disease is , of course , the fact that there are 20 million refugees in the world .
That means more money from desperate people in the pockets of the mafia .
There will be fewer suppliers and ever more demand . That means higher prices .
We know this , of course , from the market economy in general .
I have to say that the rapporteur has done his best to temper the proposal .
Our group will , of course , support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur and the Liberal Group .
Criminal law cannot be removed from parliamentary debate .
Our frontiers are being overwhelmed by the illegality produced by our prohibitionist laws . That is the reality .
At the same time , the fundamental economic causes are not being addressed .
Illegal immigration , which is growing rapidly , is indeed becoming a major problem for the countries of Europe .
Europol currently estimates that 500 000 illegal immigrants enter the European Union every year .
This influx of marginalised individuals provides a breeding ground for all sorts of crime and exploitation .
I also agree that these texts have been brought out at just the right time .
There is a clear need for such action as a matter of urgency .
The French Republic ' s initiatives on illegal immigration must therefore be approved , followed up and reinforced .
It is therefore going to expire on 30 April 2004 .
What we must do is target those who assist illegal immigration .
We have also to recognise that this report is just one piece of a jigsaw .
It is a very difficult jigsaw that we are trying to put together .
Are they the organisations that we ought to be legislating against ?
I would say not .
That is why we need these measures .
We must do more .
But we cannot do that overnight .
We must therefore receive the two French initiatives with satisfaction .
I really do not understand at all .
We must , however , clarify the terms of the debate properly .
Our first concern is about the legal basis , which is not a minor issue .
This , as I see it , is especially true in this case .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon .
( The sitting was closed at 11.20 p.m. )
Research guidelines 2002 - 2006
The creation of a European Research Area is vital to this .
The European Framework Programmes of research and technological development have definitely contributed to this as well .
Let us do away with techno-nationalism .
In addition , we invest significantly less in research than the United States and Japan .
More coordination at a programme level is also necessary .
Only then will we also achieve cooperation such as that between centres of excellence .
I therefore call upon Commissioners Liikanen and Busquin to show much more ambition in this matter .
Greater harmony between higher education and researcher training is necessary as well .
I would like to hear the Commissioner 's point of view on this matter .
This forms a central part of Commissioner Busquin 's plans .
Another point is the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field of research .
That was successful too .
It appears that even more funding is going to small and medium-sized enterprises from the Fifth Framework Programme .
I think that that is a slight reversal of the procedure .
It wastes that brain power because it fails to engage women in the task of science adequately .
This must be a key part of the European Research Area .
I am glad that the report takes these questions on board .
I hope the Commission will also take this into account .
Lastly , of course , there is the question of intellectual property .
I think we must not be overcautious .
We must also invigorate it through joint efforts in the field of major infrastructure .
These days , one could no doubt call it a benchmarking exercise .
However , when all is said and done , we have confidence that you will succeed .
That is another dimension , but it is a crucial one .
First , we must move towards closer European integration in research .
We want national programmes to be more accessible at European level .
At each step , we must try to create a real European added value .
Three , we must also consider introducing new tools .
It is clear that the Sixth Framework Programme we are beginning to work on is the most important one .
We must renew it and make it more accessible , more flexible and more legible .
Five , we must continue to promote pure science .
In many fields the EU is already a scientific superpower .
They should be opening up their projects to others more .
The key concept here is that of European added value .
The Commission document also addresses the question of the mobility of students , researchers and scientists .
I welcome that .
I am glad that the role of the SMEs has been acknowledged .
Needless to say , the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the report .
( Applause from the gallery )
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I thank Commissioner Busquin for presenting this opinion .
The unanimity of our general aims , however , does not make them any easier to achieve in practice .
We shall try to assist you in your efforts .
However , as soon as it comes to putting the theory into practice , questions inevitably start to arise .
The devil is not only in the detail .
So what clearly defined criteria will you be using to set these priorities , Commissioner ?
All I can say is ' Have fun ! '
Congratulations to the rapporteur - we shall continue our cooperation .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel , for her excellent work .
Similarly I would like to thank the Commissioner for a very thorough presentation .
It is in this way different , therefore , from plain information .
The situation being as it is , I will make two proposals .
Europe would have much to do in such a project .
This is a major factor in the changes taking place today and an enormous challenge in terms of research .
For that we would need a study undertaken , as it affects us all .
I would like to fill in an important piece of detail within the framework .
The biotechnology industry can make a major contribution to achieving this ambition .
At present there is much despondency , even despair in certain areas of research .
The principle of establishing a European Research Area was accepted at the Lisbon Summit .
It has become a political fact .
We must consider how we propose to achieve this .
It is indeed a project that concerns all European scientists .
So that is the spirit in which the instruments proposed by the Commission were defined .
In fact , we should use that term rather than referring to ' giant ' centres .
These are not ' giant ' centres of excellence .
They are networks with a capacity for excellence , depending on the subject and field of research .
That is obviously one of the questions on which the discussions will focus .
We therefore believe that it is up to the Member States to take the initiative .
It will be a major theme of that discussion .
On SMEs , Members are clearly right to emphasise their importance .
Let me now tell Mr Caudron that European added value is clearly the key component .
How should we define it ?
I think it should be defined according to the research projects in question .
The concept of European added value is not a global one .
You referred to the meeting on nuclear fusion .
I think we cannot avoid a debate on this question .
Indeed , it has already been discussed in earlier debates on the previous Framework Programmes .
Clearly there is also the question of international cooperation .
The international dimension must always form part of the debate .
Let me close by once again thanking her and all the Members for their contributions .
Thank you very much for your address , Commissioner . We certainly did not find it too long .
It was very relevant and much appreciated .
Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl asked very clearly what the criteria are for prioritisation .
We do not want to be told that they are general criteria .
We asked for a clear description of the criteria for research priorities .
We as a committee would very much like an answer .
Then matters will be even more clearly defined .
We shall , of course , have scope to discuss this when we come to prepare the new programme .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
The Community needs 4.5 million tonnes of unginned cotton .
Since then , international prices have doubled .
We therefore feel that it is essential for the European Parliament to support the producers ' call for aid .
However , in my opinion the Commission ' s proposal is too minimalist .
In short , Mr President , this is all about social and economic sensitivity .
Furthermore , cotton has replaced other intensive crops which generate more pollution and greater surpluses .
Firstly , it proposes adjusting the national guaranteed quantities in line with actual production .
We have had some apposite experience of such ideas in the past .
This will give us a framework that will make it easier to negotiate future agreements .
This is intended to apply to environmental measures in particular .
Moreover , the creation of producers ' organisations has been financed by the Community for the past ten years .
Thank you , Commissioner Fischler .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
Financing of quality and marketing improvement plans
I do believe that granting over-generous aid in favourable market situations should be avoided .
I am not in favour of granting aid as if it were a lottery .
The aid we are proposing now really is necessary .
We import products of this nature to the detriment of the agricultural workers I am speaking for .
Commissioner , you ought to be taking note of what I am saying because this constitutes a precedent .
We are happy to show solidarity .
Will the Commission allow European aid to the agricultural sector to be cut off ?
And does this mean that European agriculture will no longer receive preferential treatment ?
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo , you too have gone one minute over your time .
Nevertheless , we ought to keep to our speaking times .
This is what the rapporteur is proposing and this is what we hope the Commission will put right .
This was the basis on which the Commission drew up its proposal .
Secondly , specific aid for hazelnuts is not covered by the proposal .
Thank you , Commissioner Fischler .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
( The sitting was suspended at 11.47 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon . )
Under Rule 68 , we would normally ask the Council to withdraw the proposal .
I hope I have made myself clear !
Mr Watson , you put that very neatly .
We can do that and there is a precedent .
I can confirm that , as is being communicated to me on my headphones by the services .
We can do it in accordance with the procedure that you propose .
Mr Poettering has the floor .
Mr President , a moment ago you quite rightly asked where the Council was .
The Council ought to be delivering an opinion .
Mr Poettering , in my opinion you are completely correct .
I shall ensure that the President , Mrs Fontaine , communicates our displeasure to the Council .
I concur with the warm applause for Mr Poettering on that point .
Mr President , I should just like Parliament to be clear about what it is voting on here .
Mr Watson , you , and some others with you , were momentarily confused .
The vote is completely clear .
If you want it rejected you must vote in favour .
I give the floor to the rapporteur .
Mr President , I believe it is important that the rapporteur says a brief word on this .
I regret that we have not managed to exercise our parliamentary responsibility .
But Mr Watson is right , and we should support him .
I appeal for the support of every Member , otherwise we shall make our Parliament look ridiculous .
( Applause and protests )
Mr President , I do not wish to speak on the subject of the debate .
The PPE-DE proposal that was rejected is a mere nuance .
By no stretch of the imagination is it one of the cornerstones of the resolution .
( Loud sustained applause )
Lambert Report ( A5-0026 / 2001 )
It is high time that the issue of European Union citizens ' pensions was dealt with properly .
Specifically however , we have voted against Amendments Nos 8 onwards .
Free movement of persons
We do not agree with that .
If this is not the case , we shall vote against .
I think that this discussion should never have taken place in the European Parliament .
So I voted against the whole resolution .
If another legal basis is required , the Treaty must , in our view , be altered .
However , the EPLP does not support the view that the legal base should be Article 42 and 308 .
Lucas Report ( A5-0036 / 2001 )
We therefore voted against this report .
Ceyhun Report ( A5-0315 / 2000 )
" Wolf !
In fact , his cry " Wolf !
To which the shepherd boy replied " Ha ha !
It 's a joke .
There isn 't a wolf ! "
Three days later , he shouted again : " Wolf !
Wolf ! "
All the villagers arrived asking : " Where is the wolf ? "
" Ha ha ha !
It 's a joke .
There isn 't a wolf ! "
A week later , a wolf really came and started to tear the sheep to pieces .
" Wolf !
Wolf ! " , cried the shepherd boy , but nobody came from the village to help .
And the wolf ate all the sheep .
I find the amendments initially adopted by the European Parliament particularly regrettable .
This was a completely erroneous position , but I shall not harp on the subject .
Such exceptions were completely inappropriate .
In particular , these " humanitarian " smugglers must not be exempted from prosecution .
Since they are unable to cure the illness , they opt to penalise the victims .
The latter should be received in all Member States and granted asylum .
What is an illegal refugee ?
I recognise that deported asylum seekers often find themselves in a distressing position .
But a more nuanced definition is required .
Apart from that , how do you define ' humanitarian aid ' ?
The dramatic circumstances of illegal immigration are a humanitarian disgrace .
Accordingly , I support the proposals of the French Government .
The rapporteur seeks to punish only the smugglers and organisation involved in illegal immigration networks .
How can we fail to be outraged at this ?
Illegal immigration should not be encouraged in any way whatsoever .
The fundamental problem , the unequal distribution of wealth among humankind , is not solved in this way .
It is right that this mafia should be tackled .
The Ceyhun report moves in the right direction , but is still inadequate .
We nonetheless believe that the framework decision in favour of common penalties needs to be improved .
Korakas Report ( A5-0022 / 2001 )
" What 's the matter ? " I replied .
I am tired of rising from the lake naked .
I am cold , absolutely freezing .
The Commission 's proposals for cotton are unacceptable because :
the European Union produces too little cotton
the principle of Community preference is being blatantly violated
the minimum guaranteed quantities do not match actual production .
We therefore need to :
cost inflation over recent years into the price of cotton
exempt small growers from coresponsibility levies
give professional organisations a proper say in the qualitative assessment of the product
take special steps to support small growers .
Both reports call for the protectionist measures , such as preservation of the system for community preference .
We believe that EU funds should instead be spent on purposes where cross-border cooperation is needed .
The common agricultural policy of today has lost its political legitimacy and must be completely reformed .
All aid to exports and production should be abolished .
Agriculture needs to adapt to market rules in order to be exposed to competition .
We therefore have to import the balance .
And all this benefits the United States and Australia .
Oh no , there is no such excuse in the case of cotton .
It is not like the milk sector , where quotas can be justified due to overproduction .
Our sacrifices are not justified in terms of assisting the 48 least developed countries .
Europe is blocking production and the only beneficiaries are the United States and Australia .
We saw this in the case of Californian almonds , and in the case of bananas .
Now we have cotton too .
Both crops have their disadvantages .
Tobacco is bad for public health .
Its starting premise is the protection and expansion of production and the creation of the financial preconditions for that .
Izquierdo Rojo Report ( A5-0035 / 2001 )
The Commission 's new proposal extends the programmes which were maintained for a further year .
Restructuring operations and mergers in industry
The question we ask is why should it be the workers that have to pay the price of competitiveness ?
The level of ongoing unemployment in continental Europe is far too high .
More regulation is the problem , not the solution .
Like Danone , major European companies are currently making colossal profits .
These tens of thousands of redundancies for the benefit of a few dozen shareholders should be prohibited .
However , we have reservations on the resolution itself .
However there are aspects which are not supported .
Paragraph 6 is not supported by the EPLP .
Lipietz Report ( A5-0023 / 2001 )
Bullmann Report ( A5-0034 / 2001 )
But for this to happen we need less words and more action .
The ELDR Group therefore chose to vote against the proposal as a whole .
I apologise , and I shall convey my apology directly to Mr Bullmann .
Yet the proposals of the Bullmann report could well have vastly accentuated this sideways shift .
We must not slide down the slippery slope from open coordination to closed planning .
Instead , I want the Stockholm Summit to focus upon liberalisation and dynamic deregulation .
It is important to emphasise that politicians do not create jobs .
Politicians can , at best , help create a more favourable business climate .
Gasòliba i Böhm Report ( A5-0020 / 2001 )
With shocking cynicism , the rapporteur proposes full liberalisation of the market and deregulation .
Prosperity is , of course , being promoted for big business , which is becoming more and more unaccountable .
Is this a stylistic infelicity or a Freudian slip betraying an inner conviction ?
Where is the much-promised social progress in all that ?
We voted against this report .
In actual fact , the hardline neoliberal programme is being affirmed once again in two major areas .
I had no hesitation in voting against this resolution .
Soares Report ( A5-0017 / 2001 )
Portugal governed Macau for four hundred years .
We are not ashamed of our past in that region , in fact , quite the opposite .
Plooij-van Gorsel Report ( A5-0052 / 2001 )
I still had to prepare my explanation of vote on the Plooij-van Gorsel report .
Therefore , with this in mind , I voted for the report .
Once again we have been served a balanced menu which is nothing of the sort .
No one is fooled by the fact that the report only makes reference to SMEs .
All major corporations have small and medium-sized enterprises as subsidiaries , particularly in the field of research .
We voted against this report .
For all the above reasons , I voted against .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.41p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
Situation in Kosovo
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0143 / 01 by Mr Haarder , on behalf of the ELDR Group , on Kosovo .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let us note the absence of the Commission and of the Council .
I find this perfectly unacceptable .
All eyes are on Belgrade .
Only UNMIK and the international tribunal in The Hague would be authorised to sentence these people .
As soon as he gets here , I will be able to tell you , Mr Posselt .
That is the moment - and the moment is now - that the balancing act is most difficult .
What is the task of the EU ?
Once again , President , I can imagine easier tasks .
We are speaking today about southern Serbia and Kosovo .
We are not discussing Serbia and current policy in Serbia proper .
I agree with much of what you said , Olivier .
But let me come back to today ' s debate .
It is a matter of how things stand now in Kosovo .
I agree with Mr Lagendijk on this point .
The problem , in a nutshell , is that Mr Hækkerup will have to call elections very soon .
To do that , he must know what powers the elected bodies will have .
But we need these bodies so that the Serbian side has Kosovar negotiating partners .
Now we have the subject of southern Serbia .
Where have the weapons come from for these new extremists ?
They have , of course , been transferred from the old KLA to the new KLA .
I appeal to KFOR to do so , lest we lose our credibility in that corner of the Balkans .
They want to be part of everything that Yugoslav citizenship implies .
I believe the government ' s new plan is good .
It is pursuing the right path , and we should support it .
Why should we not play a part ?
We are good mediators .
We must now protect the Serbs , who are minority in Kosovo .
There is no-one from the press .
It is both paradoxical and frivolous .
Perhaps there are employees in other walks of life who would welcome a similar arrangement .
But now to the topic itself .
Public opinion in our own countries demanded determined action such as was eventually taken .
It also contributed to Milosevic being discredited and defeated a few months later .
All of this is incompatible with the objectives pursued by the European Union and we must not tolerate it .
I believe we must see that as an absolutely fundamental principle .
Very many colleagues have been there and know what the situation is like .
Of course I was in favour of that , but we are now at a turning point .
We are at a moment when we are moving from emergency aid to structural help .
I believe that this is a turning point that we must take advantage of .
That means , in the first instance , the release of prisoners .
We have still made no progress at all with this .
This is a real scandal .
If one comes into contact with Albanian Kosovars , that is the first thing they ask about .
It is important , however , that the measures taken should be realistic .
The present problems cannot be solved overnight .
They can only be solved by a consensus of all interested parties , states and ethnic groups .
Only the European Union enjoys that level of trust .
And if Europe were caught napping now , that would pose serious problems .
I can only agree with another of the previous speakers , Mr Posselt , on the money issue .
It must be different in the Balkans .
Mr President , the Commission shares most of the concerns referred to in the resolutions .
This is indeed important . Milosevic never attempted to do so .
The principle of negotiation and dialogue warrants our support and will receive it .
This currently amounts to approximately EUR 1 million for fuel and for educational and humanitarian programmes .
For their part , the Member States are considering how they could contribute .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
The Democratic Republic of the Congo is no exception to this rule .
We must ask the new Head of State to lift the ban affecting political parties .
Mr President , the death of Laurent-Désiré Kabila has opened new perspectives for peace .
He was eliminated by the very people who helped bring him to power .
The young Kabila has awakened high expectations .
The time has now come for him to act .
Others mainly try to secure their own economic interests .
There are limits to cynicism .
They are criminals who are preaching to the victims of their own criminal action .
Mr President , under Kabila Sr. , the peace process had ground to a halt .
There is new hope in the air now that his son has become president .
Peace is only possible if all foreign troops are withdrawn .
The dividing up of the country is not an acceptable option .
Even the so-called rebels will have to recognise territorial integrity .
But they will only do so if Kabila and his friends are prepared to share power in the country .
Without the democratisation of political life no lasting stability is possible in Congo .
The poor population has to make do with emergency humanitarian aid .
The poor Congo could be rich .
It has large mineral resources and the population is predominantly very young and very dynamic .
They deserve the efforts of all involved to breathe new life into the hope for peace .
A country where both production and supply are achievable only with great difficulty .
A country that is , moreover , wedged between Rwanda and Uganda .
Europe must not remain passive in the face of developments in Central Africa .
These people are being held captive by guerrilla forces fighting for the independence of Cabinda .
Mr President , the European Union obviously condemns political violence in all its forms .
We shall certainly be monitoring developments closely .
However , we are endeavouring to do even more in terms of financial assistance and humanitarian aid .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , China is on the agenda once again .
What I am describing here is the situation now , not the situation during the Cultural Revolution .
Parliament has a duty to take an extremely firm stance .
The resolution is a good text .
I would particularly like to thank Mrs Malmström , who played an instrumental role in this task .
That is a great pity .
This process needs to be reactivated .
We should also respect the way in which institutions define themselves .
Secondly , the repression against Falun Gong is totally absurd .
Can you imagine repression against all the people who ever follow yoga classes in Europe ?
Mr President , what was it that Karl Marx said ?
It is the opium of the people . "
Marxism-Leninism is in terminal decline , but other ideologies have survived .
The Tibetans are persecuted .
It is an offence to display pictures of the Dalai Lama .
Those who stand up for their beliefs face the threat of lengthy prison sentences .
I hope that our European Commission will show the same powers of initiative .
Tashi delek !
Over half a century later the heirs to that revolution are still in power .
That bodes ill for ethnic and religious minorities and those with political criticisms .
Organisations are banned , people are locked up and death sentences are liberally used .
My group believes that an end should be put to this special treatment .
Torture is on the increase .
There is frequent use of the death penalty . Freedom of expression is limited .
The Chinese have extremely limited opportunities to practise their religion .
Catholics report systematic persecution .
Mosques are burned down .
In Tibet , the oppression of the Tibetan people , especially of Buddhist monks , continues .
Ever since the ban , tens of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners have been arrested .
At least 137 people have died in prison .
That is completely unacceptable .
I would like to thank all the Members who contributed to this work .
We have given a lot of attention in Parliament to the question of Burma .
But things are hardly any better in neighbouring countries .
Laos is one of the world ' s poorest countries .
All the negative features of a one-party system are manifest there .
In October 1999 , a demonstration was organised in front of the presidential palace against the ruling powers .
Those who took part in it have not been seen since .
The importance of these objectives should really be clearly emphasised .
We now wish to see an improvement .
We call for this to be done in the name of human liberty and solidarity .
The organisers of the earlier demonstration were arrested and are still in prison .
This commitment must henceforth be backed up with real action .
The compromise resolution is well-balanced , clear and specific .
They are all members of the Lao student movement for democracy .
Their safety is feared for because of the torture and poor treatment in the prisons .
They must be able to contribute freely .
Freedom of expression , the right of association and assembly are greatly restricted in Laos .
Inflation is currently running at over 30 % .
The mysterious bomb explosions are damaging the largest economic factor in the country , tourism .
But , all this is not enough .
The causes of this humanitarian disaster must be tackled .
We must do all that we can to bring this to an end .
West Africans themselves are doing great work in this direction .
Liberia is the destabilising factor in the region .
The situation is critical .
In my view , that is the least it could do .
Obviously , it is justifiable and understandable for Guinea to defend itself against any incursion .
I am even of the opinion that the territorial integrity of a state like Guinea must be protected .
We can help to achieve this .
At first , that did not apply to Guinea .
Now Guinea , too , is caught up in a regional struggle for power .
There is nowhere else for the refugees to go .
If a corridor is not quickly created , an unparalleled humanitarian disaster threatens .
There is a great deal at stake .
The whole region seems to be heading for chaos .
The purchase of weapons is more important than feeding people .
Above all , Charles Taylor must take Liberia in hand .
It is harrowing to see how indulgently Europe , too , is reacting to this catastrophe .
They were still preparing the case for her appeal in court .
No attempt has been made to bring those who abused and exploited her to justice .
The resolution we have before us sends out two clear messages .
Mr President , I want to thank Mrs Evans for her contribution on this subject .
We are the people who buy and sell almost all the things they want to buy and sell .
We have an obligation to examine the record in human rights of the people we do business with .
Freedom of expression in Pakistan
This highlights the appalling state of affairs that we now see with the present regime in power in Pakistan .
Since 1991 , Islamic Sharia law has applied in Pakistan .
The precepts and prohibitions laid down in the Koran are the supreme law of the land .
Freedom of expression and the freedom of the press have been severely curtailed .
It must be abolished .
These individuals ' lives are now at risk .
Fundamentalists have set fire to the newspaper ' s offices in Peshawar .
The country is now becoming ever more marginalised in the world community .
The situation in Pakistan is very disquieting .
Later , I shall be talking a little about Falun Gong .
You referred specifically in your speeches to three topics which I think are of interest .
As for action in connection with Tibet , we are indeed still concerned about the ethnic minorities there .
Some of you have asked what we are going to do about these matters .
We fully support CEDEAO ' s attempts at mediation .
At present , possible courses of action to be taken against Charles Taylor are being debated .
What can the Commission do in the meantime ?
The meeting will consider what is the best way to deal with these various topics .
In the meantime , you ask what we are able to do .
The final subject you raised with me was the subject of Pakistan .
That , then , is what the Commission is doing to improve the human rights situation .
Situation in Chechnya
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution :
You are committing genocide .
But you won ' t succeed .
Because we shall simply outstrip you in population growth . '
The majority of them were boys , claimed the Chechen woman .
' And they will all join the partisans later , ' she concluded .
The fierce , belligerent indictment of these Chechen refugees , can be put in an historical and political context .
Remember the horrors that Stalin inflicted on the Chechen people in the 1940s .
Such a destructive cry of despair demands a serious political answer .
Gratifyingly , Boris Nemtsov promises to devote his energies to this .
He is also a doctor and a surgeon .
We should have done so a long time ago , but we have finally got round to it today .
I believe that his eyewitness account is particularly important .
Ladies and gentlemen , Chechnya is a source of shame to us and to Europe .
I believe that the European Union and the Commission have an important role to play .
Mr Poul Nielson ' s behaviour is unacceptable , appalling even .
This , however , was done in spite of exhortations to the contrary by human rights organisations .
The analysis delivered by the Human Rights Watch on the situation in Chechnya is very alarming .
I was in the Baltic States at that time too .
He took this stance in Estonia and Latvia in particular .
The deceit is partly the product of official government propaganda in Moscow .
The self-deception is happening here .
It consists in a refusal to register what is actually happening in Chechnya .
It is not a matter of the occasional atrocity but of systematic genocide .
This is systematic genocide of the Chechen people for the sake of energy resources and geostrategic interests .
If human rights are not respected , the partnership cannot function .
The first requirement is intensive dialogue .
Sweeping condemnations , however , are unhelpful .
In my opinion , both components of this strategy offer scope for further development .
As far as Chechnya is concerned , however , I am worried .
It may well be that we cannot do anything about it .
We condemn the brutalisation which we are seeing and which offers unpleasant reminders of the past .
We ought to take account , however , of a number of recent developments .
Mr Kadirov ' s former provisional Chechen administration has become permanent .
Control of the security forces is now in civilian hands .
A substantial reduction in the troops stationed in Chechnya is planned .
Despite these hoped-for improvements , the present situation is indeed still causing great concern .
Some essential steps have been taken in the judicial area .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution :
Earthquake in India
Mr President , I think that the tragedy unfolding in India demanded some response from the European Parliament .
I have only one other brief point to mention to my fellow Members .
I tabled an amendment to withdraw this paragraph .
I hope that my fellow Members will adopt this amendment .
What fine examples of humanity and solidarity in an increasingly unfeeling world .
Help is flooding in .
The damage to property alone amounts to over EUR 3 billion .
And what actions have the Indians themselves taken ?
The authorities have acted quickly despite a series of aftershocks .
We should applaud the efforts of our Indian friends .
Floods in Portugal
A reallocation of appropriations that have already been earmarked is not enough .
I repeat that what is needed is exceptional aid .
The Portuguese authorities and the civil defence forces have made huge efforts to remedy the situation .
I should also like to express my solidarity with the victims .
It is our duty to prove that Europe is not only a generous idea but also an efficient organisation .
There are , however , two fundamental issues that are worth recalling .
The first , broader issue is that of environmental protection and climate change .
The second issue concerns my country , Portugal .
They have caused a genuine disaster .
The Commission has now announced its decision to provide a further EUR 10 million .
There is no other room for manoeuvre within the Budget .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate on items on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed .
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
( The sitting was suspended at 5.15 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m. )
Stability plans in Ireland and France
It is imperative that economic policy in this European domestic market is drawn up in accordance with common guidelines .
Ireland achieves surpluses .
In this respect clearly something must be done .
The question is , however , who shall take the action ?
We must work towards ensuring that this responsibility is set out quite clearly .
A clear division of tasks is now emerging within the European Union .
The European Union , is therefore responsible for competition and currency stability .
The same applies to social security systems and education .
Just imagine a different situation .
Imagine that the inflation rate in Germany stands at 6 or 7 % .
I do not wish to raise this at the level of the European Union .
EUR 726 million in supplementary funds followed , funds that were also pumped into the Irish economy .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Is overheating important in terms of a balanced overall picture ?
We are talking about general , overall positions .
Overheating of the Irish economy is not a new problem .
It dates back to 1998 and had already been revealed in the broad economic guidelines .
It was also revealed in 1999 and again in 2000 .
What are , so to speak , the contents of the 2001 budget ?
The former believes that the figures we have calculated show an additional 0.3 % increase .
That is why , in the recommendation , we effectively acknowledge this situation and refer to 0.5 % .
In 2001 , that figure has risen to 5.4 % .
Firstly , can we treat the Member States of the European Union unequally ?
That is something we can discuss .
The figure will vary depending upon the methodologies we use .
Thank you , Commissioner Solbes Mira .
An opinion , Commissioner , rather than a recommendation .
Was a recommendation an even-handed and proportionate response ?
And the same applies elsewhere , particularly in the United Kingdom .
This latest episode does not help .
There are occasions when " a one size fits all " economic model does not fit .
Time does not allow me to run the numbers of Irish economic success .
I have no doubt my colleagues coming after me will do so .
Madam President , I do not take the same approach as my colleague , Mrs Doyle .
The Irish Government 's response to the European Commission and to Ecofin has been arrogant and reckless .
I deplore the stance taken by the Irish Government .
I believe that its position is being driven by the growing Eurosceptism in the two minority government parties .
Such a step would be a gross overreaction as well as being illegal .
The Commissioner has dealt to some extent with some aspects of that case .
That really is a peculiar observation to make .
Ireland ' s economy is prospering . Last year , growth increased by 10 per cent .
Unemployment is less than 4 per cent , and the country also has a genuine budget surplus .
The Netherlands now has higher inflation .
Ireland accounts for only 1 per cent of the EU ' s total GDP .
In more general terms , as soon as a country has accepted ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
On the other hand , I denounce the underlying attitude .
We have a budget surplus of nearly 5 % of our gross domestic product .
Our debt / GDP ratio is only 39 % .
I will give to the Commissioner a list of figures to put it into context .
Ireland 's GDP in 1991 was IEP29 billion .
It is now 10 years later IEP80 billion .
In 1991 we had to borrow IEP760 million to keep public services going .
Today we have a budget surplus .
In 1991 , 1.15 million people were in our workforce .
Today we have 1.67 million .
Bullyboy tactics of this sort are hardly the ingredients to build closer economic cooperation or coordination .
Coercion and coordination are two diametrically opposed political and human theories .
The EU will not prosper into the future if confrontation is the order of the day .
In conclusion , the holding of this debate on this occasion is very welcome .
But on closer inspection it is nevertheless correct .
Your predecessor , Mr De Silguy , simply refused to listen .
The ECB also expressed itself in disturbing terms on the subject in its monthly report for July 2000 .
If policy continues unchanged the burden of pension contribution will go through the roof in most Member States .
There is a financial time bomb ticking away .
Meanwhile the Commissioner is still not speaking unambiguously .
On this point Ireland has everything well under control .
It would be opportunistic to conceal this .
Under these circumstances , why demand restrictive measures which might have a harmful effect on Ireland ?
Therefore , adjustments through markets are replaced by centralised , administrative adjustments .
We do not believe that this is the case .
There is still one question that has not yet been resolved .
I have no pat answer to this question .
The process of constraint is , therefore , far from over .
To take the first point : you do not have the right to grow .
Mr Wurtz is telling us that we must have the right to spend .
I would point out to you , Mr Wurtz , that that is not the case in Ireland .
Ireland does not spend excessively .
It has strong growth precisely because of the fact that its spending is not excessive .
Yet , I note that France patently does not respect its commitments .
France had undertaken to reduce its public spending and to make tax cuts .
This imbalance has been upset .
Imagine that they had to do this next year .
I do not think that would be possible .
As a consequence , economic policy coordination has not yet been achieved .
I would , therefore , like to congratulate the Commission once again for having adopted this resolution .
Of course it does not , but you must go back to Article 99 ( 4 ) .
This is certainly the current scenario .
I do not believe so and I therefore welcome the decision taken by the Commission on Monday .
Are things going so badly with the Irish economy then ?
Can we really not trust the Irish ?
Not at all .
On the contrary , Ireland is doing well , as has already been mentioned by many speakers .
But all in all it is not strange that the Irish should feel harshly treated .
However , much greater risks lie in wait .
What we wonder is whether the Council of Ministers will administer a public reprimand here too .
Nevertheless it is a programme that has been negotiated with the social partners .
This is an aspect of Irish inflation which has been completely ignored by the European Commission .
This is absolute political stupidity to say the least .
Since 1994 the cumulative increase in employment has been 39 per cent .
I believe the Commission is deliberately trying to interfere in a field beyond its competence .
We must not let this happen .
We will not and cannot tolerate this continuing .
I want to thank Parliament for debating this issue .
And we had to accept the press releases from the propagandists when it was all over .
That was important .
Another thing that is exaggerated is the transfers of money .
So the people who say that Ireland has grown on handouts from Europe are exaggerating .
What disappoints me about all this is the shock expressed by the Irish finance minister .
He was told this by the Irish Economic and Social Research Institute , just as the Commission told him .
He was told it by the Irish employers ' association .
He was told it by the central banks .
In that sense , there is no such thing as sovereignty for a small , open economy like Ireland .
The minister is reputed to be a sportsman .
A sportsman should have obeyed the referee when he blew the whistle when somebody broke the rules .
This does not necessarily affect the stability of the dollar , however .
I agree , which precisely raises the question : " Why bother ? "
I accept that , as a Commission , you have the right to do what you did .
As Guardian of the Treaty , you have the duty to act , if you believe that is correct .
I accept that Ecofin endorsed the judgment of the Commission .
I believe it was the wrong judgment in the context of such an important precedent-setting example .
I believe the Irish response was the wrong response because it was too petulant .
Two wrongs do not make a right .
The tax change will lower wage expectations and therefore inflationary expectations .
As I see it , there are good reasons for supporting the Ecofin Council ' s recommendation .
Now , things are beginning to go well for Europe again .
No-one begrudges Ireland its fantastic growth .
Why , then , can Ireland not be allowed to go its own way ?
Just look , they say .
If we take part in EMU , we shall lose our economic independence .
The EU will even obtain power over our taxes .
I think that propaganda of that kind is nonsense .
Madam President , I should like to thank all the speakers for their opinions .
Firstly , we are not judging Ireland against any other country .
Those are policy matters to be decided upon at national level .
That is the situation , and these are the facts we are judging .
On that basis , we can talk about what we are , or are not , to do .
In contrast to what some believe , it is obviously not a position of the Commission .
We are talking about consistency with the model we had duly established .
Reference was made to a greater degree of understanding .
Reference was made to the lack of diplomacy on the part of the Commission .
Obviously , it may be thought that the best pupil in the class is being punished .
As I have said , it is not a case of our imposing sanctions .
And this is not inconsistent with good behaviour in terms of growth and inflation .
We could talk in much more detail .
Mr Bradbourn intimated that not enough data had been provided .
There has been discussion about whether the censure of Ireland is or is not justified .
In my opinion , it is justified .
If it were not , this proposal would not have been made .
It is true that nominal inflation has gone down in the last two months in Ireland .
Is our approach wrong ?
The Commission presented the matter to the Group of Euro Countries and to the Economic and Financial Affairs Council .
The decision was not approved by chance .
In my opinion , the Commission did what it had to do .
I would again emphasise the significance of the term , ' recommendation ' .
Thank you , Commissioner Solbes Mira .
The debate is closed .
Mr President , as you will see there are very few people here .
The situation was the same last month .
The next item is the vote on the urgent resolutions .
Before the vote on the resolution on religious freedom in China
This is exactly the procedure scheduled , Mr Wurtz .
I did not suggest starting earlier on a Monday .
That was my suggestion .
That was the last statement of this sitting as we have reached the end of the agenda .
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
( The sitting was closed at 7 p.m. )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday , 15 February 2001 .
Statement by the President
I now ask you to please stand and observe a minute ' s silence .
( The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence )
Madam President , this is not really an objection .
You are right , Mr Gollnisch , that is not an objection to the agenda .
So , shall we agree that the agenda has been finalised ?
The agenda is thus adopted .
Thank you very much , Madam President .
I await your explanation .
I would also ask President Prodi , who is present , and the Council to give us theirs .
Mr Barón Crespo , it is perfectly clear .
We have been working hard since that Conference of Presidents .
I considered that I could not single-handedly take the decision to sign a common letter of this kind .
Mr Prodi will perhaps clarify matters .
It is true that I , at any rate , have not received any invitation to attend .
I did not know anything about the debate or the invitation .
( Applause and laughter )
Mr Barón Crespo , how delightful !
Thank you , Mrs Karamanou .
Mr Medina Ortega , I shall give you all the details necessary .
However , the request to which you have referred raised a very serious problem .
The case of Portugal is exceptional ; requests from that country may be addressed directly by the judicial authority .
In this instance , the request was received directly from the Supreme Court .
I have not , to date , received any response .
I now understand better why I have not received a response .
Madam President , I simply say this to illustrate the legal complexity of the affair .
There is only one precedent in my country , which dates from 1991 .
We must , consequently , opt to postpone the ten requests for procedural motions until 4 p.m.
I think this is a reasonable decision .
( Parliament gave its assent )
Commission reform : human resources
I shall immediately give the floor to the Commission President , Mr Romano Prodi .
There had not been a complete reorganisation for decades .
A large-scale programme of investment in training activities will be an essential complement to the achievement of these objectives .
This is an ongoing task and it is called " The Future of Europe " .
We will return to those details on future occasions .
I thank them and I pay tribute to them .
Their ability and willingness to adapt to change is truly worthy of praise .
It certainly contradicts the crude caricatures of the Eurocrat .
These proposals are all available to the House .
I will , therefore , briefly outline the principal purposes of the comprehensive changes .
That is a radical change in established custom and practice .
We propose a five-fold increase in the budget available for training over the next five years .
We will fulfil that commitment .
The savings on allowances that are no longer justified will make other investments possible .
This affects Parliament in respect of all the areas I have just mentioned .
That hope has been fully realised .
I hope our partnership will continue .
Therefore it is very important that he be here .
I agree with that even more strongly now than I did then .
We can then embark upon the changes probably by the end of this year .
Others , however , must be submitted as formal legal proposals to this House and to the Council .
That is understood amongst the staff .
That in some respects is an optimistic scenario but we certainly will make every honest endeavour to achieve that .
I have encountered no sour attitudes .
I have encountered some good arguments and we are always ready to engage in those .
I should like to address two problems .
That does not signify a reluctance to make change .
They need clear guidance .
I hope that the House will continue to give its support to this process of externalisation .
Commissioner , thank you for clarifying those points on your reform plans .
I should like , therefore , to ask three questions .
How do you think it will be possible for everyone to manage ?
What plans do you have in this respect ?
So why is it that this reform is so problematic ?
In order to be brief I will simply say that the Committee of Independent Experts made over 90 recommendations .
Madam President , I thank the Commission for what it has told us .
In addition you also said that you wish to introduce salary improvements .
Can you tell us exactly what salary improvements you have in mind ?
However , over the years obviously transfers have become extremely easy .
That has changed somewhat .
I hope that custom will also be emulated .
They are not .
They are not good news for staff who persistently under-perform .
They are not good news for staff who refuse to acquire new skills .
They are not good news , in other words , for a small minority of Community officials .
They are excellent news for all other staff .
That is an excellent answer with which to close this debate .
( Protests from Mr Bigliardo )
I think it was the very least I could do .
I regret that .
And can I have your assurance that I will be able to do so on that occasion ?
In Strasbourg , Mr Howitt !
This is an unbearable situation .
Mr Poettering , you were there with Mr Berlusconi .
You were at this meeting as a special witness .
Do you believe , Mr Poettering , that this aggressive policy will bring peace to the Basque country ?
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr Korakas , we are going to discuss this matter tomorrow .
That is also a possible solution !
In any case , I endorse the hard line taken in your response .
Somebody is responsible , either Parliament or the Spanish Government .
How long are we going to put up with this indignity , Mr President ?
I had two points .
The first concerned the bombings in Iraq .
The second point concerns Moldavia .
Allow me to read it so that I can call on Parliament to take a stand ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
This is not a point of order !
There is nothing I would like more than to have an influence on the Italian electoral process .
I congratulate you .
I believed that the democratic parties had the legitimate concern of preparing for democratic elections .
The accusation of electioneering applies to autocratic leaders , not to democratic leaders .
I must say that Mr Berlusconi is electioneering in Spain at this very time .
( The President cut the speaker off )
The plenary sitting would not appear to be the most appropriate place to do this .
I would like , once again , to thank Mrs Napoletano for her statement .
Draft SAB 1 / 2001
There are several aspects to this Supplementary and Amending Budget .
This will then give rise to what are really only virtual savings of EUR 245 million .
My initial reaction was to say no to the draft as well .
And that really is not an easy task .
It is the proverbial drop in the ocean .
But these times are well and truly over .
Today , there is a surplus - a glut - in all the key markets .
This intensification has a significant environmental impact and marginalises less productive locations .
We have to break away from this system .
We cannot merely continue to treat its symptoms : we have to find a cure .
By its very nature , the system simply creates more and more problems .
So let us use this latest crisis as a chance to overhaul our common agricultural policy .
And the sooner we set about correcting the problem , the better .
Ladies and gentlemen , two million older cattle are slaughtered every year in Europe .
This is business as usual in other words .
But as a rule , these animals end up on the dinner table , not in an incineration plant .
However , I think it is a little far-fetched to talk about ethics .
Especially when there is talk of a ' Herod premium ' in relation to a calf slaughter programme .
He killed people , not animals .
There is a difference between humans and animals .
Let us not forget that .
Amendment No 1 is included in the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture .
We are now concerned with the budget amendment before us .
The space within the existing budget will be used and the Financial Perspective remains intact .
That will no longer be the case in the near future .
The expenditure ceiling will soon be in sight .
So the Community has a responsibility to play its part in overcoming this crisis as well .
That will not enhance our credibility .
An answer must be found to the loss of consumer confidence .
The Member States must finally do their homework more promptly than in the past .
We must put an end to this situation .
Some of what is happening goes beyond what is acceptable .
The Heads of State and Government must find an answer to this problem .
And the question is , do we really want to overcome this crisis ?
Mr President , in my view this debate is taking place in an unreal atmosphere .
This budget will , in any case , not be adequate to confront all these calamities .
If we approve this budget , there will not be the slightest leeway left in the 2001 budget .
Is that sensible ?
In the view of my group it is not .
We believe extra leeway should be created for the months ahead .
What has the Commission done on this point ?
Is it possible to insure ourselves in future against these kinds of calamities ?
Is a levy on meat required for an emergency fund ?
Intervention buying alone would have a budgetary cost of EUR 3 billion .
One month later , consumption has fallen by 27 % and exports have halved .
We do not believe in making things worse in order to further our own ends .
We shall therefore vote in favour of this budget as an emergency measure .
We cannot , however , leave it at that .
The European Union must see its responsibilities through to the end .
I believe that such issues are certainly worth several EUR billion .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , have the Community institutions been infected by the prion ?
But then what will we do ?
Once the SAB is adopted , there will be a margin of approximately EUR 500 million .
We know that huge savings can be made on some of the budget lines .
If this goes ahead , we will have to bear all the consequences of any such renationalisation .
Seventy per cent of the supplementary budget is to be used to pay for the incineration campaign .
It thus shores up the factory farming structures which have contributed to the crisis .
We will lose all credibility with the honest and blameless European farmers if we vote for this supplementary budget .
But unlike Mrs Haug , I am not prepared to vote in favour of this supplementary budget .
And thirdly , what must we do in the long-term ?
Please , let us keep to this .
I cannot let that pass .
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , that applies to you too , since you belong to this party as well .
In the short term , we must take every possible measure to restore stability .
Ultimately , that is the only way to identify appropriate solutions .
I hope others can learn from our experiences and maybe our mistakes as well .
For these reasons I am against the rapporteur ' s recommendation .
Mr President , the Supplementary and Amending Budget makes pitiful reading .
This is probably mostly wishful thinking .
Consumption has dropped in many of the large countries , which is reflected in increased stocks .
Within the framework of the current Financial Perspective , there is no longer any scope for doing this .
They used the legally approved feed in good faith , although it turned out to be toxic .
I am in favour of dividing the costs in half .
They are simply part of normal business and we should not be perturbed by the amount of money involved .
The real question is what it is used for and why it is necessary .
We in Europe will then feature in pictures all over the world which show the slaughtering campaigns and destruction .
That was Mrs Schreyer 's proposal .
In other words , it depends on how we spend the money .
( The President cut the speaker off )
However , this disease affecting livestock in Europe is not the result of a curse .
Cows have gone mad because they have been given a dose of politics .
At this point , we may need to have the courage to confront European opinion head on .
Europe is guilty .
Europe must make amends .
The European Union does not actually levy taxes .
Mr President , I endorse the Haug report and congratulate the rapporteur .
I nevertheless feel that the following observations need to be made about this proposal :
Firstly , the EUR 971 million that have now been made available are necessary but they are not sufficient .
In any event , we will see .
The sensitivity of the situation calls for rapid , full answers .
Let us not , therefore , allow this climate of crisis to continue .
This issue needs , as it has needed in the past , to come off the agenda .
These factors would , in fact , condemn the reform from the outset .
In this way , the legitimate interest of Europe ' s citizens will be respected .
I agree with the Commissioner on the need to rebalance the market .
I would urge the Commission again to examine the possibilities and its policy in relation to food aid .
I caution against panic measures in relation to the long-term future of Europe ' s beef industry .
I should just like to make , as would the Members of my group , a few comments .
You should , therefore , acknowledge that we have been more cautious and careful than you have .
Today , our house is on fire .
We must , therefore , do everything we can to put this fire out .
That is not all , however .
That is not the problem that we face .
Commissioner , Mr President , that is all I wanted to say .
You have our full support .
The second point is the splitting of the costs between the Member States and the Union .
One of the reasons is that BSE is only the latest development .
Overall , I think the Commission ' s proposal is a good one .
It is dramatic , but it is nonetheless sensible and balanced .
Above all , it is necessary .
The Commission also talks about an overhaul of the common agricultural policy in 2002 .
I think it ought to be possible to begin this work no later than this year .
We cannot go on producing for meat mountains . Instead , producing for consumption is what it is about .
That means that more will need to be done .
More than 40 per cent of the EU ' s budgetary resources now already go on agriculture .
It is impossible to go beyond that level .
Secondly , another form of cost distribution is , in actual fact , only fair .
We have for a long time been familiar with the problems and the reasons for these .
We accept that we are dealing here with a genuine budgetary emergency .
And this response must be first and foremost a financial one .
I believe that that would be a truly European response .
We must do this in a calm way .
It is not as simple as that .
It is about intensive production and this does not always take place on the large farms .
We must also look at food imports from outside the European Union .
Consumption can return , and it has returned in the UK .
Mr President , I support the supplementary budget and recognise the need for it .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
In any case , the crisis is here and it will cost the European taxpayers .
It is actually a relatively small amount .
The budget of the European Union is a little over 1 % .
So the European Union takes 1 % , of which in the past , agriculture took 80 % .
We should remember that .
So what are the solutions to the problem ?
Is it only about quantity ? To what extent is quality also an issue ?
We are now securing the funding for the decisions which were adopted back in December .
This represents an increase of more than 50 % on last year 's figure .
It is important to make this clear .
But the money will go to the farmers , as partial compensation for their revenue shortfall .
It is a sad day for agricultural policy , and a sad day for the taxpayer .
But I must also point out that there really is no alternative .
Let me say a few words about food aid as a possible alternative .
These are factors which have to be considered .
Of course , we can , and must , discuss whether further measures are necessary .
But we have to agree something at this stage .
When we come to debate the second package of measures , we can examine the issue of crisis management .
The crisis in the United Kingdom has already reached major proportions .
We must be prepared for this possibility .
Mr President , allow me to make a brief remark .
Thank you very much , Mr Mulder .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
You will be aware that the first outbreak was confirmed on 20 February in the evening .
It also provided for a review of the decision of the Standing Veterinary Committee on 27 February .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
Unfortunately , the number of outbreaks has continued to increase and currently amounts to 22 .
There are a number of worrying aspects to this outbreak which I should enumerate for you .
This ban has been prolonged for another fortnight .
The situation was reviewed at a meeting of the Standing Veterinary Committee yesterday .
Our current approach is focused on stamping out the disease .
Clearly we have to be very concerned with the present situation .
My firm intention is to maintain that success .
I would now like to hear your views on the current situation .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Byrne .
The next item is Question Time .
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his measured statement this afternoon .
He also mentioned vaccination as a further possibility .
Can he say anything about the time scale for vaccination ?
Mr President , Commissioner , I have two questions .
The current precautions in connection with BSE have been eclipsed by the dangerous foot-and-mouth epidemic .
How are the severe restrictions on movements of animals being enforced , Commissioner ?
How secure is the situation in the European Community regarding labelling obligations ?
You said that culling and the travelling ban are currently the main objectives .
Are you well prepared ?
Thank you , Commissioner , for coming today .
I also echo Mr Adam ' s feelings .
On that note , I would like to say how worried we are .
Have we finally sorted the problem of infected sheep ?
We are not considering it as an option except as a last resort .
It would entail huge costs and potential loss of trade .
It would be an enormous decision with many implications .
There is also EU legislation .
Susceptible animals have been identified and are under active surveillance .
Indeed , as you are probably aware , many animals have already been destroyed .
Mr Sturdy then asked me two questions .
Firstly , has the UK Government applied for any funding ?
The answer to that question is no .
Could the Commissioner give us any update on that ?
Hopefully , again it is only a suspect case and will remain so .
We should at least exercise some caution here .
Not that I am tempting providence , Commissioner , but the risk does exist .
The Commissioner said that no funding from the EU had been requested for this at the moment .
I thought it was perhaps just regions of particular countries .
Could he be a little more specific on that ?
Obviously , there is active surveillance of the situation .
Authorities are keeping the farm under close surveillance and it has been closed .
I will have clarification of that situation later in the day .
Nothing has been brought to my attention in relation to that .
Focus must be on the restriction of live animals and then also on animal products .
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf asked me about compensation .
I understand that approximately EUR 50 million a year are available for this .
Mrs Lynne asked me about the differentiation in designation between regions and countries .
If a region is incapable of providing that certification , then the product cannot be exported .
We have been remarkably free in the European Union from foot-and-mouth disease over that period of time .
In that respect , what progress has been made by your directorate and the Health and Consumer Protection Directorate ?
That is my first question .
Therefore , is the fact that they are local not a solution to the unfolding crises ?
Your views on this please .
Mr President , with regard to Mrs Auroi ' s question on fraud in the Member States .
We must be careful not to look for magic solutions and make knee-jerk reactions as to causes .
There are 30 million doses of vaccine in the European Union .
In other words , it is not understood to be a public health problem .
Mr Cunha then asked me about countries where exports had taken place .
I am sure that information is available in my DG .
The UK has kept my DG fully up-to-date on all developments .
Mr President , I have three questions .
Can you say anything about this ?
Will that continue to occur in future with the new regulations ?
Is that true ?
What is the percentage that cannot be traced ?
That sounds like a hot potato for you , Commissioner .
The question from Mr Maat concerns different levels of performance in different Member States .
I strongly believe that Member States fully understand the seriousness of the situation .
Movements have been restricted .
With regard to that , traceability has worked very well but there are limitations .
We cannot ensure individual identification of sheep and pigs in all instances .
Mr Cushnahan then asked me about whether there should be criminal prosecution in the event of fraud .
That is an issue that Member States are responsible for themselves .
It is not the duty of the Commission to require Member States to initiate such criminal prosecutions .
You say that it has to be licensed .
I think there are problems with this licensing .
When cases break out in these countries there is a time lag .
All this needs to be tightened up .
But it is at a time like this that you realise how mobile animals are .
You need only look at the map and see the distances they travel .
Mrs Doyle referred to the scare in my home county in my constituency in Northern Ireland .
At this time those animals have all been tested .
I have been in touch with my local veterinary department .
I should like to ask the Commissioner one question . He referred to intensive farming .
Would he not agree with me that this is the case ?
On travel , I confirm that this particular disease can be wind-borne .
I do not believe that particular issue is a significantly relevant issue to this particular outbreak of the disease .
That concludes this item .
The next item is the joint debate on the following three reports :
Lastly , environmental impact .
It would be an important addition to citizens ' rights .
As much as EUR 170 billion are estimated to have gone into radio spectrum auctions .
Apart from anything else , the timing was unfortunate .
The result is more problems , the stock market value of many operators having collapsed .
The framework directive is a move towards the regulation of all telecommunications networks and services .
With it the number of provisions will fall to less than a third of what there are at present .
Genuine competition has been prevented through many forms of trickery .
At the same time , I propose an increase in transparency .
Another essential sector is the definition of significant market player .
We in the committee have broadened the notion in the light of recent developments .
Turning now to the authorisation directive and my report .
The purpose of the authorisation directive submitted by the Commission is to remedy this .
A couple of comments on the content of the proposed directive .
They will merely be required to meet the conditions set out in general licences .
The proposal also provides that , in future , service providers will no longer have to furnish comprehensive information .
I should like to address a problem which currently hits operators hard in practice .
Time and again they come up against serious difficulties as regards the granting of rights of way .
This makes it even more difficult to develop an infrastructure - unnecessarily so .
Laying long telecommunications cables is an expensive business .
They have to obtain planning permission .
Finally , the subject of administrative charges is another crucial point .
The directive provides here for the Member States to publish reports in order to make the costs transparent .
That concludes the introduction to my report .
I should now like to take the liberty of highlighting an important aspect of Mr Paasilinna 's report .
The Commission would also decide in future if and on what frequencies radio communications can be broadcast .
The liberalisation of the telecommunications markets has been a real success story .
Consumers today have a choice of service providers and telephone charges have fallen rapidly .
This would only complicate and slow down the decision-making process .
I have re-tabled the proposed amendment which Parliament will be voting on tomorrow .
I refer to Amendment No 78 .
I ask you to support this amendment and thank you for listening .
Telecommunications are changing our lives at a fast pace .
The Commission ' s proposal focuses mainly on competition and a level playing field .
It is therefore a purely commercial approach and focuses on the infrastructure .
What I feel is missing is the proviso that cultural diversity and plurality should be guaranteed .
Well , Mr President , that will in fact be much too late .
It is to be welcomed that the rapporteur has taken this line of reasoning into account .
That a horizontal approach has been chosen is logical and to be welcomed .
In other words , we must ensure that networks and services of general interest are adequately disseminated .
The market can do a great deal , but it cannot do everything .
From this point of view , the principle of coordination before harmonisation applies .
I believe that this is exemplary in this House .
It would be very good if a plan of action could be agreed there .
I should like to mention here a number of elements , which strike me as important in this context .
A well-known example is that of the international roaming tariffs .
We must indeed work towards a Europe-wide electronic communications market .
Fifteen separate national electronic communications markets cannot work .
That is the priority .
I would also like to congratulate all three rapporteurs for simplifying reports on a very complicated area .
On the contrary , the new legal framework will serve to enhance competition in this sector .
However , rules with a significant effect should not be based on a short-term vision .
Nevertheless there is still no single internal telecom market .
My second point , Mr President , concerns licences for radio frequencies .
Think , for example of the UMTS auctions .
I believe there is also a job here for Commissioner Monti .
Mr van Velzen has already pointed this out .
It also concurs with the agreements at the Lisbon Summit .
Auctions should be avoided wherever possible .
In addition , the proceeds of the wavebands should never be seen as a stealth tax .
So the point is not if they should be privatised , it is merely how .
The European Greens have a clear attitude towards liberalisation .
A great deal has been said about technological neutrality .
Technological neutrality may well exist at a purely legislative level .
But at a social level , technology is never neutral .
So where does this take us ?
And that means fair access .
This communication must be free .
Mr President , the telecommunications companies proclaim that competition should regulate the market .
But can we trust in competition as a regulator of the market ?
No , we cannot .
We live in a jungle , where the laws of the jungle determine prices .
I would like to think so , although it is not certain it would have .
He is calling for a thorough investigation into the financial effects of auctions .
Our group supports this .
Members have already mentioned the costs and the tariffs that are associated with the different structures .
We want to work out a best practice method together with the Commission .
Above all - and this is very important - we also want to use SLIM .
I want to try and avoid that .
But I too should like to highlight two or three points .
There are certainly material arguments here which go beyond political bounds .
In this respect , my maxim still holds : less regulation may be much better regulation .
I think that , in concentrating on the directives being debated today , we have succeeded in doing this .
I must , of course , pour just a little cold water on one point .
Mr van Velzen was one of many who said that our aim is a great pan-European market .
I concur .
Despite the efforts some have made , it is another regulatory nightmare .
We have had difficulty in reconciling the texts .
We have not made the Commission ' s task easier .
We have not done that with the amendments that we have made .
We are actually finding excuses for regulating .
That is something that we need to reflect on between now and the second reading .
We are spending far too much time here thinking about transitory issues of roaming .
I remain entirely unconvinced that the sort of interventionist approach we have taken here is right .
The rapporteurs have done excellent work here .
What are we actually about here ?
What we are about is creating new rules to look at who can play and on what terms .
We are looking for a genuine pan-European single market .
These are important steps in that direction .
Second point : NRAs .
I am not sure if you have the balance right .
I just leave that as a question mark .
However , in a capitalist society , the only thing that matters is to maximise profits .
The next step will be to market the very air that we breathe .
This being the case , the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the directives .
Passions in one way or another will give rise yet to a colourful debate .
The definition of a dominant market position has been the main area of special attention .
We must be able to intervene in roaming charges that are currently distorting competition .
The workings of an open internal market must be respected .
There must be further wide-ranging discussion with regard to the position of virtual operators .
We are in a bipartite situation and we are hardly going to find a solution to it right away .
Of that there can be no question ; we have been discussing this point for years .
I would like to support , in particular , Amendments Nos 13 and 16 , 19 and 20 .
These were amendments to help to ensure that disabled users benefit equally from electronic communications .
That is meaningless without these amendments .
The menu on television or mobile phones should have an audio alternative .
It is a small change .
I would first like to thank the three rapporteurs , Mr Brunetta , Mr Paasilinna and Mrs Niebler .
These are not just any reports .
Firstly they cover three directives which will be central to the future competence of the European economy .
I apologise for this and will try to concentrate on the very core issues .
This legislation will ensure a level playing field for operators across the single market .
The second key element is the SMP definition .
It is the Commission ' s view that the definition in Amendment No 56 is too wide .
We also believe that this definition could undermine consistency of regulatory action .
Thus I regret that the Commission cannot support Amendments Nos 72 to 74 .
The Commission cannot support Amendments Nos 39 and 40 .
However , there is a field where all service providers have been subject to access regulation .
This is the conditional access for digital television .
This regime has worked well .
Moving away from the regime of Directive 95 / 48 would require wide consultation and careful analysis .
Therefore , the Commission does not support Amendment No 46 .
The move from individual licences to general authorisations will greatly improve market access and cut red tape .
In many respects , Mrs Niebler ' s report strengthens and improves the Commission ' s proposals .
The idea of annual instalments for the payment of one-off amounts is a possible solution .
We will , however , have to look carefully at the exact wording .
Maintaining turnover as a key for dividing administrative charges seems the most appropriate way .
We know the facts .
The current legislation leaves Member States the choice of licensing methods and licensing conditions .
We know that it has led to a wide divergence in the sums paid for the licences .
The single market is fragmented .
We have to safeguard Europe ' s lead in mobile communications .
More than ever we need to work together .
We have to see that new Internet protocol version 6 will be rolled out swiftly .
Together we must guarantee that Europe ' s lead in mobile communication will be safeguarded .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
( The sitting was suspended at 7.55 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
Effects of globalisation on Mediterranean women immigrants
Emigration is an ancient phenomenon but it has recently taken on some new characteristics .
In the majority of cases they come without sufficient information .
This lack of information is one of the most important aspects that we highlight in this report .
This means that they must be provided with greater information in their countries of origin .
They refer to the concept of ' Euro-Mediterranean citizenship ' .
Mr President , allow me to begin by congratulating Mrs Avilés Perea on her excellent report .
Of course , globalisation is not a panacea for all evils .
The situation is clearly more critical in the case of female migrants .
They are more vulnerable to abusive practices .
A broad consensus will no doubt give our demands and our actions more force .
This forum was not the result of a European Parliament initiative .
What is the purpose of this initiative ?
I therefore appeal to the rapporteur .
I would ask you sincerely to consider this option .
However , I have some misgivings , because what is the purpose of this report ?
The previous speaker made this point .
Does it contribute to the finding of work , and if so , how ?
There are also a number of shortcomings in this report .
I shall mention a few .
A second point .
It sounds very limited .
Surely it is not just a matter of cheap domestic help ?
A third point .
The report talks of Euro-Mediterranean citizenship .
Will we have Euro-ACP citizenship or Euro-Mercosur citizenship ?
Because the European Union has entered into treaties with these countries too .
And what kind of status will such a citizen have ?
A higher status , or a lower one ?
Such a measure might well lead to discrimination .
And I could go on .
Humanly speaking , that is the wrong end at which to begin .
I hope that those who have spoken on the subject will be able to come to an agreement .
We therefore welcome these two points .
However , I am much less enthusiastic about the proposal regarding a new observatory .
In my opinion , the experiment of European Union observatories should be fully analysed .
The same may be said of the issue of citizenship .
That is what I wanted to say on the report under consideration .
However , I would express my concern essentially on two points .
The way in which they do so depends mainly on their constitution and political institutions .
The main aspects are correctly presented in the report .
The report considers that all is not well here .
The report should cover these tasks more amply .
This is important to bear in mind when we discuss the problems of immigrant women in Europe .
The Commission considers that zero immigration is neither realistic nor justified .
In this process we have to prevent gender-based discriminatory practices .
The promotion of proactive gender equality is very necessary .
The Treaty of Amsterdam explicitly includes gender equality among the objectives of the European Community .
This applies to our domestic , as well as external , policies .
The trafficking in human beings is facilitated by globalisation and by modern technologies .
The traditional flow between certain Third World regions and Western destinations continues .
The Commission has taken significant steps against this violation of human rights .
Immigrant women are particularly vulnerable to discrimination and social exclusion .
Both integrate the gender perspective and the programme will support transitional activities .
This is a matter of equality .
The European Structural Funds play a major role in this process .
It is about tolerance , modernisation and improvement of the various tools of policy .
It is also about democracy and solidarity .
Equal representation is a key issue here .
Women ' s voices are still not being heard sufficiently in major policy areas .
Structural changes are required to make them more audible .
Many of these things are well-known , well-established challenges .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Nielson .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
It deserves the same accolade from the House .
It lays down the foundation for development policy for the coming decade .
Trade is the key .
I applaud much of its thinking .
We in Parliament must support its efforts .
' Everything but Arms ' is a major step forward .
Small-scale help for entrepreneurs must not be abandoned .
The Commission has laid down its six priority principles , all of which we can strongly support .
The priority within the six is also important .
However , we do not support just any development policy .
That is what Parliament approved and what we want to see .
In summary , we cannot manage this policy in the erratic way that we are doing at the moment .
Mr Gemelli ' s report is good .
Both documents are worthless if they are not applicable in practice .
All of these issues affect our everyday policy .
We therefore hope that this report bears fruit .
The answer is yes , with the proviso that communication and energy should be added to transport .
The promotion of regional cooperation should also be given new impetus .
It is better for us to do less very well than a great deal badly .
It is a question of effectiveness .
This is why the policy of the Commission and that of the Member States should complement each other .
Reducing poverty in the world is more important than increasing one ' s own wealth .
That must also be given absolute priority by our Parliament .
Liberal globalisation to promote development has admittedly been a failure .
We should reiterate , however , the basic principle of a sustainable development policy .
We must take away this fundamental ambiguity .
Where does the European Union stop having a direct interest and where does its development policy begin ?
Developing countries are obviously experiencing difficulties in protecting their interests within the international community .
However , I too doubt that it will be possible to halve the number of poor people by 2015 .
Development policy is not just altruism , it is self interest .
Combating poverty is the primary goal of the EU ' s development policy .
I therefore hope that the House will adopt those amendments also adopted by the Committee on Development and Cooperation .
Mr President , I too want to congratulate Mr Gemelli on his report .
The six priority areas listed in the Commission ' s report are well chosen .
At the same time , Parliament ' s resolution contains a number of important additional paragraphs and remarks .
I oppose that .
But gradually you can nevertheless see that a modest step forward is being taken .
The situation at this moment is definitely not a simple one .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Mr van den Berg is optimistic .
For that reason we actually consider it a good idea that a new policy is being constructed .
So there has definitely not been a success in combating poverty .
However , we must be prepared to cooperate fully with those partners that want to .
However , I should like to ask a few questions .
Why is aid not concentrated to a greater extent on the poorest countries ?
How much will the poor in those countries really benefit ?
Will we have any say in the expenditure of the European Development Fund ?
Is the Council prepared to stop intervening in concrete implementation plans ?
In fact , that applies to other policy fields too .
I am thinking of agricultural subsidies , for example .
The European Union has its own limited political priorities and responsibilities .
Such a reactive strategy does not benefit the coherence of our policy .
Information and communications technology must indeed be a major priority .
Then there is health policy .
The Commission ' s action programme on pharmaceutical drugs is commendable but inadequate .
Can I begin by being self-critical of this Parliament .
Nevertheless , there is much in this report on which the Commission should reflect .
Our objective should not be poverty reduction but poverty eradication .
The test is implementation .
I thank him for that .
We are very close to an understanding which will ensure that Parliament and Commission move forward together .
I ask him to work with us so that we can turn our mutual desires into a common commitment .
Such failure has left many countries poorer today .
The aim is to reduce substantially the poverty and misery experienced by so many .
The Gemelli report attempts to take a fresh approach , a bold approach .
Out with theory , the models which did not produce results .
How can this be ?
What are the reasons for this ?
So what is the risk now , Commissioner Nielson ?
In other words , they are twice excluded .
I have seen no sign of this .
In fact , there is a group of countries which actually are above 0.7 % .
Sweden is about 0.8 % , as is the Netherlands .
Luxembourg has just made it above 0.7 % .
So it is fine that we have the G7 .
Fortunately for development cooperation we also have the G0.7.
This is quite important , when we look around the world , that we have the availability of resources .
One big element in the complex equation of what we do is to be considered stable .
This is also part of my approach in dealing with these issues .
This is in any case a complex issue .
We can only offer to do those things in the developing countries that we know how to do .
Mr Rod also mentioned access to medicines .
I listened carefully to the different evaluations concerning how Member States finally decided on Monday .
There was very little doubt as to the Commission ' s views and its original proposal .
The Member States have now decided .
We can always discuss whether we have done our part and whether it is good enough .
But what we have done is something which the others now have to match .
Relatively speaking , this is very good at this time .
But we have become mainstream .
Getting it done will be quite a challenge but we will face up to it .
This is where we are now .
This is the core of the discussion that is still outstanding , not an issue of substantial disagreement .
We never had that before .
So it is valuable .
For the rest of the geography we are going to move from country to country applying the same rules .
Another big drama will be the actual delivery .
Highly migratory fish stocks
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
The Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries , Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna , has the floor .
I would also like to draw your attention to the Community decision-making procedure in this field .
We must change this system , Commissioner .
To have competence must mean having the financial capacity necessary to confront it .
At present , these measures are scattered throughout a number of regulations .
Of the major stocks , only skipjack is not thought to be over-exploited .
ICCAT is taking action on this , and other organisations should also be addressing this problem .
The EU must be more flexible on this question .
A single text and a single regulation require that we have a single management unit .
I only have two points I want to make .
The first concerns the very important amendment tabled by my colleague Mr Piétrasanta in committee .
Stocks of blue and white marlin are severely depleted in the Atlantic and they do need protection .
This gear helps with the live release of marlin and so can contribute to the conservation of the stocks .
After all the stocks need our help .
The second point I want to make is in relation to the financial contribution report by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna .
The Commission has offered to fund half the cost and that is sufficient .
We will be opposing one amendment , but supporting the overall report .
However , in my view , the method followed deserves no beauty prizes .
Rapporteur Varela Suanzes-Carpegna has , in my view , not understood the Nice Summit .
Cofinancing is certainly not a dirty word and does not imply a renationalisation of policy .
A cost-benefit analysis for each Member State might be a cause of embarrassment to the rapporteur .
With regard to the species described as highly migratory , the total catches have increased significantly .
Recently , a number of regional organisations have sprung up which aim to regulate the fishing of these species .
I think that this is a fundamental point .
We have included both new and existing provisions in these regulations .
I am delighted that Parliament also supports this idea .
We shall then consider your amendments in a fitting manner in this proposal .
Amendment Nos 8 and 9 concern technical measures , which we can accept .
Now to the regulation on financial support for the assignment of observers .
Hence our proposal of financial support .
Now you are calling for the Commission to bear the full cost of this observation system .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
EC / Equatorial Guinea fisheries agreement
The protocol concerns tuna only .
It is important as it will ensure the continuity of Community tuna activities in the Gulf of Guinea .
There has been an uptake of licences by French , Spanish , Portuguese and one Italian vessel .
Although these problems have now been resolved , there was not sufficient time for substantial negotiations to be undertaken .
This should also be the case with Equatorial Guinea .
As rapporteur , I can support the proposed extension of the protocol for one year .
I would urge the Commission to bear this in mind during the forthcoming negotiations .
I would like in conclusion to point out that the Council had already adopted this proposal last Monday .
Of course , this is nothing new .
This is something that all of us on the Fisheries Committee regret .
The sector too often feels abandoned as a result of the lack of a joint policy .
Ladies and gentlemen , a single musician cannot perform a symphony .
I have one specific question for Commissioner Fischler .
I presume that negotiations are already proceeding for the next agreement , as this one expires in June .
The EU is concerned about the growing use of flags of convenience .
I should therefore like to know whether the Commission would be prepared to take this fact into consideration .
Now to the question raised in connection with Cape Verde .
The Greens are voting against this agreement , as we do with all third-country agreements .
The question is in relation to flags of convenience .
Equatorial Guinea is notorious in relation to that and you did not address the question .
We need a reply .
Maybe it is too late tonight , but it is important .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
( The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m. )
He is convinced that our intervention in particular played a significant role in securing his release .
Thank you , Mr Wuermeling .
Air strikes in Iraq
The next item is the statements by the Council and Commission on air strikes in Iraq .
We also know that several countries have been critical of the actions .
At the same time , we must respect the fact that there are issues we view differently .
The Presidency has just explained the background to the recent air raids .
We have now reached an important point in our dealings with Iraq .
The sanctions which have been in place for 10 years have clearly not achieved their desired objectives .
They are perceived to be exacerbating the humanitarian condition of the Iraqi people .
This policy will have consequences beyond the present which will be borne by future generations of Iraqis .
The new US Secretary of State , Colin Powell , has said as much .
We must not lose sight of the basic objective .
The suffering of the Iraqi people is very much a concern of the European Union .
For 2001 the amount may be somewhat higher at around EUR 12 million .
The ECHO assistance is provided through international non-governmental organisations and through the appropriate UN agencies .
( Applause from the PPE Group )
The sooner he disappears , the better things will be .
The United Nations Security Council must make a clear statement on this issue .
The issue remains as to how effective the current economic sanctions are .
Politically speaking , they are ineffective .
Legally , they can be called into question .
Morally speaking , they are intolerable .
He went out into the street and saw his friend ' s body .
When he put his hands down he saw that he was dead .
He found that he was touching almost a piece of jelly .
The Iraqi soldiers had broken every single bone in that man ' s body .
We do not know what has happened to them .
We have to keep looking .
I visited Iran .
A million people were killed because of Saddam ' s assault and predatory efforts inside Iran .
Maybe 25 to 30,000 prisoners from Iran are still inside Iraqi prisons .
Let us not forget those people either .
I have been to Kurdistan .
I have seen the results of the chemical weapons .
And why ?
It is within our power to restore the marshes of Iraq .
This man is a monster .
It is not recklessness it is ruthlessness .
This man is indeed a modern Hitler .
( Applause from the centre and the right )
Let us start with the legal basis , which is extremely dubious , to say the least .
I am pleased that Commissioner Patten has already mentioned that he is in favour of changing the current regime .
We could talk at great length about this issue .
As the previous speaker has already mentioned , we should not forget Haladja .
I believe that the latest air raids on Iraq illustrate with startling clarity what is at stake .
They are in direct opposition to the principles that we stand for .
None of the UN resolutions provides for this sort of use of force .
These continued bombings have enabled Saddam to get rid of any international inspection of disarmament measures .
Today , the political affinity that existed between Mr Blair and Mr Clinton is no longer even applicable .
This can no longer be termed the ' third way ' - these actions blatantly overstep the mark .
We have already said this about the Echelon affair .
Nonetheless , at a certain point , choices have to be made .
It is impossible to be in two places at the same time .
Is this what we really want to see as we prepare for enlargement ?
Mr President , I share the view of Saddam Hussein expressed in this House .
Iraq was given technology and weapons to pursue that war .
The technology for chemical weapons flowed to Baghdad .
The Western military / industrial complex had a field day and poured its weapons into Baghdad .
That was an enormous misinterpretation by the Iraqis and they suffered the consequence .
It is estimated that 1.5 million people have died since the introduction of sanctions .
He is still there .
But all those children who have died are not .
What did they know about sanctions ?
Sanctions hurt the citizens , as has been said already here .
They do not hurt the elite of the state on which the sanctions are imposed .
The Islamic world is outraged , and rightly so , at the genocidal policies being pursued in Iraq .
It also plays into the hands of Saddam Hussein who has remained unchallenged for the past thirty years .
He is more popular among the Arab people now than ever before .
Everyone can draw their own conclusions from this .
After ten years , we have some experience of the sanctions imposed in 1991 .
Mr President , undermining one ' s own political authority is always a bad thing .
If this is done in front of a ruthless enemy , it can have disastrous implications .
And who had the last laugh ?
Saddam Hussein , of course !
Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra put a number of questions to the Council , for example concerning the sanctions .
It is there that our demands upon Iraq are stated .
That is the basis for our entire discussion .
Issues he mentioned included those relating to an international verification committee and to the currency flow .
The European Union is actively participating in that discussion .
These are difficult issues .
I believe it is important that the European Union should actively participate in that discussion .
Mr Lagendijk addresses the issue of bringing Saddam Hussein before an international tribunal .
That is , unfortunately , impossible with the current regime .
I note what Mr Lagendijk has to say about the European Parliament ' s resolutions from last autumn .
They are important .
They also serve as an important guide for subsequent actions on the part of the Council .
I believe that it is imperative to make a distinction in this regard .
I believe that we should constructively and actively participate in defining these .
This must involve using every instrument to destabilise Saddam Hussein ' s regime .
Mr President , the European Union is often divided on the issue of foreign policy .
This observation is made repeatedly and Iraq is further proof of it .
Yet , everyone in Europe is united in condemning Saddam Hussein ' s regime .
Past experience has taught us that embargoes or blockades never work .
Hospitals can no longer provide care .
The number of deaths is rising at an alarming rate .
Schools can no longer remain open .
Most of the population is illiterate .
Finding food is an achievement .
Access to information is controlled .
In short , everything is done for , apart from Saddam Hussein .
Nowadays , we can no longer make peace by waging war .
Let us put an end to the isolation instead of continuing with the blockades .
Let us move in this direction .
The Iraqi people will then be able to find the path to freedom .
I am sure that we all agree .
The problem is how to do it .
So how do we provide the democratic legitimacy when we are all involved ?
This Parliament has proposed various mechanisms for introducing this legitimacy .
It is disgraceful .
It is quite disgraceful .
People listen to us , journalists watch our every move .
It is disgraceful , having two sets of standards , two yardsticks .
Iraq is the victim of Saddam , not of the sanctions .
And all this exactly coincides with the new Anglo-American bombing .
Many in the West , including myself , think the same .
It should more properly be entitled " How can Saddam Hussein be controlled more effectively ? "
Ground targets are only engaged if there is a threat to coalition aircraft .
There is no bombing campaign against Iraq .
There is an element in this House which seeks to distort all these facts .
They are simply to restrict Saddam Hussein ' s ability to kill and terrorise his own people .
So the no-fly zones are vital in avoiding humanitarian disaster .
Yet those enforcing the no-fly zones have themselves come under constant attack .
We cannot allow the pilots who are trying to protect humanity to be themselves endangered .
That would be irresponsible , and would also be a betrayal of them .
The debate is closed .
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
Since then , meetings with organised civil society have also been taking place .
The commitment signified by these agreements with Mercosur and Chile is therefore unique .
However , we think that a number of changes need to be made .
Mr President , the two rapporteurs have already mentioned the essential points .
We do not want to wait until the round of WTO negotiations has been concluded .
This is now regrettably as dead as a doornail .
I would incidentally like to give an example of just how important this institute was in Latin America .
This then shows what a high profile we gave previously to our relations with Latin America .
Point 2 should end with the initials GATT .
I therefore only wish to highlight two points .
I would like to know what the Commission and Mr Patten ' s views on the matter are .
So this is a significant moment , Mr President , a moment not to be wasted .
From this point of view , these agreements are strategically important and deserve our protection at a political level .
We should not , therefore , create legal obstacles where they do not exist .
This has a particular bearing on economics and trade .
A last point : we must enhance and provide for the participation of civil society .
Let me first start by congratulating the rapporteurs for their excellent and very helpful reports .
The negotiations are well on track .
It was a considerable success .
Negotiating texts have been exchanged .
This has all been possible thanks to our serious commitment to these negotiations .
During the course of this year I want to accelerate these negotiations .
This critical mass should be sufficient in some areas to finish discussions .
As Parliament knows , no sector is excluded from the negotiations .
The two reports that we are discussing are both comprehensive and extremely useful .
We had a full internal debate on this two or three years ago .
Let me just make a few concrete comments as regards the specific recommendations .
First the matter of the legal base .
The final agreement will be an association agreement not a mere trade deal .
Our future strategic partnership goes well beyond trade .
I agree with this opinion .
For the time being we only have the outline of agreement .
Then labour rights . These are also an integral part of the negotiations .
They are currently being discussed in view of the fourth round in March .
We need to ensure that labour rights and greater prosperity advance hand-in-hand .
I come to greater political cooperation including security .
This was already established during the third round in Brasilia and Santiago .
Civil society was mentioned in the reports and by a number of speakers .
Transparency and accountability are essential .
Civil society should be part of the agreement .
It depends as well on the progress we achieve in future negotiating rounds with Mercosur and Chile .
We might consider this option if sufficient and substantial progress is made .
It is suggested that we should eliminate the two-phased negotiating approach .
I am afraid we are now too far into the process to turn back .
We are determined to get on with the job and make as much progress as possible .
Negotiations are in full swing .
Preparations for the next round are on track .
I hope I can count on Parliament ' s support to that end .
I am afraid I left the Chamber for about 60 seconds of her speech .
She asked whether there would be a joint interparliamentary committee .
The Commission strongly believes that there should be .
So we can give a very positive response to that important proposal .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
( The sitting was suspended until 11 a.m. )
Could I raise an issue in advance of Question Time next week .
Thank you very much .
I am calling for a review of this rule of conduct .
The Scottish , my own country ' s national dress involves wearing a dagger in your sock .
Nevertheless , I think you should raise it with the College of Quaestors .
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Lehne report ( A5-0056 / 2001 )
I believe that this condition is crucial .
Once they have arrived in the EU , they have no rights or social protection at all .
There are not even as many as 50 states which are exempt from the visa requirement .
Europe must change its attitude to immigration .
Within a few years ' time , there will be an acute labour shortage in the EU .
Haug report ( A5-0064 / 2001 )
The problems that we are experiencing would justify this unusual step .
This difference of approach does not reflect different attitudes to agricultural policy .
This view is also expressed in the report .
Those demands will now be pushed hard by Parliament , something which all we Swedish Social Democrats applaud .
We are not therefore concerned here with substantially different views of agricultural policy .
On the contrary , I feel very sympathetic towards the voting intentions of my Swedish Social Democratic colleagues .
We differ only in our view of what can be achieved by voting against this practical report .
The Financial Perspective must be revised .
I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution .
Consumers have lost their confidence in farming and it can only be restored by developing sustainable agriculture .
This would have been unacceptable to us , unacceptable to the Irish Government and unacceptable to our farming community .
The Fianna Fail MEPs reluctantly voted in favour of this proposal .
Community rules , at the present time , do not allow for a higher Community participation .
Our choice was therefore limited , however regrettable .
We voted against this paragraph .
This is a matter for the Heads of State and Government - only .
It is not on their agenda .
Finally this is a budgetary matter only .
Any discussion on the reform of the CAP will take place at the right time .
That time is not now .
Yet , that is not the most important point .
We do not .
There were many giveaway signs of Europe ' s predictable weak points .
The report addresses the consequences of the BSE crisis for the Budget .
With these reservations , we support the report .
Brunetta report ( A5-0061 / 2001 )
Why did I vote for it ?
I support the entire telecommunications package because it has many strengths .
I voted in favour of Mr Brunetta ' s report with these added clarifications .
There are many good aspects to the Brunetta report .
It ought not to be possible to use interfaces and software which tie consumers to one particular service provider .
The latter is an unduly detailed regulation .
Paasilinna report ( A5-0053 / 2001 )
So how could I not vote for this report ?
These regulations must provide consistency throughout the Community .
The NRAs will therefore have a large part to play in achieving this .
It was even thought worthwhile arranging a public hearing on this topic .
I therefore welcome the fact that this amendment has been adopted .
We have chosen to vote against Amendments 23 , 25 and 53 .
We are basically well disposed towards the European Union .
Niebler report ( A5-0062 / 2001 )
I therefore voted against Amendment 21 .
This limitation may do smaller undertakings a lot of harm .
Varela Suanzes-Carpegna reports ( A5-0047 and 0046 / 2001 )
The first report is a regulation on controls applicable to fishing .
Why does she envy him ?
Control is a very delicate and important matter .
If we pay the inspectors , we should also choose them .
Maybe some generous soul , but very few .
Piétrasanta report ( A5-0051 / 2001 )
Mr President , the report by Mr Piétrasanta concerns control of the tuna fishery .
Today , therefore , I must speak on behalf of the young tuna .
Gallagher report ( A5-0044 / 2001 )
It is still about tuna .
Instead , the EU should help Equatorial Guinea to be in position to exploit its fishing resources itself .
Avilés Perea report ( A5-0058 / 2001 )
That was not the case with this report .
Gemelli report ( A5-0059 / 2001 )
Development aid is not just due to a generosity tinged with paternalism .
Marset Campos report ( A5-0049 / 2001 )
Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra report ( A5-0050 / 2001 )
So why should we not do here what they have done in Chile ?
That concludes the explanations of vote .
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .

Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday , 1 March 2001 .
They both passed away on 3 March 2001 .

Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the sitting of 1 March have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
We are currently discussing the approval of the Minutes .
Is there something that you would like to be corrected ?
Your point does not refer to the Minutes of 1 March .
No , this can be done once the order of business has been established .
That is now the time when we deal with points of order .
This will be corrected .
( The Minutes were approved )
Thank you , Mr De Rossa .
The Rules of Procedure do not give me the authority to take this step .
This question was , therefore , very central to the concerns of the Conference of Presidents .
There has , however , been no request for an amendment .
We export 90 % of our entire production .
Thank you , Mr Hyland .
I cannot take this step , however .
The House will judge whether this request is admissible .
The Rules of Procedure do not stipulate what to do in these circumstances .
In any event , however , the House must decide .
There is one problem , however .
In this sense , I should like to express support for my fellow MEP .
I entirely agree with Mr Swoboda .
It is therefore a matter of urgency .
There was no vote for a resolution .
In this instance , are we going to have both a statement as well as a resolution ?
Personally speaking , I would be in favour of this .
You can so decide under your authority as President .
Madam President , I did not really intend to speak .
Who is in favour , in principle , of holding this debate ?
( The House gave its assent )
Madam President , I have been indicating for a long time that I wished to speak .
I just want to make one point in relation to this whole issue of foot-and-mouth .
We have to stop live exports .
In fact , that is what is responsible for bringing it into Northern Ireland .
Luckily , the Irish Government has been able to contain it ; the same goes for Britain .
Madam President , I have been asking to speak for 15 minutes .
You did not see me - you do not look in this direction very often .
I have nothing to say with regard to the content .
I think that there are many good reasons to hold a debate .
We do not take a decision by majority that goes against our own Rules of Procedure .
I think that we can draw an analogy between this situation and our own .
I do not think that any Member here was swayed by them .
I spoke to you , Madam President , on this very same subject at the beginning of the month .
First of all , there is a requirement for timely action .
We therefore need an explanation and we need it now , not in September .
Lastly , I shall mention the requirement for Parliament to maintain its credibility .
As a group , we feel that this would be a better way forward .
I do not think that we can open a debate on this issue .
I have received a request from the representatives of the two groups concerned .
Mr Lannoye , did you have a point of order ?
Mr Swoboda quite rightly said that we must carry out an enquiry .
( The House rejected the request )
Madam President , I have a point of order relating to the Nassauer report .
Normally this Parliament is consulted on a Commission proposal .
I am not seeking to remove the Nassauer report from the agenda .
Nor was I , just now , seeking to prevent us discussing foot-and-mouth .
Thank you , Mr Corbett .
Mr Swoboda ' s wise words were music to my ears .
Can the Group of the Greens count on his support if we submit a proposal to that effect ?
Relating to Thursday : President .
( Parliament gave its assent )
The order of business is thus agreed .
Speeches relating to points of order
That is an awful lot of months !
Thank you very much . I look forward to your response .
Thank you , Mr Schulz .
I shall give clear answers to the three points that you have raised .
You are asking me if I would now refer this matter to the Legal Affairs Committee .
That is all the information that I can give to you .
No , Mr Medina Ortega , you are slightly mistaken .
There are several precedents .
As you will see , this will actually be very interesting .
In particular , there was the case of Mr Balfe , the British MEP .
Madam President , you have given Mr Schulz an answer .
I am grateful to you for that .
We must accept it , but we do not agree with it .
Mr Medina has now made this quite clear as well .
We will continue to pursue this issue .
We will be looking very closely at the reasons why this process has taken so long .
I am quite astonished by his statement .
But this time , he has astonished me .
( Heckling )
Our full support for Mr Schulz !
Do you know who else uses this argument ?
( Applause from the left )
Our group has never gone against the country or against Austria .
( Applause from the left )
Mrs Napoletano did not say that we are against a discussion of this issue .
( Applause from the left )
I have always respected him for this attitude , in spite of our conflicting political beliefs .
Mr Schulz , thank you for asking this question .
I must say that I did wonder about this .
It is very simple .
I do not think that it is possible Mr Schulz .
I am sorry but you are overstepping the mark a little , and I have been very patient .
If you wish , we can arrange a meeting so that we can continue this debate .
A number of requests to make points of order have been tabled .
Unfortunately , this does not fall within the remit of Parliament .
In other words , these processes are quite normal ; they are certainly not unusual .
I fully support your approach towards these two immunity cases .
It is a legal , not a political issue .
Madam President , on a point of order .
Mr Balfe , I was referring to when you gave evidence as a witness .
Six of the 16 crew lost their lives .
European fishermen have , once again , paid their tribute to the sea .
I shall gladly do what you have asked , Mr Varela .
They are to be buried in their own country this afternoon .
In the meantime , 57 people have been arrested .
The conflict in the Basque country bears some resemblance to that in Northern Ireland .
The Spanish and French Governments unfortunately have not .
That is a very sad reality .
As you can see , terrorism is indiscriminate and also strikes at democratic nationalists .
Madam President , I notice that Mr Gorostiaga is no longer in his seat .
On behalf of the workers , I would ask you to communicate this concern to the relevant committee .
These are actions which , in my opinion , we can in no way endorse .
The situation has reached dramatic proportions .
Israel cannot continue to violate the Geneva International Conventions and collective punishment is wrong .
Thank you , Mrs Morgantini .
I shall , of course , do what you have asked me to do .
Safe transport of radioactive material
I am intrigued to see Commissioner Lamy here this afternoon .
This is not an appropriate theme with which to score political points .
That is far more dangerous than the transports themselves .
No one can possibly object to that .
A multi-annual plan should also be adopted by the Community .
We broadly support this view .
In fact , the transport of radioactive waste presents the greatest risk due to the levels of radioactivity .
To say the opposite would be a manipulation of the truth .
Is it a crime of lèse-majesté to want to see an end to these bombs on wheels ?
If reprocessing did not take place , radioactive waste would not be transported .
This means , Mr President , that it has been illegally transported as well .
There is no point in seeking to curtail the debate , as the report is trying to do .
Mr President , I very much welcome this report on the transportation of radioactive material within the European Union .
Cartloads of nuclear waste are regularly stored at marshalling yards in Willesden .
I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Hatzidakis , on his report .
This industry is never complacent .
Its record in the transportation of dangerous goods is amongst the best .
It is tendentious and ill-informed .
The sooner we realise that the better .
Transporting radioactive material is not a risk-free business , as the report points out .
Being able to voice their opinion and take part in demonstrations is part of that .
We are united in our condemnation of violence against people and property , because it is counterproductive .
The Group of the Greens do not want to understand the undeniable environmental advantages of nuclear power .
What a paradox !
The transport of radioactive material is in compliance with the regulations of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
I urge everyone to keep to the facts .
This is not what the report is about .
The emphasis should then , however , be on compulsory prior notice of the transport of nuclear material .
It is not for us to deliver an opinion on the appropriateness of using reprocessing technology .
It is true that it does not include any specific reference to the transportation of radioactive material .
That is what the Commission wished to say on the subject of this report .
As I said in my opening remark , we feel that this report makes a useful contribution .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
WTO negotiations on the built-in agenda
Our individual demands are in line with our proposals at the multilateral round in Seattle .
So I would ask my colleagues from the other interested committees to be patient until then .
Let me pick out a few points .
We also advocate , however , the vigorous defence of the existing European model of agriculture based on multifunctionality .
The precise details are set out in the report .
Regarding services : we wish to achieve further progressive liberalisation of the trade in services .
We are seeking greater transparency in the preparation and conduct of ministerial meetings .
But never mind !
So the WTO negotiations are extremely important for SMEs in particular .
That is why it is necessary , in my view , to have this debate .
I also believe that the precautionary principle is very important for our future .
I should like to stress three points in this report that I believe are essential .
This , of course , is directed at Commissioner Pascal Lamy .
First , two questions addressed to the Commission .
Secondly , paragraph 22 , which Mr Seguro just mentioned .
I understand that GATS do not necessarily affect publicly controlled utilities .
Now , two observations .
Mr President , I find the report by our fellow Member , Mr Schwaiger to be generally positive .
Having said that , I have four comments to make .
The agriculture line is not without its grey areas .
Thirdly , the line on services is not satisfactory .
There is talk of ' further progressive liberalisation ' .
That is a unilateral objective .
That is not enough .
We have to work in the context of universal public assets .
There is one last point I should like to raise on a major problem of governance .
It is the responsibility of every single one of us .
This is an approach that is critical in ensuring the success of the organisation of world trade .
Improved market access for the least developed countries is a case in point .
The long transitional periods , however , for bananas , sugar and rice are most regrettable .
Alongside this , the free exchange of services also impacts on the developing countries .
Are their fragile economies given the opportunity to prepare for competition ?
After all , justice requires policy as well as the useful instrument of free trade .
Finally , I would like to express my appreciation of the sound work done by the rapporteur .
Firstly , surely it is dangerous to negotiate separately on the Built-In Agenda ?
Should the failure at Seattle not lead us to rethink the entire emphasis of negotiations ?
Yet is the situation really still the same ?
There have been great strides forward in public opinion regarding the regulation of international trade .
Is that still compatible with developments ?
Do we not need further deliberation on the subject ?
All these excellent provisions , however , have disappeared from the final version .
Similarly notable by their absence are any provisions on parliamentary scrutiny .
We think this an essential precondition in order to properly safeguard the interests of the citizens of Europe .
Mr President , the World Trade Organisation is a tremendous economic success story .
Mr Schwaiger 's report provides a fresh and very sound basis on which to proceed .
Should more be done in the field of agriculture ?
How can effective consumer protection be safeguarded ?
There are many other questions as well .
How great , in reality , are the differences between the parties negotiating on the Built-In Agenda ?
Does this document signal a move away from that ?
What impact will this have on cooperation with the European Parliament ?
And will this negotiating strategy include the developing countries as well ?
There must be no trade-off of concessions in the agricultural sector in exchange for concessions in other negotiating areas .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur very warmly on his report .
In advance of this debate , however , I should like to raise two specific issues .
The precautionary principle must apply to the WTO as well .
Eleven million people will die of preventable diseases this year .
This is of deep concern .
Again , they must be looked at separately in this context .
There are countless examples of this .
That is amply demonstrated by the current agricultural crisis which we are witnessing here in the European Union .
Unless we have these three basic elements of life , everything else is irrelevant .
What is the situation with regard to the operating agreement ?
Is a review planned , and what form can and will this take ?
That is my first question .
What is the Commission planning to do ?
What are the options for the European Union ?
There is a great deal of cause for concern .
The WTO is what it is .
As ever , all that is lacking is the will to implement them .
That is the stage we are at today .
Concerning agriculture , we agree with you .
Firstly , I confirm that the European Union ' s negotiating position is indeed shaped by Agenda 2000 .
That is part of our agenda .
Our position on services is , briefly , as follows .
Secondly , we wish to take development issues into consideration .
This is a matter that was referred to us last summer .
What role does intellectual property have to play in this context ?
In our opinion , it has an essential role in stimulating innovation and research .
At this stage we do not need any official amendment to that mandate .
We shall return to that matter when the time comes .
That brings me straight to the institutional aspect of your report .
We agree that the parliaments should be involved to a greater extent in the WTO debates .
Thank you , Commissioner Lamy .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
COM in the sugar sector
I do not think so .
This is the proposal I put to you today as your rapporteur .
This organisation of the markets is actually based on a production quotas system .
This entails strict supervision of the volumes produced .
It is true that the corollary of this situation is a specific internal price .
This criticism which has been widely expressed in various reports and media also needs some clarification .
Moreover , 75 % of sugar is consumed in the form of processed products .
The price of these sugar products fluctuates quite independently of the price of sugar .
For the time being , there is one observation that must be made .
That is not a blank cheque , however .
Which sections of the population will be hit hardest as a result ?
Finally , we would like to know the actual level of competition within the European sugar market .
Is there or is there not room for genuine competition ?
Some people also say that the common organisation of the market in sugar is a dinosaur .
It would be wrong to change the compensation system for storage costs ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
They also protect consumer interests in terms of both prices and quality specifications .
The dates on which the current regime expires have been brought into line with the deadlines agreed in Berlin .
The system for producing sugar from sugar beet is a self-financing system .
So we are delighted to give our support to the Daul report .
The Commission omits to say how the period 2003-2006 is to be funded .
I remember our debate here on the common organisation of the market in pig meat .
Production must be adjusted strictly in line with consumption in the European Union .
It is also quite reasonable for us to accept sugar from the least developed , poorest countries .
Because even if the money is forthcoming it is , after all , still dumping .
The practice of the European Union providing public money to help out with storage costs must also stop .
I am in favour of the sugar market being self-supporting .
Then it should be sustained in this way .
Because these transitional measures form part of systematic cuts across the board ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Central to any future reform must be income stability for farmers .
It costs billions and has led to enormous inefficiency in the allocation of the world ' s sugar production .
Mr President , this report represents a huge missed opportunity .
So what we need is serious , well-thought out reform .
Rapporteur Daul does not breathe a word about this report by the Court of Auditors .
It has capitulated before the interests and the sweet-voiced lobbying of the sugar industry .
This translates into an annual cost of EUR 30 million .
Talk about competition !
Rapporteur Daul is right to reject these plans from the Commission .
Only the soft drinks multinationals and foodstuffs industry stand to gain from liberalisation .
Those who lose out are the hundreds of thousands of European farmers who grow sugar beet .
I heard Mrs Gill talking about the way in which the consumer was going to benefit .
Mr Daul , you said that the sugar regime was a special agreement .
I would argue a little bit with you on that because I believe it is unique .
First of all , the tax-payer does not pay for it .
It is very important that we continue to support those countries .
Please do not try to mend this system .
It is therefore striking that the costs of this policy should form the subject of another dispute .
The policy is said to be expensive and cost the consumers dearly .
But I expect that we will again be entering into this discussion during the mid-term review of European policy .
I should simply like to refer to the BSE crisis .
In my opinion , this is the key point in this proposal .
We farmers need a policy on which we can rely .
And why until 2003 ?
The Commission cannot therefore accept a series of amendments for the following reasons .
Amendments Nos 6 , 21 and 40 provide for the minimum stock system to be kept .
As early as 1995 it was therefore decided to abolish it .
There is therefore no need to spell this out in the proposals .
This is because our proposal already provides for an adjustment of this kind in Article 10 .
Commissioner , thank you for your comprehensive response .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Information and communication
Fourthly , what are the pillars ?
The year 2001 will see the launch of studies on the cost-effectiveness of the Representations .
This effort must be continued and increased manifold .
Mr President , Commissioner , you had a rather thankless task , my dear Mr Monti .
That is the problem .
During the course of the project they learnt more about it .
Now it has been put on someone else 's desk and is in limbo .
This is a dreadful state of affairs .
It is like a poor orphan .
No one really cares about it ; no one is really responsible for it .
They do exist .
There are networks which work incredibly well and it should use them .
When I consider that you praise the Info-Points here !
Today they do not know whether they will still exist next year .
How are people supposed to work there and be motivated to motivate others ?
In my view there is much more to be done in this field .
You said it yourself .
Our institutions are regarded with contempt at worst and apathy at best .
I have to ask why the interinstitutional talks on this issue are still stalled ?
Certainly it will have a partner in Parliament in attempting to rework the system radically .
In my own country , my party is famed for its spin-doctors .
This is a task which the Commission has been all too lax about .
There are also some thoroughly topical and practical problems .
There are too many bureaucratic obstacles to accessing information .
EU information is now treated as a branch of the EU ' s Offices for Official Publications .
The Official Journal should be available free of charge on the Europa server .
Too much information is only available in the EU ' s main languages .
We have eleven official languages in the EU , and all eleven must be used .
There must be a determination to make optimum use of the information technology now available .
I am very anxious to know how the Commission will get to grips with the task .
Commissioner , this task has now become a matter of urgency .
We have produced it in three months .
I doubt it .
With whom are we supposed to negotiate politically on this issue ?
You said your ' colleagues responsible for the matter .
Who are they ?
We do not know them . We would like to know who they are .
Sometimes my impatience gives way to disappointment .
I ask myself the following questions : what has happened since 14 April 2000 ?
Where is the master plan which we were promised at that time ?
Where is the specific timetable and programme of measures ?
Where is the clear division of responsibilities in the Commission ?
On 14 April , Commissioner Reding spoke here .
Today you have stood in for us .
There is no clear strategy .
We do not need a re-nationalisation of information policy .
The Commission is not simply a channel for EU funds ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
I would like to make a few brief comments .
Clearly , this transfer raises logistical problems , but these will be resolved by the summer .
May I finally make a point that I think underlies much of what has been said .
We all realise that so much more has to be done .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
The next item is three oral questions to the Commission :
On the one hand , international competition remains extremely distorted .
This can only be to the detriment of European shipyards .
This means additional burdens and dangers in an already complicated situation .
It may be disastrous for individual companies .
The course of events so far really does seem rather odd .
Allow me to draw a comparison between this and a sporting competition .
On the contrary , the prizes are increasing .
Shipbuilding is an industry for developed countries , not an industry for low-wage countries .
The resulting growth in productivity triggers further cuts in the workforce .
I do not wish to be misunderstood .
Of course , the Federal German Government is also called upon to act here .
Mr President , I was delighted by the Commissioner ' s explanations .
Mr President , I very much welcome what the Commissioner has said , for three reasons .
Therefore we need to take action very quickly .
This must be done now .
The company made a very interesting statement after Harland & Wolff were turned down .
I would so like to believe this , from our position in the here and now .
We know that shipbuilding is the last industrial sector to be subsidised .
This is not just about Europe any more ; nor is it just about South Korea .
It is in actual fact about the new image of a modern European Union .
That is why we are asking you so urgently to provide help .
Believe me that we do not wish to discover that our trust in you has been misplaced .
It was interesting to hear about the plans .
I think the WTO solution to this dispute should be expedited .
Mr President , this debate revolves around two or three main themes .
There is not much disagreement among us .
I said this very clearly and that is why we are applying pressure .
It was unhelpful vis-à-vis the Korean threat and harmful to our own single market .
The Korean threat has persisted in spite of the contract-related operating aid .
It had to be discontinued .
It has been discontinued .
This does not mean that the Korean problem is being ignored .
Thank you , Commissioner , for your response to the questions .
The debate is closed .
( The sitting was closed at 9.55 p.m. )
Opening of the Session
I declare the 2001-2002 session of the European Parliament open .
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
( The Minutes were approved )
We have taken note of your comment , Mr Helmer .
I said then that one in two flights were being cancelled .
I would ask the President to come to a better arrangement with Air France .
We will do something about it , Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel .
Decision on urgent procedure
It is our opinion that we have time to write a proper report .
( Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure )
6.15 p.m. to 7 p.m. : Question Time to the Council .
Are there speakers for and against the motion ?
Mr President , I think that is a good suggestion .
We discussed this yesterday .
That is clear .
It is a fundamental parliamentary right .
I think it is ridiculous that we always cut corners in this area .
Members submit their questions within the time stipulated and have a right to receive answers to those questions .
( Parliament approved the amendment to the agenda )
Carriers ' liability
I also believe , however , that the responsibility of carriers should be limited .
That would be draconian and excessive .
The final point is that penalties must be approximated throughout Europe .
It is important that we deal with this matter .
Carriers must not be left alone ; the authorities have responsibilities too .
On that basis , I commend my report to the House .
The problem is how to harmonise the various legislation of the Member States and to seek formulas for approximation .
This is not the only way to combat illegal human trafficking .
It is essential that we safeguard the institution of asylum .
Mr President , two factors play a role in this proposal .
The first one is to crack down on the smuggling of human beings as an element of organised crime .
All too often do we read and see accounts of human beings being treated in a most degrading manner .
The example of the Dover Chinese has left us all with a sick feeling in our stomachs .
The other element is the right to asylum .
People who escape poverty , misery or war cannot be blamed for their actions .
What would we do in the same situation ?
Europe has always adopted a humanitarian stance , and it should stay that way .
In this respect , another factor comes into play with regard to this proposal .
Today ' s proposal is not about whether we should or should not introduce penalties for carriers .
Today ' s proposal only aims to harmonise these penalties .
We hope that this amendment will be adopted and therefore consider the harmonisation to be acceptable as a whole .
Should he perhaps check their documents ?
I would like to be clear about who will be checking all these documents in future .
In my opinion , there are not enough people available to check all documents .
Mr President , this proposal is about dealing with symptoms of an exceptionally serious disease .
Whom is it imagined will be intimidated by this proposal ?
Whom is it imagined will profit from this ?
It will be the Mafia and other unscrupulous people .
Take a country like Afghanistan which is now almost surrounded by closed borders .
Pakistan does not want to take any more refugees .
Whom do we want them to pay ?
The Mafia , or the church and humanitarian organisations ?
If we increase the penalty , then we see the price rise .
People who have to become refugees will pay dearly for the proposal we are discussing now .
A heavier penalty will also mean that there will be fewer suppliers in this market .
Fewer people will offer to help future refugees . Those who remain will be the Mafia .
I understand that there are Member States which are very worried about this proposal .
I understand that the Swedish Presidency is alarmed by it .
This distinction crucially determines the situation into which we put refugees .
That is our own responsibility .
Organised crime gangs with vast resources at their disposal are operating with impunity .
The number of applications from Iranians more than doubled .
I say that with deep regret .
We are just helping the mafia to grow richer .
A simple and efficient solution is being proposed here by the Commission .
This must be made to apply to all types of passenger carriers , including railway companies .
The carrier cannot , on the other hand , be expected to take charge of passengers ' return transportation .
This is the only way to ensure that the persons concerned are really returned in a proper manner .
The Commission has presented us with a document which intends to deal with the problem of human trafficking .
Mr President , we are going to penalise carriers who carry people lacking the appropriate documents .
This is good .
All traffickers in human beings know that they are committing a crime .
Absolutely all of them know it .
I do not believe , however , that we are going to stop them through this kind of measure .
I think we should bear this in mind .
This fragmented approach is neither coherent nor sensible .
There are other amendments to this report also worthy of consideration .
I shall be supporting Amendment No 12 .
Airline staff are already being forced into the role of auxiliary police as a result of it .
The EU will become even more of a community of closed doors .
This is surely not the way in which we want to deal with refugees and immigrants in future .
This is a situation that is intolerable in the extreme .
Please allow me to conclude with a remark about my own country .
Every proposal from the Commission that moves in this direction is rejected by the German Interior Minister .
Vote against the Kirkhope report !
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , not everything that is legal is also legitimate .
Not everything that is illegal is also illegitimate .
We have spoken a great deal here today about crime .
This is acknowledged even by the UNHCR .
They have been told that these people are easy to recognise !
Mr President , may I start with a remark on procedure .
Therefore the Commission will confine itself to three main remarks .
I do not think that we are privatising the fight against illegal immigration .
I must say that I see it very differently .
So , we have one strict criterion to analyse the French proposal .
The draft we are considering today is only a first step .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
Temporary protection for displaced persons
This also applies to the setting up of a reception scheme for displaced persons .
This attitude is reprehensible , for we would do well to remind ourselves of what is actually at issue .
This affects hundreds of thousands of people at the same time .
Of course , they deserve a dignified reception .
Of course , the European Member States should share out the responsibility fairly and squarely by making sound agreements .
This has not happened to a satisfactory level in the past .
Mr President , the European Commission has done a good job .
The present proposal outshines the previous two proposals .
That aspect , therefore , will enter into effect at the same time as the rest of the scheme .
That is the good news .
I would now like to mention a few aspects where there is room for improvement .
This must be spelled out more clearly in the proposal .
I naturally hope that these will be adopted by this House .
What we are dealing with here is the issue of sharing the burden of receiving refugees from civil wars .
The problem is one that we have been familiar with for many years .
This is the reason why those concerned have been pressing for a solution to this problem for years .
May I remind you of the very unfortunate attempts of Commissioner Vitorino ' s predecessor , Mrs Gradin .
Those interested might care to take a look at these .
This is why I am grateful to you , Mr Vitorino for taking up these problems energetically after Tampere .
To that extent , you are also responsible for it .
Much as I welcome what you have done in principle , I also have some objections concerning particular details .
The issue of burden sharing is tied to one single problem .
Will it or will it not be made a rule that all Member States must receive refugees ?
The burden of receiving refugees simply cannot be offset by financial contributions .
This is the first weak point in your draft .
The second point , Mr Vitorino , relates to family reunification .
The indeterminate concept of the family that you use cannot be imposed upon all the Member States .
This is our second serious objection .
With the new mechanism that should be avoided .
We must ensure that appropriate provisions are in place .
I applaud the rapporteur for introducing a time limit for the Council decision .
However , my group has tabled an amendment to bring that forward .
We do not believe that three months is acceptable .
We are asking that it should be one month .
Amendments Nos 45 and 46 concern the rights of individuals .
Member States must try to do more to integrate refugees into society .
My group will be supporting this with the amendments to which I have just referred .
All these are to be welcomed .
What a contrast to the series of Members States ' proposals .
Mr Wiebenga 's report has been a model of how we can work constructively between the Commission and Parliament .
All we need is the Council to work as constructively with us .
Some Member States recognise the right to work and family reunification , others do not .
The sharing of the burden among the Member States is no longer separate from the stipulations .
And I was so glad to hear Mr Nassauer use the word solidarity .
It was solidarity with ourselves .
That is how matters stand , however .
I would particularly like to thank Mr Nassauer for adding to what the rapporteur has said in this respect .
The founding fathers created the ' European home ' as a place for solidarity , above all .
Otherwise , dual optionality will render the positive approach adopted in the Commission 's proposal superfluous .
The second important point is family reunification .
The compromise amendment tabled by the rapporteur , Mr Wiebenga , provides for the latter .
The European Union must act as one on this .
Is this only the case for Europeans ?
I truly believe that we can take account of them .
Mr President , I too would like to thank Mr Wiebenga for his sterling work .
The first concerns the much-debated Article 13 ( 1 ) .
It is , in my view , a modest proposal , but it touches upon an important principle .
It now claims that Member States are entitled to reunify unmarried couples .
That does not require European agreement , for that is already the case now .
I also believe that it is unwise to start moving people around unnecessarily .
Pursuant to Article 24 , the Refugee Fund has to provide for financial solidarity .
But this fund has a maximum of EUR 10 million annually at its disposal for displaced persons .
That just about covers the cost of two tents and a hot-water bottle .
Unless this fund grows substantially , I fear for Europe ' s hospitality .
We regard that as a serious defect of the Commission 's proposal .
Nobody wants to abandon their land , their culture or their family .
I sincerely believe not .
I believe so .
This is a further step by the European Union in the fight against terrorism .
Despite this , I should like to identify two positive aspects today .
Commissioner Vitorino deserves every support for his excellent helmsmanship in this matter .
They should not be mutually exclusive .
I thank Mr Wiebenga for amending the directive to that effect .
We have not heard the last of this .
Of course we share our responsibility .
We have to .
The Member States must deal with this type of situation in a homogenous and cooperative way .
I believe that on this occasion Parliament has done its job .
The Commission has also demonstrated its will and done its job .
We just have to hope now that the Council does its duty .
And we know that the European Parliament is extremely concerned with this principle .
I believe I discussed it with Mr Nassauer more than seven years ago .
I understand Mr von Boetticher 's problem and even agree with his comment about the difficulties .
But I do want to emphasise that these really must be exceptional reasons .
Moreover , the concept of voluntary action by both sides introduces a transparent system .
I cannot guarantee that the system will work .
I warmly thank the Members who have taken part in this debate .
I am a teacher by profession .
So you know what I am talking about .
Thank you Commissioner Vitorino .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
Visas / Mutual recognition of decisions on expulsion
by Mr Deprez ( A5-0066 / 2001 ) ,
The first is a political error against the Community spirit and against the spirit of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
The second mistake is , I believe , an institutional one .
The Council committed a third mistake , this time vis-à-vis the Commission .
The fourth error concerns Parliament directly .
That is not just a democratic deficit , it is a real denial of democracy .
This is amazingly difficult to understand .
My own country , Denmark , is among the worst .
We are not building them between us , we are building them around us .
Furthermore , the legal objective of the initiative is now quite clear .
But the Community needs a legal basis for such action .
A legal objective is no replacement for a legal basis .
That is quite a different kettle of fish .
We therefore propose that this initiative be rejected .
At the same time we have immediately presented a suggestion for solving this problem .
That would solve all the problems associated with this initiative .
We must achieve joint consensus and consideration .
No to these three initiatives .
And yet here we are , going through the motions of a debate all over again .
All too often we are presented with apparently simple proposals concerning very real and complex problems .
However , things are not that straightforward .
I trust the Council will take due note so that we can avoid doing so .
Exactly what happened , we do not know .
To impose visa requirements upon the citizens of approximately 130 countries in unworthy of European democracy .
As matters now stand , there is no overview or comprehensive vision .
Mr President , what is the best way to keep out all the undesirables ?
What further barriers can we add to fortress Schengen to protect ourselves from outside threats ?
We know that trafficking in human beings exists and that there are criminal networks .
We are all aware that fabulous sums can be made out of exploiting human misery .
So if we are to combat this trafficking effectively we will have to attack the roots of the evil .
Repression alone is not enough .
We must not confuse the traffickers with their victims .
We must seek out and penalise those who exploit illegal labour .
In fact , immigration and economics go hand in hand .
Let us not make solidarity and humanity into an offence .
We must guarantee that freedom of movement .
I hope with all my heart that Europe can finally offer us that freedom .
Mr President , I am speaking on behalf of the Bonino List .
The Nassauer report also - and quite rightly - proposes that the French initiative should be rejected .
All three reports have been rejected by the competent committee on formal grounds .
The question which arises is why this constant preoccupation with immigrants ?
Perhaps there is no institutional framework ?
This is what causes mass immigration .
( The President cut the speaker off )
I will begin with the aspects relating to the provisions that come within the Schengen framework .
The Commission agrees with the analysis and the arguments put forward by Mr Deprez in his explanatory statement .
However , Title IV contains no institutional derogation from Article 202 of the Treaty .
Moreover , most of the implementing measures linked to these instruments are purely technical in nature .
... measures which the Commission and Parliament can , in fact , take jointly .
This policy will include common principles , together with common standards and measures .
Thank you Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
European crime prevention network
European crime prevention network ( continuation )
This is an important and ambitious project , because crime knows no borders .
We welcome this .
This crime prevention network is also important in other respects .
This will also significantly speed up the process of coordinating national strategies .
Most of these recommendations have been fully implemented .
The enhanced role of Europol certainly represents a major step forward in this context .
The primary motive of much organised crime is financial crime .
Computer-related crimes do not stop at conventional State borders .
A considerable number of actions to fight cyber-crime are already under way in international fora .
However , whether we want a bureaucratic monstrosity is another matter .
The Lisbon Monitoring Centre has been mentioned .
There is another reason why we are going to vote against the motion .
What will be done with the millions of euros allocated to this programme every year ?
Furthermore , Hippocrates is not easy to understand .
Measures are therefore being created and introduced with no regard to their relevance or effectiveness .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
We shall now proceed to the votes .
We are certainly keeping the precedent set by the Ceyhun report in mind , Mr Watson .
The amended initiative has been rejected .
Mr President , I am the rapporteur who was in the same position last month .
What are the representatives of the Council in this Chamber here for , anyway ?
The rapporteur was made aware of this beforehand .
The rapporteur has asked for the floor .
I therefore still urge Members not to vote for this amendment .
Mr van den Bos has the floor for a point of order .
It is unfortunate that Air France is unable to provide this connection without any serious delays .
This morning , I took part in an important meeting organised by Mr Pronk on pensions in France .
There will probably be a law saying that they can only eat once a day .
This is too expensive and it is bad for EU consumers and sugar processors .
This is not a sustainable solution .
An increase of 30 000 tonnes has therefore been proposed .
Abolishing the system , therefore , will mean that sugar manufacturers will bear the storage costs .
I am opposed to another five year roll-over .
The momentum for reform is mounting .
Similarly , artificially high prices cannot be sustained .
. ( NL ) We should naturally like to congratulate the rapporteur on the result obtained .
The present European agricultural policy is no longer appropriate to our times .
The European citizens will understand this .
Farming is an economic activity in the fullest sense and needs long-term prospects .
The European Union must emphasise the commitments it entered into towards them .
- ( SV ) As a Swedish Christian Democrat , I have voted against this report .
We believe that the EU must open its agricultural sector to the developing world .
I find the Commission 's dose of sugar market reforms much sweeter to swallow .
Moreover , it is necessary to comply with WTO rules .
It is important for European consumers and for the European taxpayer .
We need to make cuts in the agricultural budget which is in dire need of reform .
The bottom line is that the common agricultural policy must be radically overhauled and reformed .
Kirkhope Report ( A5-0069 / 2001 )
I welcome it .
Furthermore , the exemptions from the penalties are not acceptable .
I therefore rejected them .
It is the responsibility of everyone to ensure that traffickers do not profit .
The severe sanctions proposed by the Council constitute a significant threat to the right of asylum .
The Kirkhope proposal will only lead to more illegal migration and to higher profits for the mafia .
Wiebenga Report ( A5-007 / 2001 )
Why didn 't you take action a year , two years ago , at the time of the crisis ?
You are late , very late ! "
However , Commissioner Vitorino has just presented the situation quite differently .
Deprez report ( A5-0066 / 2001 )
Frahm Report ( A5-0075 / 2001 )
Nassauer Report ( A5-0065 / 2001 )
Why is this ?
To that end , it introduces an instrument for the mutual recognition of these decisions .
Accordingly , an expulsion decision taken in one Member State can be enforced in another .
The present proposal for a directive does not address these matters .
It is confined simply to the mutual recognition of decisions already taken .
The proposal does not , therefore , set out to lay down Community rules on expulsion .
Otherwise , our Community policies would become meaningless .
Hatzidakis Report ( A5-0040 / 2001 )
Mr President , a policeman stops an articulated lorry in Germany because it is going too fast .
The official checks the cargo : it is radioactive material , all in order with all the necessary permits .
Couldn 't you have taken a longer , more isolated route ?
These goods are highly dangerous " .
Therefore , I took the shortest route for my consignment of radioactive material . "
Radioactivity poses grave dangers to health and the environment .
Only a few kilograms of separated plutonium are needed to build a crude nuclear explosive device .
That was not what the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism intended .
Let me conclude by emphasising the importance of transparency in this field .
Full information on the risks involved needs to be very widely disseminated on a continuous basis .
I have voted for this report although I have reservations about some aspects of it .
In particular , I believe that safety has to override all other considerations .
Nuclear waste should never be transported through densely populated areas .
The ' shortest route principal ' should be secondary to the ' safest route principle ' .
However , what is hard to grasp politically in this case is the way this has happened .
Likewise , we believe that too little attention has been devoted to the issue of exposure thresholds .
But even after that , we will be facing dangerous radioactive waste for many thousands of years .
There are many campaigns to stop these transports , and rightly so .
I do not subscribe to this point of view .
Schwaiger Report ( A5-0076 / 2001 )
Bon appétit !
Democratisation presupposes respect for and the protection of the rights of the workers .
With the European agriculture model , we have a common agricultural policy in mind .
Nor can we support duties affording protection against the developing world .
Confusion continues to prevail with regard to these aspects .
More than anything , it implies that the price of a product outweighs all other considerations .
The competition is forced to choose between cheaper deliveries or going under .
That is why there should be unlimited competition , ultimately at world level , if possible .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Final agreement on the reform of the system for international transfers of footballers
Ladies and gentlemen , please be seated .
I therefore see no need to amend Community law .
The discussions have led to clear progress in at least three key areas .
We must therefore ensure that they are given vocational training as well as sports training .
These are the mechanisms intended to achieve this .
Firstly , unilateral termination of a contract will be authorised only at the end of a season .
Some of their requests were met .
I attach particular importance to arbitration being independent and based on equal representation .
Indeed , Mrs Diamantopoulou offered her assistance in supporting ongoing dialogue at European level .
We will then have quantitative and qualitative information from which we can learn .
Madam President , I would like to thank the Commissioner , Mrs Reding , for being here today .
Are you not concerned that this could lead to us being buried in a veritable avalanche of court cases ?
The Commission ' s action was fully compliant with this Declaration .
I would like to ask the Commissioner a couple of questions about that .
First of all , I assume the solidarity fund is a general fund .
Agents will still find a way of getting round that .
Regarding the solidarity fund , there are two solidarity systems in place to compensate the training clubs .
There are two reasons , however , why these allocations cannot be too high .
Firstly we must adhere to the Bosman judgment .
The second component is the solidarity fund .
This solidarity fund will be sustained by a 5 % levy on each compensation payment for transfer .
There will therefore be a duplicate transfer system for clubs offering training .
You may rest assured that the Commission will carefully monitor the framing and implementation of this code of conduct .
This is something we can certainly all be satisfied with .
What legal protection do players have in such a situation ?
Are they in danger of being tied for a period during such a legal dispute ?
It is considered that training is completed by the age of 23 .
It will be a matter for the court , the Court of Arbitration , to judge who is right .
Thank you , Mrs Reding .
Of course , the proposal contains some sound points , such as compensation for training costs .
You have to admit that the Commission has not been able to change this aspect .
Madam President , Mr Lagendijk is correct .
We still have no answer on the issue of training compensation .
So far I cannot see how training compensation is going to deliver that .
They would be very happy for you to visit us in the north-west .
What is one thing in theory is completely different in reality .
I saw this on Monday , just after the agreement had been reached .
On Tuesday , I met the English Football League and representatives from clubs in the second division .
They were concerned and asked me to explain the terms of the agreement .
In response , they told me that they felt completely reassured .
Of course , we must see how things turn out in practice in the clubs .
Rest assured , we shall be monitoring this very closely .
Transparency must also play a part in the world of sport .
The calculation behind the effective training costs was recently posted on the FIFA website .
. ( FR ) Mr Heaton-Harris , I do not wish to interfere in the affairs of the UK .
I certainly hope that transparency and democracy come into play .
To come to the issue of training costs , we consider this issue to be quite straightforward .
That is why a ceiling will be imposed on the costs .
I made this point very clear and it is also part of the Nice Declaration .
Madam President , I believe that this agreement has enabled us to do two things .
In order words , you said that the Commission too recognises the special character of sport .
Since that time , the Commission ' s entire policy has taken the specific characteristics of sport into consideration .
And nothing has changed since then .
So , I hope this is perfectly clear .
We have , then , always respected the specific characteristics of sport .
I have a question regarding the latter .
The Commissioner says in that connection that she hopes that this will benefit the smaller clubs .
I am thinking of the composition and criteria for allocating funding , for example .
Is anything known about this yet ?
. ( FR ) We have FIFA ' s clear and distinct commitment that this will happen .
Madam President , I wish to begin by congratulating Commissioners Reding , Monti and Diamantopoulou .
We have all come a very long way since last August .
The principles that have been established , especially around the specificity of sport , are extremely important .
However , my worry remains with the players ' associations .
Unfortunately , this has not always been how it works in practice .
Everyone understands this .
The disciplinary measures were toned down considerably compared to what had been asked and was expected at the beginning .
That is a benefit for sportsmen and women .
Who then benefits from the stability of the championships and teams ?
Sport is the prime beneficiary , then the fans and spectators , but professional players benefit as well .
Indeed , would they still benefit from playing if sport were destroyed ?
My other question is about the transfer fee level , which is still unlimited .
You mentioned 5 % of the transfer fee , which would then be shared out .
. ( FR ) You are asking when all this will be put into practice .
These broad principles must be put into practice when applying the new rules of world football .
To deal specifically with the question of transfer fees , I have already answered a question on this subject .
We did not receive any complaints about the levels of transfer fees .
I have my own view on this , and , no doubt , you do as well .
The terms of the agreement appear to be positive .
It was certainly a matter that needed regulating .
So what will the next the stage be ?
Madam President , I am pleased that there has been an agreement .
I know FIFA has recommended it .
What would happen if that legal challenge is successful ?
Would we then have to go back to the drawing-board ?
It is fortunate that democracy is founded on the division of powers .
It is therefore up to the judges in the Court in Luxembourg to decide on their course of action .
I am referring to the Lehtonen and the Liège rulings .
With regard to the Balog ruling , we have to respect the judgment of the Court .
There was a demand for this system .
So let us all keep an eye on how this works out in practice .
Can this now be regarded as setting a precedent for all of them ?
I certainly hope that this is the case .
It is true that we have not discussed voluntary work as much as we should .
That is what constitutes the social dimension of sport .
How could sport in Europe exist without these people ?
You are quite right , Mrs Matikainen .
Mrs Matikainen , with regard to the calculations , the sporting federations must agree on realistic sums .
That is not what we want .
Thank you , Mrs Reding .
The debate is closed .
Evidence in civil and commercial matters
What is the ultimate aim of this German initiative ?
This legal instrument will also help to counter a trend which I view with increasing scepticism .
This is actually a trend that runs counter to the idea of the constitutional state .
Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his work on this report .
I do not believe that this square can be circled .
However , I support the regulation which is before us today .
In view of these considerations , the Commission welcomes the German initiative for a regulation in this field .
We therefore welcome the support the rapporteur has given to this initiative .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Fight against fraud
Of course , one of the questions here is the independence of OLAF and its Director .
The Commission 's position on this is inconsistent .
Mrs Schreyer , this transfer took place despite explicit warnings from this House .
It is now the responsibility of the Commission to eliminate the obstacles I have described .
It only makes sense to remove the present reserve if this condition is met .
This problem would to a large extent be solved if there were a public prosecutor for internal matters .
That would require an amendment to the Treaties .
Such an amendment failed in Nice because of opposition from several Member States .
However , the Commission cannot just sit back and do nothing , now of all times .
In other words , the Commission must exercise its right of initiative .
We need another great leap forward .
So the Commission should not resort to artifice to obstruct that control .
Those with nothing to hide have nothing to fear from such control .
Despite this , we have still tabled a few amendments to his report .
We endorse Mr Bösch ' s observations with regard to OLAF ' s role .
Independence is a great good .
That discrepancy will need to be done away with .
We can support Mr Bösch ' s late amendment on Switzerland .
The nature of OLAF ' s work is such that certain aspects must remain confidential and perhaps even secret .
Allow me to comment on the sore points .
First of all , OLAF ' s necessary independence .
This also means that the Commission will refrain from intervening in appointments in any shape or form .
Can Commissioner Schreyer tell me how the Commission has reacted to Paragraphs 3 to 6 ?
Second sore point : the European Public Prosecutor .
We know that a change in the Treaty is needed for this .
We will therefore need to continue putting pressure on the Member States .
It is true that what we are asking now is not as far-reaching .
What are your thoughts on the matter , Commissioner Schreyer ?
Third sore point : the cooperation between Member States .
I am delighted that quite a few Member States , including my own country , have offered their support .
Fourth sore point : the disclosure of information .
I was one of the people who rejected the framework agreement between the Commission and Parliament .
Consequently , my group will not be supporting the amendments which play down these matters or disguise them .
It is a difficult matter .
The EC Court of Auditors has not seen fit to recommend it .
There is some unfinished business which speaks against granting a discharge .
The Commission knows what it is .
The Committee on Budgetary Control has expressed in detail what it sees as matters of confusion to the Commission .
There are still some matters that are being hushed up .
This will not do . Mr Bösch is right .
This is the moment of truth for Mr Prodi ' s Commission .
In order to enforce this cooperation , the Commission must put sanctions in place .
In fact , what sanctions are prompting Spain to clear up the flax fraud ?
They seem logical measures to take , but not to the Commission .
That is how the company Fléchard is starting to form part of a European soap : to be continued !
OLAF ' s efficiency is being threatened by a lack of staff .
In this connection , the Commission should avoid any conflict of interest .
As elected representatives of the people , this Parliament has a supervisory task .
It is unfortunate that the Commission is forever putting spanners in the works .
To the Commission , transparency is an opaque word .
What is more , it is evident that we are dealing with people who are repeating the same offence .
We need an independent OLAF able to operate efficiently .
I must congratulate Herbert Bösch on his excellent report .
So , what we have before us today is a good report .
I should like to reiterate that we are all determined to combat fraud and recover the money .
I shall , however , focus my attention on the problem of fraud and irregularities .
I would like to express my concern about this position , for which I have two reasons .
I support what Mr Mulder has just said regarding a classification of irregularities .
In relation to this , several speakers have mentioned the case of the adulterated butter .
The Commission must be in a position to help us to achieve our aim .
The European Commission and the European Parliament should work together more closely in combating fraud .
Mr Bösch has drafted a creditable report and I would like to thank him for it .
The report also shows clearly how important it was to establish OLAF in 1999 .
, Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control .
Let me emphasise once again that we are talking about taxpayers ' money here .
We must do our best to protect it .
And the Director himself must set out in advance a clearly structured programme of work .
Parliament and the relevant institutions should do precisely that .
Lastly , there is also administrative liability .
I think he knows how highly I rate his work .
I would therefore like to comment on a few points that have been mentioned in the debate .
This is a positive point that should be take into account in further discussions .
Nevertheless , I would like to take this opportunity to give the Commission some sound advice .
That could certainly assist the subsequent deliberations in the context of the budget discharge process .
I would like to clarify this in the light of one particular example : Mr Seppänen 's speech .
No one can have any political interest in doing that .
We must make sure that these two things are not confused .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen . I would like to thank Mr Bösch for his report .
This question is certainly still open .
I am , of course , pleased that you support this in your report , Mr Bösch .
However , not all the other Member States have ratified it either .
I hope that will happen in April .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The debate will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Public access to environmental information
It is a precondition of the viability of this directive .
Quality is obviously a major factor when assessing the significance of the directive .
In other words , there must be information given on the methods used in taking measurements .
We have now found a format that , hopefully , will be appropriate for most Member States .
There has been a good deal of consensus regarding this directive .
As a legislative text is may also be more effective if it remains narrow in scope .
In all cases , however , a reply is required as soon as possible .
In this way , this directive will positively promote transparency throughout the EU .
The Commission text clearly covered privatised utilities .
Mr President , Commissioner , information is a basic principle of democracy .
The directive stipulates that the public authorities may make a charge for supplying information .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mrs Korhola has done a very good job .
I hope that it will be improved still further following the vote in Parliament .
Clearly , our present and future environmental problems must be solved at all levels .
Ten years after Rio , expectations have not been met .
The pressures on the environment have worsened and poverty continues to win ground in the world .
The report by Mrs Korhola , however , contains several pitfalls for everyone to clearly see .
I particularly regret the fact that it is not more ambitious .
As evidence of this , I would like to give an enlightening example , which I myself experienced .
I should like to raise a few points with which we might have difficulty .
We would then have to bring in private-sector telecoms and other telecom operations .
This does not fit in with the interpretation of Aarhus , so it could present problems .
Finally , I have problems with Amendment No 24 .
Before the Community can ratify the Convention , the Community ' s current legislation must be adjusted .
That is also one of the main aims of this proposal .
This is entirely in line with the Aarhus Convention .
The proposal nonetheless allows the Member States to decide how these obligations are to be put into practice .
In general , the Commission is able to approve these changes .
We think that certain amendments would lead to unduly detailed regulation of the issues included in the proposal .
I want to emphasise that this is a framework directive .
One issue which came up during the debate was that of how we are to deal with registers .
I also want to say a few words to Mr Bernié concerning the Life programme and different Life projects .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Question Time ( Commission )
Question No 47 by ( H-0191 / 01 ) :
That applies especially with regard to the meat industry here in Europe at present .
Mr President , if I may reiterate the point somewhat more clearly , why is this distinction made ?
From that point , no other meat will be marketable as quality meat .
That is the procedure .
Question No 48 by ( H-0193 / 01 ) :
At the time when it occurred the European Union granted the United Kingdom substantial aid to tackle the crisis .
The calf-processing premium has been funded in full from the Community budget .
The storage of intervention stocks will be fully financed by the Community as hitherto .
Thank you for the information you have just given us , Commissioner .
In this respect , the funding is guaranteed from our point of view .
There is a great deal of concern in Galicia , Commissioner .
In other words , the Commission is not at liberty to exceed the prescribed limit .
Within that framework , national support may be provided by the Member States .
) Mr President , I just put two very specific questions to the Commissioner .
He dealt with one , but has not replied to my question concerning premiums for beef .
He has not provided an answer to these queries .
Mr President , there is only one slaughter premium .
Question No 49 by ( H-0137 / 01 ) :
Question No 50 by ( H-0149 / 01 ) :
I wish to begin by thanking the honourable Member for his question .
The Commission shares his concerns .
The introduction of the euro has only limited effects on transfer costs .
In fact , the currency convergence costs represent about 20 % of the total .
What specific negotiating action could the Commission undertake in this connection , to give some satisfaction to consumers ?
I reiterate and stress that the Commission shares the anger of consumers .
I made that clear when I spoke on the Peijs report .
Both of these codes should make the transfer of money simpler , faster and cheaper .
So I would assure the honourable Members that we share their concerns .
The Commission is active in improving the situation .
That is something that would require further research .
As Mr Titley will appreciate , it is my colleague Mr Monti who deals with competition .
The Commission 's investigations on this have not yet reached their conclusion .
Mr President , it is true that we live in an era of industrial change and reconstruction .
The Commission appreciates that citizens and workers need to feel secure in this difficult time .
This requires forward planning , timely preparation and effective management of these processes .
Thirdly , nothing is more important than the social dialogue .
This is the aid commonly known as readaptation aid .
Mr President , I should like to express my thanks to the Commissioner for her extensive explanation .
I fully share much of what she says .
You will , however , understand my concern when I tell you that I live in Asturias .
So we must find this combination and address the situation .
Obviously we cannot prevent companies from merging or making acquisitions .
Your question is the fundamental question of how we can combine economic and social policies .
This is the main problem we face in Europe : how to combine competitiveness and cohesion .
As far as this merger is concerned , this is a field with many problems .
We have major acquisitions and mergers across Europe .
This is what I have just explained .
In this case there are three main elements .
The Asturias can be subsidised under the Treaty .
Secondly you can use the European framework .
Question No 52 by ( H-0134 / 01 ) :
Other points discussed at the same meeting relate to measures for the facilitation of trade .
These measures are likewise intended to contribute to the economic support of the northern part of Cyprus .
The Commission takes every opportunity to reiterate its position to the interested parties .
However , I do not particularly thank him for the reply which he has given me .
What is going to happen ?
What is going to happen ?
Are both sides equally to blame ?
Do both Mr Denktash and the President of the Republic of Cyprus bear the same responsibility ?
What initiatives does the Commission intend to take ?
Turkey needs to take a clear stand on this matter .
The Commission does not have the information that the honourable Member clearly possesses .
I am not aware of any such plans .
I have frequently made public pronouncements to that effect , and I am saying it again here .
You asked what happens next .
First of all , we shall continue the negotiations with Cyprus with no loss of momentum .
Thank you , Mr President .
Mr President , may I thank the honourable Member for making that point .
The position of Parliament on this question is no different to those of the Commission and the Council .
Question No 53 by ( H-0220 / 01 ) :
However , I should still like to ask you about two specific points .
What do I find conceivable ?
But at the present time I cannot make any precise predictions .
Our talks are still in their infancy .
Mr President , Commissioner , we are forever discussing transitional periods and the related problems .
Since the Europe Agreements are still in force , governments are naturally free to go on concluding bilateral accords .
The communication strategy will be implemented on a decentralised basis .
Local operators should , of course , take precedence in the selection of partners .
Each of the institutions and organisations to which the honourable Member referred is a suitable vehicle in my eyes .
I thank the Commissioner for a very thorough answer and ask him three questions .
If we do not sell enlargement we are likely to run into difficulties with ratification .
Secondly , how do these organisations get access to funds ?
Do they have to go through the national offices of the Commission ?
Is there information available on how they do that ?
Finally , he did not cover my point about twinning .
Would it be possible to bring forward proposals such as that ?
We are not the only ones , of course , who are active in this field .
Responsibility is spread somewhat more widely .
I wanted to ask whether this sort of thing is included in your plans .
My reply to the honourable Member is yes - the Euroregions are naturally included .
Thank you , Commissioner .
Mrs Reding has agreed to answer Questions Nos 56 , 57 and 58 together when their turn comes .
Question No 55 by ( H-0188 / 01 ) :
These new rules came into force on 1 January 2001 .
Some Member States also chose to pass legislation in order to supervise more closely the activities of football agents .
We should not , however , blame the whole profession for the improper behaviour of some of its agents .
The second problem is that of commercial transactions which involve young players .
The Commission was recently given the opportunity to show its concern about this matter .
Furthermore , a whole workshop in Lille was devoted to the subject of protecting young people .
One Member State has already done so .
As they deal with the same subject , Questions Nos 56 , 57 and 58 will be taken together .
Question No 56 by ( H-0219 / 01 ) :
Question No 57 by ( H-0239 / 01 ) :
I shall try to answer all three questions at the same time .
They are not all identical but they are along the same lines .
I can inform you , though , that already the whole of Europe is involved in an extensive debate .
Not one was excluded .
The issue was dealt with entirely openly in all the Member States .
Thank you for your answer , Commissioner .
There are only mother tongue languages , which shape individuals and their environment .
She has tackled this issue with an enormous amount of dedication and enthusiasm .
We must resolve the various minority situations before they develop into problems .
We need a preventive strategy .
We have 60 minority situations in the European Union today .
In the continent as a whole there are a total of 300 .
Could I ask the Commissioner for her opinion on such an approach ?
So , on the subject of unanimity and majority , cultural questions always require unanimity .
That is also why the European Year of Languages falls under the umbrella of education .
That is , you have said that no State had excluded any language from taking part .
I can reassure Mrs Ferrer that Catalan has not been omitted .
My second answer is that it seems , for now , that we are holding all the cards .
Mrs Ferrer will remember that I quoted the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which makes linguistic diversity a requirement .
Well , this will be a strong component in the future development of our linguistic policies in Europe .
Question No 59 by ( H-0132 / 01 ) :
Certainly not .
Lastly , I shall briefly touch on the subject of quality control .
Mr Papayannakis , these are the details that I can give to you today .
Commissioner , I would like to thank you very much indeed .
I have a list here from five years ago which provides some deadlines .
I would therefore like to know what is happening .
The second point obviously relates to quality .
This is a very important point .
Commissioner , I should like to end by saying that I am not very committed to the Olympic Games .
In actual fact , I am rather against them .
The reasons differ depending on the location .
I mentioned them earlier and I do not wish to go back to them .
No doubt there have been delays .
I am striving to be objective and to shoulder my responsibilities .
Question No 60 by ( H-0142 / 01 ) :
On 28 February , our departments met with a delegation from the National Assembly of Wales .
Thank you very much for your invitation , Mrs Kinnock .
I wanted to confirm this date with you in my answer to your question .
Question No 61 by ( H-0144 / 01 ) :
The Commission has set a final deadline of the end of 2001 for the funds to be spent .
And if this is not possible , can it guarantee that the funds will instead be withdrawn ?
They are unsatisfactory , particularly for Community initiatives .
The last reprogrammings to be carried out in this way were in 1999 .
Thank you , Commissioner Barnier .
That concludes Questions to the Commission .
( The sitting was suspended at 8 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
Emissions of pollutants from large combustion plants
Mr President , thank you so much for giving me the floor .
That plan did not work .
All credit to the Spanish .
The Council ' s common position came about with the greatest difficulty .
The common position lacked any vision whatsoever ; it was a pick-and-mix with something for everyone .
That cannot be the intention of European environmental legislation .
There were no hands raised when I looked round .
But let me point out one option that you can certainly exercise tomorrow before the vote .
I am sorry , but an intervention tomorrow is the only option left to you .
It is up to you , of course , whether you exercise it .
But let me repeat that I did look round the Chamber myself .
I am sorry .
( Laughter )
I assume that the other points of order concern the same matter .
Is that so ?
I fully support the Commission ' s activity in this area .
That would not have posed us any problems in our quest for a compromise .
The great pity is that we have not arrived at such a compromise .
The approach is right .
I believe we are jointly and severally bound to find an answer .
I believe the rapporteur has presented a good report . We should continue along this path .
Mr President , we have in front of us today a very important piece of legislation .
That is , of course , if the Member States have the will to do so .
The proposal has now reached its second reading .
We have now reached the point where we have in front of us the common position .
However , my group thinks that things can go further .
The Council has indicated that it is unwilling to accept further amendments from Parliament .
We are very mindful of that .
However , I would commend the report to the House .
Mr President , Mrs Oomen-Ruijten ' s report is sound .
The report on large combustion plants , take two , is also an important report .
It concerns acidification , traditional air pollution and ozone smog .
Acidification was a buzz word in the 80s .
That is when it all started .
We have a long way to go yet .
At the same time , the energy market has been liberalised .
That means that it is becoming more difficult to uphold environmental rules .
That is an unnecessary concession to the farmers who constitute their grassroots support .
However , the measures proposed in the common position are one-sided .
There are therefore major environmental gains to be had in this sector .
Rapporteur Oomen-Ruijten has made sound proposals to this effect .
First of all , the emission limit values must be brought into line with the current scope of technology .
Secondly , the bizarre exemption provisions must be deleted .
In my opinion , the exceptions for Spain and the islands of Crete and Rhodes are also unacceptable .
Thirdly , the offshore gas turbines must also meet emission requirements .
I have proposed an adaptation in Amendment No 43 .
We know that our use of fossil fuels is not a sustainable use of energy .
That is something we are really all agreed on .
Now it is time to put this strategy into effect . That is what this directive is about .
It is not only about acidifying air pollution in Sweden , Norway or Denmark .
That is something which Members must not forget .
We are on the right road .
The Council ' s limit values are not as far-reaching .
The Council appears to have lost faith in our ability to develop new technology at all .
Nothing would be as intended if too many exceptions were granted .
Minimum environmental requirements are needed in order to create common ground rules .
The demand for electricity - a commodity that cannot be stored - peaks .
New gas-fired plants have already contributed to the UK meeting its targets .
How a Member State meets its obligations is an issue of subsidiarity .
Some of the proposed amendments will be counterproductive .
For that reason , we must thank the rapporteur , Mrs Oomen-Ruijten , sincerely for her hard work .
On the other hand , the use of peat is justified .
The report does not support this objective either , one which is directly linked to the matter of bio-fuels .
This is contained in Amendment No 36 .
We appreciate it very much that Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has agreed to these compromises .
Some amendments will even have a perverse effect .
It is technically feasible but will require the installation of costly end-of-pipe controls .
As noted previously , these additional costs will ultimately be borne in high electricity prices .
Our ecosystem continues to suffer from acidification and eutrophification .
Let me turn to the key issues under discussion .
After a very difficult discussion in the Council , the common position was achieved with unanimity .
Already the common position will reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide from the LCP sector considerably .
Hence there is some merit in tightening emission limit values for nitrogen oxides .
I should like to make a short comment on the other proposed amendments .
Let me assure you that the Commission has considered carefully all the 50 amendments tabled .
Overall we can accept 23 , either fully , in part or in principle .
Thus Amendments Nos 42 , 45 , 46 , 47 and 48 are not acceptable .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
National emission ceilings for pollutants
I hope this position will prove successful tomorrow .
This is to be achieved by setting some interim targets for the year 2010 .
The proposal for a directive also contains the call for a review of the situation in 2004 .
Other causes for concern are industry and traffic .
Member States therefore have to do something about it .
Traffic is a real challenge .
During the discussions at first reading , I already indicated that the line of reasoning was rather weak .
Only with regard to ammonia can I identify with the Council ' s compromise .
That seems highly ambitious to us .
I would like to express my gratitude in this connection .
Thank you , Mr President .
A lot of what was said in the previous debate is of great relevance to this directive too .
Acidification is still a problem to which we cannot avoid drawing attention .
The closer we get to the day of decision , the more afraid some of us seem to become .
Once again , we see the conflict between industry , employment and the environment rear its head .
At Parliament ' s first reading , we supported those emission ceilings proposed by the Commission .
These were not invented figures , plucked out of the air .
Certain people appear now to be denying these figures .
Parliament was right , then , to back the Commission .
But at second reading we are in a rather different position .
It will go no further , it says .
It will not support the amendments tabled by the PPE-DE or the Socialist Group .
I would like Member States to be more ambitious .
So I have accepted that this is as far as we can go for the time being .
It may be that the Commissioner secretly wishes Parliament to pursue its original agenda .
If that proves to be the case then I have misread the game .
There are four polluting substances involved .
The problem of ammonia must be solved at local and national level .
The Gothenburg Protocol has been signed by 36 countries , and is subject to the right of veto .
The common position is hardly more ambitious than the Gothenburg Protocol .
Tomorrow , Parliament has the opportunity to prevent this disgrace .
It is nothing personal .
It is true that it is printed on page 112 of the original proposals .
We showed it to the Belgian members and they did not like the look of that at all .
What about the French , for whom this measure will cost an additional EUR 916 million a year ?
What about the Greeks ?
According to the Commission 's estimate , this will cost them an additional EUR 338 million a year .
So how far are they actually willing to pay the cost ?
Mrs Müller has addressed this problem .
When the Commissioner comes to reply , could she perhaps say something on Amendment No 8 ?
Does subsidiarity apply here or not ?
If it does not apply , then presumably we have to await proposals from the European Commission .
Acidification is therefore a problem ' imported ' into our country .
That is why acid rain causes a lot of damage in Denmark , Sweden and Finland .
I would address all you MEPs from different Member States .
If we are to be able to save the valuable countryside in these areas , we need your help .
I believe that taxation is an issue for the individual nations .
I cannot therefore support the proposal for EU taxes to combat emissions .
I also want to comment on the unemployment argument .
Overall , a good environment and better health do not lead to unemployment .
Effective national emission limits must therefore be set for the main pollutants .
After some long and hard negotiations the Council achieved consensus on national emission ceilings .
The Commission , for its part , supports the Council ' s common position .
The Council ' s common position would mean a significant reduction in emissions .
In this respect I am in agreement with the views expressed earlier by Mr Davies .
It is important that environmental targets are achieved as cost-effectively as possible .
For that reason , Mrs Jackson ' s question is more than justified .
Mr President , I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her work on this important proposal .
We must solve these problems .
Amendments Nos 10 and 13 seek to reinstate the emission ceilings originally proposed by the Commission .
There are different requirements for each Member State and fifteen points of view in the Council .
The Commission therefore does not accept Amendments Nos 10 and 13 .
The Commission can , however , accept Amendments Nos 11 and 12 .
Amendments Nos 11 and 12 explain this very clearly .
That is perhaps important information .
As you know costs were discussed at enormous length in the Council .
They want to look again at the costs in 2004 before signing up to more .
All emissions are not equal because of different weather patterns .
That was also noted in the discussions in Council .
The Commission must therefore reject Amendment No 4 .
We must also look at the effect of aircraft emissions .
We would however prefer to quote Directive 99 / 30 more directly .
We cannot accept Amendment No 5 , nor the first part of Amendment No 7 .
Emissions from international maritime traffic and cruising aircraft cannot be assigned to individual Member States .
The Commission can accept Amendment No 8 in part and in principle .
Again , the Commission cannot accept the requirement to bring forward proposals .
All the issues highlighted by Parliament should be considered during the review .
I thank Parliament for its time and look forward to progress on this very important dossier .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
We were very forceful about that and we tried to persuade the Commission to sympathise with us .
It did not .
We tried to persuade the Council of Ministers to agree with us and it did not .
As I say , the Member States were against this .
This is a situation in which only a minority of Member States are really interested in compliance .
For most it comes very low down on their list of priorities .
So I am afraid we have settled in a sense for second best .
We still have hopes that we will be able to return to this issue .
We do not see how any Member State can possibly oppose that .
Mr President , I should like to begin with a word of gratitude and congratulation to our rapporteur .
Nevertheless , we cannot be satisfied with the joint text .
The European Parliament wanted a binding directive rather than polite recommendations .
The best legislation is worthless if it is not enforced .
This report gave us the opportunity to take some practical action .
Perhaps this was a failing on our part to take some kind of initiative .
So maybe no meeting of minds was possible .
I regard this entire law-making exercise as a failure .
There was simply no proper dialogue between the institutions .
I feel we have let down our constituents across the European Union .
The Liberal Group will be voting against adoption of this recommendation tomorrow .
I just hope we can all do better next time .
We have to concentrate on implementation .
We will put pressure on Member States .
The difference of opinion was on the legal instrument that would best meet the objectives .
It is a good reminder for the Member States .
The amendments will tighten up the requirements in the recommendation .
We now have to ensure that the recommendation is fully implemented .
I should like to acknowledge IMPEL 's role .
The recommendation would now require Member States to report to the Commission on the operation within two years .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Motor vehicle heating systems
Mr President , I should like to begin by pointing out a technical correction .
I would be most grateful if that small technical correction could be made .
I am sure all manufacturers of car heating systems would also be grateful .
There are two further amendments on this .
Both are very technical and have been suggested to me by the industry .
When I looked at them I did not see any problem .
I have submitted them to the committee and it has approved them .
Last month , I moved a report on making buses accessible to disabled people .
Certain people criticised that report because it was far too technical .
I had actually taken a lot of the technicalities out of it .
This is not a job for Parliament .
It is wasting the Commission 's time and it is wasting our time .
I am not an engineer : I was a milkman in my first trade .
I do not know how I am expected to know the difference between 0.5 HPA and 500 HPA .
I make a plea to the Commission that we address this problem .
Hopefully we can get a decent night 's sleep some time in the future .
Perhaps it is because I was an engineer in my previous life .
This is an important directive .
We should not underestimate the importance of it .
Commissioner Liikanen 's services need to make sure that they are sorting out the fine detail .
That is probably right but there are still the political elements that we need to consider .
Then we should not have to be dealing with this sort of technical work .
I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Miller , for his report .
It has been asked why this proposal has been put forward .
The answer is that it is a matter of extending the scope of the directive .
Outsiders might find it difficult to understand why we spend our time on directives like this .
The industry is also supportive as this harmonisation will offer it the benefits of the internal market .
I am therefore pleased that the rapporteur largely agrees with the common position .
He has proposed two technical amendments regarding the specific requirements of combustion heaters .
It will also take into account the implications of the second amendment .
This report will pave the way to a speedy adoption of this directive .
In conclusion , the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1 and 2 .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
The reason , of course , is the lack of knowledge about what can be done .
What is more , there are not enough economic incentives to facilitate investment in more efficient energy use .
One major problem is that energy savings are invisible .
We can , of course , begin with this Parliament .
In my view , the Commission is too cautious in its assessments .
At least 30 % of the energy used today could be saved through rational behaviour .
That is additionally important in the current situation in which electricity markets are being deregulated .
Such a programme would be significantly impaired if the environmental aspects were not covered .
Nor must we forget countries in the vicinity of the EU .
There is therefore every good reason to return to these issues .
The second issue is the protection of resources .
Only 10 % of the oil that is being extracted today was discovered in the last 20 years .
Otherwise our work will merely have been a statistical exercise and an inefficient use of our own energy .
It is imperative that we remove the fiscal , bureaucratic and financial barriers .
For that reason we wish to aim for a reduction in energy intensity .
The political objective for us at the present time is a 2.5 % reduction .
It is also important that the European Commission steps up its coordination effort in this area .
Many programmes are available , but the important thing is to ensure that they are carefully targeted .
My last point concerns public tendering and centralised procurement .
That consensus is leading to the joint initiative he mentioned , which we shall be announcing tomorrow .
This is unusually good working together .
Thank you , too , to the Commissioner , who works within the limits of a very inadequate Treaty .
There is no energy chapter in the Treaty .
That is what disappoints me about this action plan .
It is a piecemeal approach in which the emphasis varies according to the publication .
The case for energy efficiency is clear and unanswerable .
It meets all three requisites of an energy policy : environmental impact , security of supply and competitiveness .
All are helped by energy efficiency .
So if this is so self-evident , the obvious question is why do we need an action plan ?
Why is this not happening automatically ?
We know what the barriers are to accepting such a common sense solution .
Ignorance of the facts , particularly at household and small firm level .
Commissioner , what has happened to the rational planning directive ?
Please bring it forward again .
It has not finished its journey through the legislative process .
Transport is , of course , a particularly difficult area and action is needed .
This action plan of the Commission 's is unambitious .
A 1 % per annum improvement would be very easy to achieve .
We need at least 2.5 % ; that is attainable .
We can look at energy appliances .
However , I am dubious about voluntary agreements .
It is therefore essential that an effective strategy be developed .
In my opinion , the European Parliament also has to act as a model .
Energy efficiency is not just about installing more efficient technology .
It is , above all , a matter of behaviour patterns .
We all agree that it is a good thing .
The challenge lies in persuading members of the public of the need to change their ways .
Above all , we must change attitudes and encourage people to look at the world in a different way .
That is the way forward to achieve energy efficiency .
Mr President , the Commission has given us a good basis for discussion .
The ideas themselves , in fact , are not new .
We have been talking about them for the last ten or fifteen years .
The question is how we can implement it all .
The second problem I should like to address concerns administrative matters .
Some of the university buildings were to be better insulated and have better energy systems installed .
It took many years before the buildings were refurbished .
Because each of them has its own separate accounting system , they did not sit down together .
Absurd it may seem , but that is how things are !
This is a third problem , a question of consumer behaviour .
Consumers bear responsibility too , not only legislators .
It is on this basis that harmonised environmental taxes are justified .
This example of mine is a clear depiction of the distortion of competition .
The special climatic features of Member States have to be taken into account at Community level .
I hope that Mr Rübig ' s amendment will gain support among my colleagues on this basis .
Amongst other things , it proposes decisive action in connection with energy demand .
In addition , it has no effect on energy efficiency .
The Commission may present this directive soon , and I look forward to your contribution to it .
We also intend to put forward a framework directive on electrical equipment in buildings .
On that we are in complete agreement .
Human behaviour is essential .
We must not squander it .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Thank you all for keeping within your allotted speaking times .
Thank you very much .
( The sitting was closed at 11.14 p.m. )
Today alone 1500 EU citizens will die from smoking .
Let us , the European Parliament , lead the way in preventing these deaths .
Thank you , Mrs Stihler .
It has come to my attention that was not the case earlier this week .
I would urge renewed vigour in the application of those rules in this House .
Thank you , Mr Watson .
Madam President , as you know I am a very enthusiastic anti-smoker .
Fine , thank you , Mrs Banotti .
Follow-up to Nice
The entire process must take place with the greatest possible openness .
Our goal is to bring the Union and its institutions closer to its citizens .
It is important that we begin this debate with the factual issues , which our citizens can identify with .
A strong Europe requires strong institutions .
Madam President , we are at the start of an incredibly exciting process .
I look forward to being involved in the debate next week .
What I have talked about so far naturally only concerns the very first initiatives .
The process will continue and the participants will inspire each other .
The internal debate within Parliament will be particularly interesting to follow .
Madam President , what kind of Europe do we , the citizens of Europe , want ?
The question has been asked - let the debate commence !
It is important to remember this even today .
What sort of Europe do we want in the future ?
What do we want to do together ?
What will our plan be ?
Do we want more integration or not ?
Do we or do we not want a more political Europe ?
I will add another question : how do we reform the Community model ?
The second principle is that of proximity .
Such a debate cannot be joined correctly if it is conducted solely from Brussels or Strasbourg .
However , dialogue over the Internet is not enough .
The third principle could be that of anticipation .
After the principles , ladies and gentlemen , we now come to the method .
We know now that this is the only possible method .
We must translate the challenges of the public debate into concrete proposals for the revision of the Treaties .
Having said that , many questions remain open .
What will the decision-making procedures of this body or this future convention be ? What will its composition be ?
Most notably , what place will be reserved for the representatives of the candidate countries ?
What will its mandate be ?
And we ourselves are working on this .
The President-in-Office has said that the debate began on 7 March .
You have produced a shorter letter so that we can understand one other better .
You have launched a website .
If I may be so bold , my Group had already raised the issue on 1 March .
The night before you put very pertinent questions to the parents .
In this instance , I think you were playing with an advantage .
This debate must yield results .
What is unacceptable today will be even more so in the future .
The NGOs , various forums , colleges and universities must also participate .
This is an absolutely decisive question .
We propose an open and transparent method which involves all the participants .
To this end , you can count on our support .
I join you in that .
So please could you let us have your assessment of the pros and cons to which you have referred .
That seems to me to be a contradiction in terms .
I and my group strongly believe that the convention method could be adopted .
This Parliament has a democratic legitimacy .
It is rooted and founded in the European treaties .
We are not a mendicant seeking alms at the European door .
We have a right - in fact a duty - of participation .
Madam President , 2001 is the year of public debate .
The Internet is not enough , Madam President .
More importantly , we are still a long way from a social Europe .
In the final analysis , the governments simply fought to maintain their national right of veto .
Secondly , we need reforms which make the Union truly viable for the future .
It means holding a broad , public , open debate .
We need a different method .
As Members of this Parliament , our duty is not just to speak .
Secondly , we must allow debates to take place at national level and not be afraid of them .
There were very good reasons to look ahead to the next conference .
The people of Europe are not very interested in this kind of debate .
I would be very grateful for an answer to this question .
Madam President , I should like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency on a good home page .
It is splendid to be able to see agendas for meetings in the various working parties .
I would also congratulate the presidency on the Futurum home page initiative .
Madam President , may I begin by welcoming the highly ambitious programme of the Swedish Presidency .
A great deal has already been said and written about the follow-up to Nice .
But there is another aspect of all this which I should like to highlight today .
Madam President , I would firstly like to welcome Mrs Lindh .
You have said that we have to organise the debate .
Of course we do .
How must this be done ?
This Parliament has certain ideas and we are very happy to give them to you .
This debate must have conclusions , which will make up the second phase .
That is what we call the convention method .
I think that it will be very useful to work together on this model .
I believe it is also very important that this model allows for the participation of the candidate countries .
Mrs Lindh , the new IGC is the last thing to be talking about .
The important issue is how to get there .
A new method is vital .
There is a precedent , which is the Convention for the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
We should be writing the answers to the great questions on the future of the Union together .
This morning , 76 citizens from different countries had chosen to take part in the debate .
Of course , this figure could have been considerably higher , but this is a good start .
The speech of the foreign minister indicated that this would not be the case .
Just like us , citizens need to know how these points of view will be channelled .
Subsidiarity is a two-ended concept .
Mr President , I have two things to say .
I am therefore also sceptical regarding the convention method .
My second point concerns content .
In my opinion it is not sufficient to discuss the points stated in Nice .
This is referred to by the polite euphemism of a ' democratic deficit ' .
It is actively anti-democratic .
Against that background , it is , if anything , absurd to attend today ' s debate .
The idea is to establish a democratic dialogue .
This method would be very dangerous .
This would spell disaster for Europe .
However , neither should we have a debate dominated by confusion and disorder .
It is vital that European institutions get this opportunity right .
This morning I looked at the website that the President of the Council mentioned .
It is simply a web page with no facility for citizens to communicate their own views by e-mail .
It is deeply unimpressive and needs to be looked at immediately .
So let us look at the future debate .
First , its nature .
Perhaps this would be a subject for Stockholm : stimulating heads of state to start debates .
Secondly , the breadth .
It must be an event that leads to some form of action .
A true constitutional step forward will be achieved only if such a pluralistic formula is agreed .
Our most pressing task is to found a European democracy .
That is the nub of the discussion and the conflict between us .
The Council failed in Nice in its bid to become Europe ' s constitution-writer .
You were not talking about democracy .
That aside , I should like to use my brief speaking time to make a proposal .
Mr Brok , you now have the floor for two-and-a-half minutes .
Brok ( PPE-DE ) .
( DE ) Mr President , thank you for the warning .
At the same time , I should like to pick up on the question of the timetable .
( Applause )
That is what the citizens expect from you .
Thank you .
I will give an example .
Under the Italian constitution we have a special regime of autonomy .
The debate with the citizens must focus on the central issues of the future in a more flexible Europe .
The presidency gives the impression of seeking to avoid the key issues of the debate on Europe .
This is tantamount to shirking its responsibility to lead Europe .
I agree with you wholeheartedly there .
But actions speak louder than words .
It means more integration , not less integration .
Strong Community institutions : this issue also needs to be specified .
I should like to know what the disadvantages are and for whom .
I was a member of the Charter convention .
I saw no disadvantages .
I saw only advantages .
One last word on the timetable .
I too think that 2004 is wholly inappropriate .
We can wrap this up by the end of 2003 .
Neither is it clear how many MEPs there will be between 2004 and 2009 .
What needs to be done ?
In actual fact , we should already be reaching an interinstitutional agreement on this .
I happen to share Mrs Lynne ' s opinion that the document is sound .
Finally , Madam President , you mentioned citizens .
Madam President , Mrs Lynne mentioned the word ' strong ' .
There must have been eleven socialist governments in Nice .
Well , they were anything but strong on the day .
Let us not beat about the bush .
I would also like to correct an oversight this morning .
This is essential if we want to clear the air for the debate .
It is to them that the Europe of the future belongs .
Let us take note of this .
The experience of the Charter demonstrated this .
I would have welcomed at least a few specifics on the crucial core issues addressed by Michel Barnier .
Do we want a more or a less political Europe ?
How exactly do we envisage fundamental reform of the institutions ?
How should we be organising the process of writing a forward-looking European constitution ?
Perhaps you will yet do so in your closing address .
May I add another question to those already put to you by my fellow Members ?
Some answers please .
But how do they fit in with the facts ?
You were in Nice .
What does the real future look like on paper ?
The loser at Nice was the European Parliament .
Instead of at least more transparency , we ended up with less democracy .
We now have a Europe which looks like the late Habsburg empire in the 19th century .
Now you talk of an open attitude to future procedures .
What is it you really want ?
What is it you stand for ?
Where exactly are you reacting ?
Where do we stand with the Council ?
Do you really find it so hard to shoulder responsibility in front of your voters ?
What is wrong with Sweden ?
I trust that Sweden will yet dare to act .
I am relying on your ambition .
I would like to comment on some of the contributions and begin with the first speaker , Mr Poettering .
Then there is the major question of the next Intergovernmental Conference .
These issues were addressed by the initial speakers .
We cannot reach a final position on this today .
Some have also put forward the disadvantages .
With very many participants , the process can become unwieldy .
We should therefore discuss this properly and in detail .
You played a part in initiating the debate on the future .
Therefore , I think it is important that this also be included as part of the on-going discussion .
Let me now comment on some other issues .
Mr Cox wondered why I said that the Treaties should be simplified without changing the content .
I reply that I was quoting the Nice Decision .
I myself have taken the debate to many Swedish schools .
I presume that you others too have also visited schools .
I recommend that he go and look at it as there are already many contributions there .
This is naturally an important debate for the future .
This site is going through a running-in phase so please show a little understanding .
It was opened barely a week ago .
I think all your comments will help us to turn it into a real website for the people .
Mr Seguro asked a question of the President of the Commission and the Commissioner .
The answer to that , however , is also in the hands of the Heads of State and Government .
It relates to the name of the website www.europa.eu.int / futurum .
Could we find a more user-friendly name , such as hello.com , so that people could access it quickly ?
I admire all the honourable Members with so much time to surf the Net .
Wish that I could do likewise .
Preparatory work for the Stockholm European Council ( 23 / 24 March 2001 )
I shall now give the floor to the President-in-Office of the Council , Mrs Lindh .
Madam President , we have just discussed the future of Europe .
It is really a new Europe , a new Union , which is in the process of being formed .
It is about full employment within the EU .
It is about social and economic reforms .
They are vital to the citizens and thus also for the political legitimacy of the Union .
We need a balance between social and economic reforms .
The work will be carried out both with community law and the new open coordination method .
We must not undermine this process by adding far too many new questions .
We hope that agreement on this will be achieved at the summit .
Opening up product and capital markets is not just an aim in itself .
Thirdly in Stockholm , we must address the demographic development of Europe .
The social insurance systems must make it easier for people to combine work and family life .
You can therefore contact them with your comments .
I would also like to emphasise the importance of the successful development of Economic and Monetary Union .
This is in our common interest .
We assume that the discussion will primarily focus on financial and social issues .
Madam President , employment and welfare are the most important issues for the citizens of Europe .
I look forward to hearing your opinions .
Secondly , it sets specific tasks for the different players to carry out within specific time frames .
Responsibilities and targets are therefore clear and we will be able to measure our progress clearly .
It will become the Commission 's key instrument for coordinating social and economic policy .
Let me say just a little more about these two issues , which I consider to be particularly important .
Firstly : the Community patent .
I repeat : the Lisbon and Feira Councils called for this .
Secondly : the GALILEO programme .
It is an opportunity we simply cannot afford to miss .
The Commission , for its part , will display the necessary flexibility as regards the participation of private capital .
The Lisbon agenda is set against the background of a major challenge : our ageing population .
This also applies to almost all the candidate countries as well as the Member States .
These are stark , statistical facts that we have to take into consideration .
Then we must modernise our welfare and pension systems , making them sustainable in the long term .
The post-war era has brought unprecedented prosperity to all the States of European society .
Today , our societies are - on average - the wealthiest in history .
However , these systems were built on the criteria of expanding or at least stable populations .
We must therefore take action now .
Firstly : intergenerational equity .
The ageing of our societies is placing a substantial extra financial burden on certain generations .
Secondly : the distribution of work .
Not everyone of working age actually works .
This aggravates the long-term strain on the pension systems .
We shall be facing a labour shortage in the Union .
In future , therefore , all generations will have to work longer .
The employment rate for women is only just over 70 % of the employment rate for men .
In short , we need to take ever better care of our increasingly depleted human resources .
Fourthly and lastly : immigration .
This process must be enhanced .
Secondly , we need to bring the single market fully into play with regard to pensions .
However , the Commission is fully committed to bringing the single market into full play here .
We have already tabled a proposal for a directive and I hope the Council will act swiftly on it .
I urge this House and the Council to speed up their work on this plan .
Pension schemes must therefore be made fully portable within the European Union .
Thirdly , it is vital that we address the effects of ageing on public finances .
The effects of ageing on our social systems must reinforce our commitment to reducing public debt .
The interest saved must be used to support pensions and healthcare .
The citizens need time to make provision for their old age .
Action is required now to prevent social systems from losing public credibility .
Indeed , sound public finances must be an integral part of the strategy for sustainable development in Europe .
There is not , and there never will be , one single model of social inclusion in Europe .
Therefore , ladies and gentlemen , my Commission is ready to fully play its part together with you .
Not at all ; just the opposite , in fact !
Has Ireland succeeded through regulation ?
The remedies for improved employment levels are simple .
First of all a discovery : the European Union is not doing too badly .
Of course , unemployment is still too high , but 2.5 million new jobs have been created .
We can do better in many areas .
Deregulation does not mean the lack of regulation .
The new economy has nevertheless experienced problems .
Any new technology is just a tool .
We are not satisfied .
Firstly , structural reforms and liberalisation .
Mr Prodi , I should like to address the following comments to you .
We support this project but we would like to draw your attention to the needs of our citizens .
A genuine project for the 21st century must take on board the real needs of our citizens .
Meeting the needs of our citizens is therefore crucial .
My second comment is about the instruments .
At that time I was very surprised .
Right-wing policy is clearly dominant ahead of the Stockholm Summit .
The focus is on stability policy , liberalisation and deregulation of the internal market .
The social profile is very weak .
One aim is to encourage women to enter the workplace .
This is good .
These are two different things .
My political group considers that this is very serious .
Now , we are heading in the opposite direction .
Right-wing policy is promoted in the EU , and the Swedish welfare policy is at risk .
Time has run out for the Swedish Presidency .
This presents us with two challenges .
Benefits can accrue for business from the use of the Internet and the related e-commerce opportunities .
Parliament has been at the forefront of promoting these measures .
Those who say that it is not must not be listened to .
However promising the results of biotechnology may be , an ethical boundary remains necessary .
Although reproductive cloning is not permitted , research carries on .
I see each new human life as a gift of God .
Every form of human life must be treated with due respect .
That is also the only way to protect human dignity .
Mr President , it is almost impossible to discuss this issue in this arena .
What sanctions do you impose on people sabotaging this system ?
Indeed , the problem does not seem to have been resolved .
Mr President , the Lisbon Process is to create the most dynamic economy in the world .
Sweden has taken part in a number of summits and processes .
In practice , Sweden has done the opposite .
In Stockholm , we must make comparisons and learn from each other .
So how will that work ?
Furthermore , the statistics include a frightening rate of sick leave .
The Lisbon Document talked a great deal about knowledge .
34 % of young people in upper secondary schools lack satisfactory qualifications in mathematics , Swedish and English .
Swedish universities are in crisis .
These guidelines are clear and unequivocal .
They mean investing in people and in their skills and we have good cause to do so .
The record companies and the economy have closed Napster down .
The postal services are one example of just how inefficient Council meetings are .
It was decided in Lisbon to speed up the liberalisation of postal services .
What happened ?
The Council did not adopt a common position .
We should in fact admit to ourselves that the Council does not want to adopt a common position .
Thank you , ladies and gentlemen , for your attention .
Thank you , Mr Jarzembowski .
The debate on this issue is suspended and will be resumed at 3 p.m.
We shall now proceed to the vote .
Mr President , I would like to present the House with a point of order .
At 11.28 this morning we received the following written reply from the services of this House :
Once translated and sent officially to the author you will be sent a copy by e-mail .
Signed : João Correa ' .
How can this happen ?
Is it pure chance that on these two occasions the supposed reply supports the positions of the Spanish Government ?
Does the Spanish Government have a mole somewhere in the Commission or in Parliament ?
I always like hearing about people who are good at their job .
We are able to accept Amendments Nos 39 and 40 .
In addition , Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 5 and 23 are acceptable in principle .
( The President declared the common position approved as amended )
Before the vote :
We are in principle able to accept part of Amendments Nos 3 , 7 , 8 and 9 .
After the vote on Amendment No 13 :
As a result of this , the second part of the Council ' s text remains unchanged .
Given the vote , the outcome is the same .
( The President declared the common position adopted as amended )
Before the vote :
I am glad to see the Scots getting one hundred percent .
( The President declared the common position adopted as amended )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
On Amendment No 16
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
That concludes the vote .
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTEJackson report ( A5-0041 / 2001 )
Mr President , I voted against the Jackson report on the environmental inspections conciliation .
I would not want Europe to suffer the same fate .
Recommendation for second reading Oomen-Ruijten ( A5-0068 / 2001 )
' Who ' s that ? '
I replied .
' It ' s me , don ' t you recognise me ? '
' Me who ? '
' Me , Carlo Fatuzzo !
I ' m Mr Fatuzzo the man . '
' Ah , and you only remember me once a year ? '
Furthermore , significant progress has been made in this area ;
This is why I am voting in favour of this report .
It is down to the European Union to regulate emissions from combustion plants .
Setting ceilings which are too high would reduce to nothing the efforts envisaged to improve the situation .
Recommendation for second reading Myller ( A5-0067 / 2001 )
All Member States have signed the protocol .
In some cases , the emissions ceilings in the protocol are lower than those proposed by the Commission .
Recommendation for Second Reading Miller ( A5-0055 / 2001 )
Korhola report ( A5-0074 / 2001 )
In the ten years since Rio , targets have yet to be reached .
The environment is under enormous pressure .
Poverty is increasing throughout the globe .
The Fifth Environmental Action Programme safeguards people from the adverse effects of air pollution .
Local authorities must also freely give information when requested .
Many of the existing environmental problems are the result of secrecy .
Disclosure could cost them money .
Under pressure from businesses , governments also act mysteriously about their permits and checks .
Environmental problems can only really be solved when there is disclosure at the highest level .
Our citizens across Europe must see that the European Union is transparent , democratic and open .
The internet revolution has transformed the world .
PCs can be found in many households , schools , colleges and offices .
The dot com world is too important to ignore .
Angelilli report ( A5-0070 / 2001 )
I feel the time has come to change that .
Let me end by wishing Mr Fatuzzo a happy birthday .
Nor does anyone dispute the causes of this type of crime .
Even worse , the report makes a scientifically unacceptable correlation between small-scale crime and organised crime .
In organised crime , however , the emphasis is on suppression .
This is an extremely dangerous approach .
For all these reasons , I voted against the report .
We must be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime .
It is not enough for any Member State to work alone in combating crime .
We need to work together with our European neighbours to tackle this issue .
These crime-busting measures must be implemented from Blackburn to Barcelona .
I have had a problem with the courts , a civil case which has dragged on and on .
Bösch report ( A5-0078 / 2001 )
This option would be much more respectful of national wishes .
( Intervention shortened pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure )
I supported the overall impact of the Bösch report .
However , despite these concerns , I have voted in favour of the report and I congratulate the rapporteur .
OLAF is now a reality but we must keep going along this excellent path .
We still have to define certain operating procedures and to guarantee the full independence of the Office .
So we insist that the OLAF reports are sent to the competent committee of the European Parliament .
The credibility and the image of the European Union are at stake .
I fully subscribe to this idea .
The report by Mr Bösch is ambitious , resolute and realistic .
The European Union collects and distributes funding .
It is predictable that such a large-scale and centralised distribution circuit will attract the attention of fraudsters .
If money is doled out , people try to be one of the recipients .
These stockpiles are partly the result of subsidies .
The location of this office in Luxembourg is sensible due to the proximity of the European Court of Justice .
Commissioner Kinnock is leading the way , at the forefront of these reforms in the Commission .
We in the European Parliament should support him in his role .
Wijkman report ( A5-0054 / 2001 )
This should strengthen international competitiveness in the long term .
The economy is based on secure energy supplies .
That concludes the explanations of vote .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.12 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Preparatory work for the Stockholm European Council ( 23 / 24 March 2001 ) ( continuation )
Mr President , I would like to begin by welcoming Mrs Lindh to Parliament .
The Lisbon Summit was held about a year ago .
Everyone , including myself , considers that Lisbon was a major success .
We know that both employment and welfare depend on economic growth .
Social policy is a productive factor .
I have no objections to the factual content , but I find the document unbalanced .
It is particularly important to incorporate the ecological issues .
The Commission likewise condemns the existence of poverty and marginalisation in the Union .
This concerns the right regulatory environment ; colleagues will have copies of the text .
The Commission has not even been able to find one page of good things to say about it !
And why , colleagues , is that ?
Take my own country , which claims to be in the lead of the new economy .
But what did she mention ?
A large number of documents is not necessarily the best guarantee of a future strategy .
I think there is food for thought here .
We are gratified moreover by the adoption of a restricted list of structural indicators .
It is the right course to follow for progress to be made at European level .
Structural reforms must be based first and foremost on the notion of human investment .
Nothing less than that .
This must be clearly reflected in the employment guidelines .
I welcome the interim goals but these must also be included in the economic guidelines .
Secondly : full employment , to us , means quality jobs .
Thirdly : Stockholm must be the summit where quality equals equality .
The Council decided to create the most dynamic economic area in the world .
That was a year ago .
Are we any closer to the plans ?
We have certainly become more competitive , including in new technologies .
The Member States have started on numerous structural reforms .
Unemployment has been reduced to a large - but not by any means full - extent .
Unfortunately , adequate economic and social cohesion between the regions has still not been achieved .
Benchmarking and gender-specific statistics should give us information which needs to be evaluated every year .
That is a very serious issue .
They are paying the price of improved flexibility for enterprises .
Employers have to be made to recognise their responsibilities .
How is that going to promote the e-economy in Europe ?
Without Member State commitment at Stockholm , the knowledge-based economy simply will not happen .
So I say to Member States : " Over to you at Stockholm .
If you want it to happen , put your money where your mouth is " .
We need to speed up the rate of development of the electronic learning sector .
Allow me to comment on some of the issues .
I would like to thank Mr Goebbels for such a positive picture of Europe .
I agree that it is important for us to combine economic and social measures .
That is , in fact , what this whole debate has been about .
Some speakers have talked about economic aspects , others about social aspects .
I cannot understand this .
Obviously , a strong economy is vital for welfare .
I agree with what Mr Andersson , Mrs Van Lancker and Mrs O ' Toole said .
Lifelong learning is an important issue for Europe .
Our citizens must receive sufficient training and so achieve good skills .
Mrs Van Lancker also mentions the position of women in the labour market .
Mr Andersson mentions environmental technology .
All this is vital if we are to achieve our targets regarding competitiveness .
Mr Harbour complained that I did not address the issue of deregulation .
I would like to conclude by thanking you for an excellent debate .
I hope that we will have a good summit in Stockholm .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken on Thursday at 12 noon .
Conflict prevention and crisis management
All three concepts are interconnected .
Hence the high ranking .
We need to do something about improving the European Union ' s information and analysis capacities .
" All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights . "
Now we can show that we are learning from the past .
The EU has a key role to play in this regard .
These are closely linked .
These issues must involve the whole Union and all institutions .
We already know that the EU can make important interventions .
The basic causes of armed conflict must be removed .
Therefore , development work has a key role .
We must also identify potential conflicts at an earlier stage .
The river running through Strasbourg used to be a poisoned watercourse , a barrier .
Now it is a common waterway and source of fish .
The EU must also develop sustainable and effective partnerships with other important players .
The UN is our most important partner .
Similarly , we are strengthening relations with the OSCE .
ECOWAS ' small arms moratorium is a good example .
Partnership with others naturally has to be driven by real needs and comparative benefits .
We are working hard to turn the target of 5 000 police into reality .
Member States have been asked to state their national contributions .
An initial reconciliation will take place in May .
We know that armed conflict damages all vital functions in a society .
She is on her way to Sarajevo and has asked me to stand in for her .
I should like to raise another point in this connection .
This is , I think , an important point .
I think that is an important political point .
If we move in this direction , it will , I think , be a positive development .
I would like to start on a practical note .
This meeting will prove to be of overriding importance .
Needless to say , our Member States are closely involved in this matter .
Europe ' s role in the New York meeting will be of crucial importance .
A number of key points are still missing from the action plan .
It is no longer a question of diplomacy in the traditional meaning of the word .
There is a whole gamut of mechanisms involved .
The crossover between peace and war activities is now difficult to see .
The European Union must be complementary to NATO .
I urge the Council of Ministers and the Commission to comment on that point .
Tackling the root causes is another problem .
Society is seriously destabilised by organised crime .
Capacity building is another critical point .
When we look at Pristina we see that the hospital is under great stress .
I urge the Commission to support those functions .
Finally , of course , accountability .
That underscores the crucial importance of non-military conflict prevention in foreign policy .
The Kosovo crisis showed us that .
Post-war costs rock the EU budget every time .
The example of Kosovo also teaches us that civil conflict management must be deployed early on .
It takes time and it is not very spectacular .
The EU has this potential .
It could play a significant role in preventing and managing conflicts in the world .
European conflict prevention needs a European centre , a Commission and a ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Now , experience has shown us that there are certain problems to be considered .
Our support cannot therefore be total .
We should be alert to situations which may arise tomorrow or the day after .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the events of the last few hours have been most alarming .
Therefore , it is not just a problem of military security at the frontiers .
Commissioner Patten has now taken charge of this case .
This is the situation in Macedonia .
This is the situation we find ourselves in .
For what have we been witnessing in Macedonia for years now ?
This line of thinking shows that the seed of ethnic cleansing had already been planted .
We must avoid going down that road at all cost .
It is important that these are widely known .
However , I cannot hide my true concern .
I am not talking simply of the lack of finances .
In this regard , the European Union is fortunate enough to dispose of quite considerable amounts of funding .
It is obviously a question of using them in a coherent and coordinated fashion .
I am thinking above all of the lack of political support .
What can an international organisation do ?
The war in the Balkans offers sometimes tragic examples of all these shortcomings .
Mr President , conflict prevention has hitherto not been a real priority .
We are looking forward to April .
In the former Yugoslavia , we were unable to prevent conflict for a long time .
And every now and again , conflict prevention ended in disastrous circumstances .
I would refer to the many African examples , and Rwanda , in particular .
They must be able to work proactively and provide for crisis management .
Commissioner , you talk about this entire armed force which will need to be set up .
That is a fertile breeding ground for the illegal arms trade and banditry .
The tragic situation in the Balkans is , I think , proof of this .
We say we are going to improve all this and let us hope that we do .
Today , everything is completely cut and dried .
We do not need any generalisations or insults nor do we need insinuation .
It is that simple .
However conflict resolution and prevention of conflict do require investment .
Some of the causes relating to ethnic and religious origin and so on have already been mentioned .
But there are also economic causes .
You must make peace with your enemy , not with your friend .
There is a saying that opportunity comes to pass , not to pause .
Too often we miss the opportunity to intervene and prevent conflict .
More must be done to protect children .
Troop deployment , as we know , is expensive and very prone to failure .
In Africa , 20 % of the population live in countries affected by armed conflict .
I would be very happy if the Commissioner could look into that .
Are there plans to have a more balanced approach in the early-warning unit ?
I received a negative reply for a relatively long time .
This is perhaps a rather unusual way for a President-in-Office to inform Parliament of something .
If not , I trust that my colleagues in Parliament will seriously address the issue .
Will they stop supporting the secession of Kosovo from Serbia ?
Steps have been taken in this direction in the FYROM .
We have to attack the structural costs of the tensions in advance .
We talk about peace , war and security but we do not know what to do .
And this leitmotiv presented by our diplomats , our generals and our politicians is without substance .
The Commission set this up in 1998 and extended it in 2000 .
I would like to ask the Commissioner if the Commission is satisfied with the work that has been done .
What lessons has it learned ?
What use has it been able to make of these reports ?
I would like to ask the Representative of the Council if the Council knows about this work .
Has it ever , in spite of the Commission ' s bureaucratic oppression , known about this work ?
Has it been of use to you ?
The Commission did not act on this suggestion .
Nor did the Council .
The idea , like the need , is still there .
Does the Commission intend to take it up ?
Has the Council buried it ?
Let us at least try out a new starting point , the sole aim of which is conflict prevention .
For the European Union , what a splendid victory .
This is a fact of life and it makes an excellent contribution to stability in the region .
The common strategies have not always worked in the way that the Council and others had hoped .
I will hand you over to Commissioner Patten to answer this question in more detail .
I would like to respond to four questions which were put during the course of the debate .
We should all denounce it vigorously .
I commend the efforts that the government has made so far .
I hope we can in future .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken at 12 noon on Thursday .
Regulation of European securities markets
All three institutions have a contribution to make here .
We have formulated our proposals on this basis and we expect replies from the Council and the Commission .
There has already been a lot of informal contact between Parliament and the Council regarding this issue .
The Council welcomed the report , but the discussions will continue .
A new ECOFIN Council meeting will take place immediately before the European Council in Stockholm .
The presidency aims to reach an agreement as soon as possible .
The focus is on fully implementing the action plan .
In order to keep to the timetable , we must put in the efforts required now .
I do not wish to comment today on the operational details of the future European Securities Committee .
In this regard , the Council and the European Parliament already follow established rules .
We are all obliged to follow this legal framework .
Therefore the Council believes that there is no need for a further institutional framework in this area .
EU legislation must also be implemented swiftly and consistently , and enforced more rigorously .
Mrs Randzio-Plath has raised five main points on the Commission 's position on the report .
I should like to try to answer all five , although perhaps in a slightly different order .
Let me now turn to the question raised about proposals for implementing measures .
Finally , on this point , there will be a full review of the whole process in 2004 .
The Commission believes that substantial long-term benefits will flow from that objective .
All interested parties will have to be satisfied and have an adequate role within the limits of the Treaty .
That is an important safeguard for Parliament to see that it is not bypassed by any sleight-of-hand .
So , there again , we can reassure Mrs Randzio-Plath .
That goes without saying .
I should like to say a word on the question of whether democracy costs time .
I cannot agree with that .
There are quite specific examples of this , such as the product liability directive .
This too is a unanimous call and will shortly be adopted in the resolution .
Why , then , mobilise Secretaries of State for ostensibly technical rules ?
What is more , these Secretaries of State must vote according to Council rules .
Mr von Wogau has pointed out a few ways to achieve this . I will not repeat them .
The Parliament wants a right to recall , which exists in many countries and also in the United States .
I want to come to the nub of the issue here before us .
Yes , we have rights in the primary legislation .
But there is a feedback system in this .
Will we give them a millimetre or a metre ?
A metre or a kilometre ?
No callback - no wide latitude .
We have a big choice to make .
What are we pursuing here ? It is not simply a closed loop .
Let me turn to the bit of the debate that has not mentioned its name .
This is not acceptable .
There should be not two rules but one rule , one democracy , one openness .
However , who can say that we are actually preparing that ?
It is not the European Parliament that is slowing things down .
They have not developed a strategy and have come up against a great deal of administrative opposition .
We demand that this challenge be brought within reach of public opinion .
Once again , it is a question of democratic choice .
The next item is the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council on foot-and-mouth disease .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , foot-and-mouth disease is a terrible disease .
It is immensely infectious and deadly . It also causes major financial damage and great suffering .
On 20 February this year , an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease was identified in the UK .
An exception to this decision allows transportation directly to an abattoir .
Measures have been taken there similar to those taken in the UK .
The Commission adopted a safeguard decision the following day , 21 February .
Since then further measures have been introduced to ban movements of livestock throughout the European Union .
It must also be viewed in the context of the continued increase in cases in the United Kingdom .
Any expectation that the crisis would end quickly have been disappointed .
Clearly we need to be very concerned at the progress of the outbreak .
Three factors in particular are disturbing .
It is clearly disappointing that expectations that the incidence of the disease would shortly peak have not been realised .
I would hope that this greater good is not lost sight of in the present crisis .
This discovery dashes our hopes that the disease could be confined to the UK .
These measures , wrongly viewed as excessive by some , have proved to be very prudent .
I was reassured by the Secretary that these measures will be reviewed urgently .
We have agreed that our respective veterinary services should cooperate urgently on finding solutions .
Beef imports have been permitted from Argentina despite its regional problems with foot-and-mouth disease .
This was , of course , subject to very strict controls .
There is no consumer risk .
Are you satisfied with the veterinary capability to handle this crisis , particularly in the United Kingdom ?
Are you satisfied that the Standing Veterinary Council is up to the job ?
We have brought the Irish community to a standstill .
The EU reaction has been inadequate and slow .
The disease is out of control in Britain and has now spread to continental Europe .
They have explained the situation in England .
It is time we got our act together and lessons should be learned from the BSE crisis .
We need more details from Argentina .
Nonetheless , I too want to express my determination not to succumb to panic .
How did this virus get to Europe from Asia ?
Has the story of the on-board meals of an airline company been adequately explained ?
Nevertheless , I wonder whether that was enough .
I paid a visit to the United States not so long ago .
All this to check whether any contagious diseases are being imported into the United States .
This does not happen in Europe .
The debate whether or not to vaccinate is once again upon us .
We must know how much it will cost .
This Parliament has increased the budget line for " SOS countryside " over the past six years .
Last year , the Commission refused to implement this budget line .
It pays for a telephone line which can be used by any farmer across the European Union .
This is about a clear-cut wish from Parliament and I think that it is extremely well-timed .
This proves that this crisis is , first and foremost , of a commercial nature .
Let us stop seeing it as a health crisis .
Let us stop mixing up the issues .
Commissioner , what has happened to the tests ?
What has happened to the controls on meat and bone meal ?
These are questions which must be tackled alongside this crisis .
Secondly , you are corrupting the precautionary principle .
I am telling you this very politely as an ecologist .
What is more , healthy animals can recover from foot-and-mouth disease .
But it is not worthwhile commercially .
So get things into perspective and propose valid solutions .
Yes , you are slaughtering animals .
The priority is to get out of the crisis .
It is not enough !
Eight hours is too long to transport live animals !
A stop must be put to this system .
We must turn our backs on intensive and battery farming .
Adopt long-term measures to put an end to this atrocious form of production and to return to extensive farming .
Mr President , we are facing a problem which is very likely to become explosive .
We are facing an extremely virulent strain and the environmental conditions lead us to fear the worst .
Allow me to make three observations .
Secondly , Commissioner , is there going to be compensation for farmers as a result of this horrendous crisis ?
Where will the money come from ?
A third and final observation .
The financial implications are considerable .
Let us not underestimate the social consequences of this catastrophe .
I acknowledge that for the British Government the situation is difficult .
However , there is nothing to be gained at this stage by apportioning blame .
I certainly sympathise with the plight of British farmers .
I compliment Commissioner Byrne on his measured and positive response to the crisis .
The work and guidance of the Standing Veterinary Committee is , of course , important in this regard .
The first error is the ideology of globalisation , which Mrs Auroi spoke about .
When everything is allowed to move around freely , even the foot-and-mouth virus moves around freely .
The second error is the race to achieve profitability .
The third error is that of immigration .
The fourth error is that of the race for profits .
The United States and Canada have just closed their borders , placing our farmers in a very difficult situation .
Our farmers have been ground down and we must help them .
Foot-and-mouth - because it is such a highly infectious disease - is the last straw .
First : do you know the exact extent of the epidemic at the latest count ?
Secondly : farmers are anxious to know if the foot-and-mouth vaccination has been abolished once and for all .
Thirdly : transportation is once again centre stage .
Is the transportation of animals and meat within the European Parliament being jointly controlled ?
And if so , how ?
What sanctions are to be applied in the event of infringement ?
That is something at least .
But , as you said , they have foot-and-mouth disease .
What specific protection and what safety measures have you introduced here , Commissioner ?
Who pays what and what funds do you think the EU should provide ?
For me this means that the Commission itself should take action as well as coordinating national measures .
The Union can play an important role in helping to rebuild those economies .
Mr President , a thorough investigation is certainly required into the implications of the foot-and-mouth outbreak .
Many considerations arise .
The closure of small abattoirs again needs to be reviewed .
Consequential loss is not covered when discussing the issue of compensation .
In the past it has not bothered to take this .
Has it taken advantage of this for this current national tragedy ?
Mrs Doyle said that it was a crisis .
Our minister said on television three days ago that it is under control .
Could the Commission tell me whether it is under control ?
Could I also ask what the EU is doing ?
Has the veterinary advice been coordinated ?
Is it safe to transport infected carcasses across the United Kingdom as we are doing at the moment ?
It has also been repeated that this is not a human health crisis .
Also , the farming sector is not the only victim of this crisis .
Are you prepared to increase aid measures in all the countries of the European Union ?
What do the European institutions think of wide-scale vaccinations ?
What position will you adopt in relation to third countries ?
What is going to happen with regard to wild animals , Commissioner ?
What will happen if deer , wild boar or goats are affected ?
A number of different issues were raised .
So to identify trade as being the cause of this is , in my opinion , a simplistic response .
Foot-and-mouth disease is endemic in the developing world .
The EU has a huge trade surplus in food and agricultural products .
So do we wish to surrender the resulting benefits ?
This is an important issue .
We must not lose sight of that .
The other route is the better one .
Intensive farming is another issue that was raised .
I should repeat that the foot-and-mouth disease is endemic in the developing world .
That is an important issue to be taken into account .
There farming is at its most intensive .
Transport was another issue that was raised .
The restrictions on animal movement will minimise the risk of transmission of the disease .
This will , in turn , eventually ensure that the outbreak is brought under control .
It remains to be seen , however , how long this will take .
A lot depends on the amount of trade that took place before we first knew about this outbreak .
I must stress this .
A number of people have asked why the Commission does not bring forward more proposals .
That is always the standard response when something happens .
The legislation is there .
Controls and enforcement are important .
We must not lose sight of that .
I hope I have dealt with most of the issues you have raised .
Thank you very much , Mr Byrne , for replying so concisely .
You have stood by your word .
The debate is closed .
Question Time ( Council )
Question No 2 by ( H-0141 / 01 ) :
The importance of really reaching out to our citizens cannot be stressed enough .
However , we cannot allow ourselves to be discouraged by this .
I would like to remind you of the possibility of holding public Council debates .
Debates from the European Parliament plenary sessions are regularly broadcast live by satellite across Europe .
What remains is to ensure that the broadcasts reach the widest possible audience .
In other words - no , but it was a very nicely wrapped-up reply .
If you think of the way that President Clinton did it , it is not the same thing .
Mr President , I had the first question .
Mr Alavanos , I am as sorry as you are that your question has lapsed .
The time that the debate begins does not depend on my will .
As all the Members have heard , I have apologised and I regret the situation .
I hope that it does not happen again .
Question No 3 by ( H-0229 / 01 ) :
As democratically elected Members of the European Parliament , we continually meet members of the public in our constituencies .
We are also trying to make press conferences and press releases increasingly informative .
This decision will enter into force on 1 May 2001 .
So a great deal is being done .
I would like to thank the Council for that answer .
We are in complete agreement on this .
Debates can be followed live not only on TV , but via the Internet too .
This is my counsel to the Council .
Do you think this might be something for the Swedish Presidency to focus on after the Lisbon Summit ?
However , we will not have reached that position by 19 March , which I freely admit .
Question No 4 by ( H-0145 / 01 ) :
I think I have probably already answered the additional question posed by Mr Sjöstedt .
This is the question to which I would like a specific answer .
Should the nationality be stated , yes or no ?
I think that I have been quite clear .
It does not fall within the scope of the presidency to do that .
This is , however , a discussion which should be pursued outside this Parliament .
As they deal with the same subject , Questions Nos 5 and 6 will be taken together .
Question No 5 by ( H-0147 / 01 ) :
Question No 6 by ( H-0156 / 01 ) :
One of the cornerstones of the Swedish Presidency is environmental issues .
This exercise has already started , and Parliament will be informed as soon as possible .
The conclusions from the Council ( General Affairs ) will also be tabled during the spring .
Together with all of the contributions , the document will be tabled at the summit in Gothenburg .
However , allow me to look into this and come back to you with a more precise reply .
The question of evaluation mechanisms in the integrated strategy is extremely important and relevant .
We expect great things of you which is why we ask a lot .
It is easier in certain areas .
Question No 7 by ( H-0150 / 01 ) :
This is a body of the Council ; it is a body which was created within the Council .
As it is a body of the European Union , these criteria are common to all Member States .
What are the criteria for the morality of candidates who will have to occupy this post ?
Opinions may differ on whether or not it would be desirable to have common criteria .
As has just been explained , this issue falls under the jurisdiction of national governments .
What do you think ?
Was the Commission ' s reply wrong ?
How will they travel and how will they prove that they belong to a Member State ?
Perhaps you can advise me .
Question No 10 by ( H-0159 / 01 ) :
America has , in its most recent statements , confirmed its commitment in this respect .
The European Union also emphasised that it wants to keep this treaty .
Has the Council no position at all on this ?
And that is something I am still looking for .
One of these issues is precisely this question of National Missile Defence .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.20 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
Regulation of European securities markets ( continuation )
The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on the following oral questions :
I know it is appreciated by all my colleagues .
Sadly , this remains an aspiration rather than a reality .
Both of these will be helped by Mr Lamfalussy 's proposals , which are sensible and pragmatic .
In short , we have a legislative problem .
The solution lies in creating a clear legislative procedure which allows Parliament to effectively exercise its powers .
Parliament alone cannot be blamed for the present system ' s shortcomings , however .
The bosses do not do the work of the secretaries , and vice versa .
To begin with I should like to answer some of the points that were raised this afternoon .
I would agree with him in his sentiment .
However , certain articles in the Treaty concerning the internal market mention directives and not regulations .
Mr Goebbels asked if the new procedures would speed up legislation .
As I have explained , they would .
Mr Goebbels then asked whether the Securities Committee would consist of Secretaries of State .
I am afraid I cannot answer that question .
So I cannot comment on that .
As I said , Member States will nominate their own representatives .
The Commission wholeheartedly endorses that .
The procedures set out in this report are not intergovernmental .
So it is not an intergovernmental committee .
Let me now answer a few points that were raised this evening .
Normally there is a government and a parliament .
The fact that there are 15 Member States further complicates the procedure .
Indeed there was a committee , the Lamfalussy committee .
That is a purpose I share .
I must say , however , that the matter of secondary legislation is a very important one .
There is no provision in the Treaty for dealing with secondary legislation in this way .
The Commission is grateful for the support Mrs Kauppi has given to the report of the Lamfalussy committee .
There is no difference of opinion .
She want speedier legislation .
She is right .
The Commission wants it , Mrs Randzio-Plath wants it , everybody wants it .
Therefore we cannot see our way to granting Parliament a callback possibility .
Firstly , the Commission will take full account of a resolution approved by Parliament .
That is the second point .
The Commission knows that .
So why should the Commission frustrate the wishes of Parliament by doing something that is not really proper ?
That is the third point .
Again , the Commission would take full account of that opinion and reconsider the whole proposal .
The Commission cannot and will not do so .
Therefore , I do not think there are any grounds for wanting a callback possibility .
I cannot speak for the Council .
The Council proceedings are not open and therefore it is very difficult to comment .
After all , a single majority vote is almost never mentioned in the Treaty .
We know what unanimous votes are and we know what qualified majority votes are .
Mr President , Commissioner , you have referred to numerous possibilities and impossibilities .
No one wants to change the Treaty just now .
Mrs Randzio-Plath referred this afternoon to a callback procedure or equivalent measure , or words to that effect .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
He himself explained why during his intervention on the Lamfalussy report .
May I apologise on his behalf once again .
I shall endeavour to do my best under the circumstances .
So much for the pros .
The second factor is the slowdown in the European economy .
According to forecasts , the average rate of growth will be 2.8 % .
We must be critical of the fact that consolidation efforts have come to a standstill in numerous countries .
We also have a few demands .
We need to step up efforts in education and training .
Our citizens will finally hold it in their hands .
Growth and investment forecasts are being revised downwards everywhere .
There is the threat of weakening exports and increasing problems in funding social security systems .
The euphoria over the new economy has fallen into the abyss along with the fall in share prices .
Today it would appear that the old economy is not so old after all .
We must take strategic precautions : economic policy , monetary policy and social policy must be coordinated .
We must improve the framework conditions for innovative start ups .
We must make it easier to invest in information and communications technologies .
We in the PPE-DE Group agreed with him unanimously .
The social market economy is more than just an economic model .
But that is by the by .
Our rapporteur insists on the technological aspects of economic superiority .
We must protect ourselves from the extremes of a non-social economy .
Mr President , it is true that the European economy appears to have grown quite solidly over recent years .
So then the basic principle reads : a weak euro is bad for the European economy .
This illustrates the absurdity of reducing economic policy measures to fiscal policy .
It is true that the number of unemployed has fallen over recent years .
It is true that investments have increased over recent years .
What has all this to do with a forward-looking economic policy ?
The von Wogau report must be rejected .
But we must admit that we did in fact expect more .
Mr President , we are not having a very lively debate .
The impression we are giving is that the European Union is very passive .
Allow me to make three observations .
We are lamentably lacking initiatives to consolidate the potential and perhaps real growth of the European Union .
Secondly , we have said that the social policy was necessary to consolidate growth .
Thirdly , we talk about an acceleration of balanced liberalisation .
The debate between competition and service of general interest has only just started .
Here too , we lack initiatives .
I hope that the next few months will prove me wrong .
This is patently a key point .
Structural reforms are regularly mentioned .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Swaps arrangements and forward rate agreements
I hope these amendments are supported tomorrow by the other political groups .
It is of great importance that information on the Member States ' accounts is comparable .
Comparison of this information is one of the prerequisites for economic coordination in the Union .
The differing statistics on unemployment are one of the best-known examples .
It also renders cooperation difficult .
Transparency is all we demand in Parliament .
The Commission proposal initially gave rise to concerns in the Council working group .
The technical nature of this issue should make this possible .
We are not talking about deliberate , statistical lies .
We are simply talking about applying different criteria to different objectives .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
EU election assistance and observation
In what way ?
A consistent political strategy is necessary .
Another fundamental point is the need for institutional coordination between the European Parliament , the Commission and the Council .
Flexibility is definitely needed in the evaluation standards .
Moreover , strategy consists of rules and objectives .
Mr President , I will begin by endorsing what my colleague Mr Fava has said .
Throughout our negotiations on this issue we have had very good cooperation .
This is the strong emphasis in the report that we are looking at this evening .
The sending of observers is therefore very useful , but can also entail risks .
Observers can be manipulated and played off against each other .
They can be used as alibis to legitimise a regime which has gained power via unlawful means .
There is still too much improvisation going on at the moment .
A compulsory brief beforehand is therefore a minimum requirement .
It is also necessary for the different observation teams to work together more closely .
Too often , observers arrive late and leave early .
A small nucleus of long-term observers may be able to offer a solution here .
The mission must , at all times , act independently and be seen to do so .
I was fortunate that this was my experience in Sri Lanka .
The communication was designed to boost our performance in this whole area .
Wheels were too often reinvented and roles too often confused .
I would like in particular to comment on a few issues raised by the report .
We cannot and should not observe or support every election .
So prioritisation is essential and Parliament should contribute to this .
Such missions will determine the nature of our observation .
The Commission is not interested in election tourism .
The core mission must be experienced and have appropriate technical expertise .
The involvement of members of this House in electoral observation missions plainly makes considerable sense .
Mrs Kinnock asked how we intended to pursue this work in the Commission .
The visibility of European Union action is important .
The best visibility is obtained by running an effective and professional operation .
Sustainability is important too .
Parliament 's report deals with a hugely important subject .
Common strategy on Ukraine
Ukraine , however , is very different from Russia .
It has a major strategic importance both for Russia and the West .
Ukraine is split internally .
Ukraine now clearly orientates itself towards Europe .
We have to encourage and support the country in this .
I have tried in my report to place Ukraine in a wider pan-European context .
My basic reason for this was the views adopted in Elmar Brok ' s report on enlargement .
These paragraphs are , to some extent , open to interpretation .
The 21 paragraphs of the draft contained everything that was essential , in my view .
Mr President , I very much welcome this balanced and thoughtful report .
It is a report which is very well worth reading .
More recently my visits have largely centred on nuclear issues .
Ukraine has not found the transition to a market economy an easy process .
They have yet to bring their regulatory and financial structures closer to our own .
Privatisation goes ahead slowly .
But we should look upon these efforts in positive terms and with understanding .
It is almost impossible to talk about Ukraine without reference to nuclear power .
The latter are the two sites where reactors are now being completed to western safety standards .
Our financial support should encompass the whole sector .
That is the good news .
That is a difficult , but not impossible task .
If we are critical , we are so in the interest of Ukraine .
Our demands of that country should be the government ' s own .
This includes , among other things , the investigation into the murder of journalist Gongadze .
That is the bad news .
The explosive situation in Ukraine makes this report very much one of its time .
There are also problems there with the implementation of a market economy .
This is something the rapporteur also referred to in his speech .
At present the plans for , and implementation of , these networks stop at the Ukrainian border .
But then Ukraine must not become the atomic dump of Europe !
Mr President , the current political unrest in Ukraine is extremely ill-timed .
This on-going scandal is also affecting the European Union .
And there is no sign of that yet , claims Mr Väyrynen , and rightly so .
In fact , the political pandemonium surrounding the sinister Gongadze affair has widened the chasm between Ukraine and Europe .
What can , and should , Europe do about this depressing state of affairs ?
The Väyrynen report manages to illustrate this in a realistic manner .
It is so important now for the European Union to improve the focus and implementation of its strategy .
Let me touch very briefly on one very specific aspect : the issue of anti-personnel landmines .
The Ottawa Convention places an obligation to destroy stocks of APL .
We should expect Ukraine to take action .
Ukraine was not one of them .
This is a huge problem , which is why we need a new concept .
What sort of concept do I mean ?
Ukraine will soon be a neighbour of the EU .
Mr Väyrynen 's report deals with our immediate neighbours once the EU is enlarged .
Can we isolate one country , but not the other ?
This is a good report .
I congratulate the rapporteur .
The current events there are of deep concern to all of us .
Ukraine wants to draw closer to the European Union and its neighbours .
We welcome that .
Several Members have referred to the Gongadze case .
I was part of that troika delegation .
I can assure Parliament that we made our position abundantly clear .
It will organise a seminar on independent media in Kiev .
We are also ready to provide technical assistance .
They make clear how far there still is to go .
In Ukraine the private sector still accounts for less than a quarter of GDP .
The report has proposed enhanced attention to certain activities .
Mr Van Orden referred to the stockpile of anti-personnel landmines in Ukraine .
The point he makes is entirely valid .
I congratulate the honourable Member on his report .
I rather sympathise with his view .
He has written an excellent report and our relationship with the Ukraine will benefit from his wise advice .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Patten .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday , at 12 noon .
Organisation and management of the Internet - Policy issues 1998 - 2000
Rather , the Commission is called upon to work alongside the US Government .
It gets to the heart of the matter .
The other important issue is the role of public authorities .
It has been the responsibility of a series of groups of experts .
It is very much governed by the individuals and users who are operating the system .
But we should not do that .
Domain names have also proved to be valuable commodities .
Will the WIPO alone have jurisdiction here or is this already a matter for the WTO ?
Companies ' profits can dive if a letter or dot is put in the wrong place .
This is a peculiar combination !
Recently there was a vote to increase the Board of Directors to nineteen members .
Of the three billion of those entitled to vote in the network vote , just seventy-six thousand did .
It is a strange game !
This is an incredibly undemocratic system in an incredibly important role .
The Commission has quite rightly taken action , and so it must .
But we need something more .
Has the putting of the domain names .bytes , .info and .pro into use been delayed ?
Is it true that a Norwegian company has got the top domain name ?
Even Mr Paasilinna said that there could be cause for criticism in this area .
I also wonder what allies the Commission had in Melbourne .
Did we have any representatives at the meeting ?
How representative can ICANN be considered to be ?
The same question was asked by Mr Paasilinna .
We therefore have good reason to be self-critical .
We need to work more quickly .
I am extremely grateful that the Commission and other Member States want to raise this serious issue in Stockholm .
What does that word evoke ?
He was Genoese , not Portuguese .
We simply do not take time to stop and think about it .
A few technical points have been addressed .
At the same time I wish to thank the members of Parliament for this debate .
For that reason I congratulate you : you are an avant-garde group in this field .
The Commission and the Member States are involved in large-scale programmes of cooperation in this area .
Last October , the Council of Ministers passed a resolution on this issue .
But we have to recognise that we have not yet achieved this aim .
Many European organisations and companies were represented at the meeting this week in Melbourne .
The Commission obviously cannot do everything on its own .
Thank you all once again !
Work of ACP / EU Assembly ( 2000 )
The catalogue of events is described in some detail in the report .
I would ask you to vote in favour of the former .
It does not hold us to anything and does provide a range of interesting ideas .
And yes , I will be donning a red plastic nose in common with everyone else .
Mr President , the Cotonou Agreement establishes the parliamentary dimension of the Joint Assembly .
The very structure of this Assembly is therefore unbalanced .
We will therefore vote for the report by Mr Martínez Martínez with conviction because it highlights these shortcomings .
The past year has been a watershed for the ACP / EU partnership .
There was a lot of resistance about going to Abuja , in Nigeria last year .
That turned out to be one of the best Assemblies we have ever had .
We have built many of Mr Martínez Martínez 's ideas into the new rules .
We are now a parliamentary assembly .
We can involve civil society - this is desperately important .
I want to see standing committees that do real work rather than the workshops that we have .
The Commission clearly supports the Assembly 's wish to take on a more politically ambitious role .
This is a meaningful and necessary meeting-place between North and South in the world .
As Europeans we can be proud that we are able to play this role .
I am looking forward to the cooperation within this framework .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Nielson .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday , at 12 noon .
( The sitting was closed at 12 midnight )
I do not need to detain the House with a lot of the technical details relating to those texts .
Lord Inglewood has taken soundings of the industry .
I commend this report as a good example of that process .
( Loud applause )
A purely recodified text would have included a considerable number of repetitions , inconsistencies and obsolete provisions .
It is an example of efficiency which Parliament may well want to adopt in other instances as well .
That would be a very good example of a fast-track procedure .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken today at noon .
The next item is the following oral questions to the Commission :
B5-0015 / 2001 by Mr de Roo and others , on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group ,
B5-0020 / 2001 by Mrs Grossetête and Mr Moreira Da Silvara , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group ,
B5-0153 / 2001 by Mr Olsson , on behalf of the ELDR Group ,
B5-0154 / 2001 by Mrs González Álvarez , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group ,
on water management in Europe .
This sound ecological principle is enshrined in European law .
The Spanish government tried in vain to block this framework directive on water because of its National Hydrological Plan .
It contravenes the habitat directive on 82 counts and the birds directive on 108 counts .
However , there are alternatives !
Israel provides a good example of this .
Surely it cannot be that the European Commission as the Guardian of the Treaties is operating a double standard ?
Does the Commission approve of 60 villages in Spain being wiped off the map ?
Almost three years after the vote on this resolution , questions are still being asked .
Basically , the European Union has no experience at all in establishing such networks .
To this day , information on possible conclusions of these studies has not been passed on to us .
It is also important to bear in mind the irreversible nature of any projects that might be undertaken .
It is hard to imagine these facilities being challenged in the short or medium term .
And this is where this plan enters into a European dimension .
We do not understand the resistance against limiting transfers between basins , while maintaining State borders .
These four directives are now the backbone of the forthcoming sixth environment action programme .
It applies the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle .
The directive does not prohibit water transfers per se .
However it imposes a binding legal requirement that they should not harm the environment .
The possibilities for derogation are restricted and subject to mandatory conditions .
Mr President , may I introduce a further thought ?
A second step must then be to increase value added through exports .
Everyone would gain from that .
Municipalities and consumers would save on costs .
Producers would find new markets .
I would like to ask Mr Liikanen to clarify this on behalf of Mrs Wallström .
I ask you please , Mrs García-Orcoyen , not to say something that is not true .
Would you like an example ?
We strongly doubt that this reduction is a counter-proposal .
Any water plan should be more than a series of infrastructures and transfers .
Ladies and gentlemen , the best reservoir is saving .
We have the opportunity to draw up a sustainable , innovative and model plan .
Now , more than ever , we can ' t please everyone .
Water is a product that is essential to life itself .
It should be understood that Portugal has indeed played this active role .
We can also be sure that we are far from paying the subject the attention it deserves .
The prospects in this sector are tremendous .
We must stop that before it happens .
No one can deny this , much less so the Partido Popular or the Spanish Government .
You could have put the question more directly from the start .
First of all , I would like to know if you have read it .
I never said anything else , Mrs Sornosa .
There has also been talk in this debate about the matter of alternative plans and desalination plants .
Unfortunately , I cannot answer all of that in detail due to lack of time .
But it is first and foremost , of course , something that must be decided in Spain itself .
Personally , I would be very reluctant to privatise water .
It would raise problems with far-reaching constitutional consequences for our Member States .
It is something we surely do not want .
Mr President , I just wish to clarify a couple of points .
The debate is closed .
Mr President , we live in exciting times .
Biotechnology is yet another of these industries .
We ignore or side-step it at our peril .
We signal this need in the report and take no predetermined position .
This is for later , after proper debate .
It will use fewer pesticides and herbicides and therefore improve the environment and natural habitats .
There is no time to lose if Europe is to take its proper place .
We have the scientists , the research establishments and the scientific capability .
We have the basis of a successful industry , with entrepreneurs , investors and business managers .
Our scientists and entrepreneurs are watching intently .
I ask my colleagues in Parliament to give this report their full support .
I ask the Commission to respond to it with vigour , determination and singleness of purpose .
Biotechnology could have immense importance for regional policy .
It offers opportunities for regions where natural conditions are harsh .
This also applies to the situation in the developing countries .
Farmers may become dependent on large , multinational companies in the processing industry .
It will be very important to guarantee competition .
Mr President , just as the rapporteur points out , biotechnology offers enormous opportunities for good .
However , biotechnology also raises a series of new and very difficult issues to which we must respond .
The opinion of the Committee on the Environment indicates some key areas .
There must also be public control of the research .
We still do not have the necessary regulations on labelling , traceability and responsibility .
That would lead , of course , to an increase in social inequality .
We note that biotechnology is unable to develop that great potential particularly well in Europe .
There are a number of hindrances to it in the European Union .
This arrangement was a problem from the start .
It is particularly harmful to small and medium-sized enterprises that are unable to transfer their work abroad .
We have good rules for release and we can therefore end the moratorium now .
I believe the dangers of green gene technology are much overstated .
There is room for improvement there .
I also believe that we must set ethically-based limits for gene technology and biotechnology .
Mr President , this report should be welcomed for its well-rounded approach .
But it is not all about growth .
Long life and a healthy life have to be earned .
The region that I represent has the lowest GDP per head of any region in the United Kingdom .
We call it Bio-Science-North .
The final point I would like to make is that we must reinforce the environmental possibilities of biotechnology .
For that reason we shall support Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 25 and 27 .
I am glad that the Dutch Prime Minister has realised this .
The manipulation of nature must be approached in a more careful way than that which Mr Purvis is proposing .
The IT stock market bubble has now burst .
However , I have a number of peripheral comments to make .
Unfortunately , the rapporteur imputes an exemplary function to the United States .
Information on biotechnology should also reflect an even-handed balance .
Leaving it to the sector leads to an entanglement of ethics and economic interests .
Ethical decisions should be taken as close as possible to the level of the citizen .
That also applies to the direction of development in biotechnology .
The Netherlands and Great Britain have appealed to the Court and it is better to wait for the judgment .
Politicians remain responsible for the decisions .
It is unclear for what reason this industrial sector deserves to receive support .
Because of the above misgivings , I am unable to support the report .
Economic motives must not dominate moral considerations .
Mr President , Mr Purvis has done a good job as several speakers have already said .
I think it is a good report .
Imagine if we could understand how algae produce oxygen from sunlight .
Such things exist .
We could imitate it .
It would transform our energy industry completely .
To understand that , for example , is an enormous challenge .
Or look at a sea urchin ' s spine under the microscope .
You get a fantastic picture of how new materials might be built .
To understand how that is made could dramatically change our industrial culture .
That is John Purvis ' message and I would like to endorse it .
That is Cuba .
I only want to mention that because other countries are named here .
That is also something we need to understand .
Then what we have been doing hitherto will perhaps one day be seen as an aberration .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Purvis 's report is an excellent document .
Biotechnology offers great opportunities , but also considerable risks .
We live in a democracy .
That means that our citizens ' fears and anxieties must be taken seriously .
We can only succeed in doing this through debate and by making information easily accessible .
We are told that we can reduce the number of pesticides used in farming .
We must have a truthful and open-minded attitude both to opportunities and difficulties .
Responsible and informed freedom of choice is fundamental to a democracy .
Used properly , biotechnology can contribute to ecological , economic and social growth .
Used improperly , it can , like any other technology , be dangerous .
It is supposed to heal diseases , solve the problem of world hunger and create better people .
What have we seen in that time ?
It is a question of distribution .
This is shown not least by the very large majority in support of the report in committee .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
I would like to make just two points . The first relates to drug patenting .
My second point relates to patents on genetic discoveries .
In any case , we must put an end to the ' patenting of life forms ' .
Mr Purvis quite rightly emphasises all these developments .
I do , therefore , find the report is too partial by far and is even prejudiced .
It disregards the concerns that were even expressed in this House on GMOs .
It questions the moratorium imposed by several Member States , one of which was France .
I agree with what my fellow Member has just said .
It is preparing a strategic communication on biotechnology to be completed by the end of 2001 .
Mr President , the report of Mr Purvis on biotechnology comes at just the right moment .
Europe is lagging behind the rest of the world and threatens to miss opportunities .
As Mr Purvis makes clear , it is a vital industry for the future of the European Union .
If we are going to benefit from the biotechnology industry , we need to nurture the industry .
The BSE and foot-and-mouth crises indicate a lack of confidence .
It is also clear that there is an ethical dimension .
We need public accountability and clear guidelines that command public support .
Genetic engineering applications will play a key role .
I would like to thank Mr Purvis sincerely .
We must now at last give the green light to green genetic engineering .
The advantages are tangible and easy to understand .
We must also show the red card to extremists .
Biotechnology and gene technology must cease to be the poor relation .
Undertakings , and with them jobs , are leaving Europe .
In my view , the lights are on amber here .
They must be allowed to change to green .
Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Purvis on his comprehensive report .
The Commission supports the basic thrust of the report .
That is also the basis for creating employment in Europe .
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on this successful attempt .
The policy paper and action plan will be the Commission 's response to Parliament 's wish for an initiative .
I expect the European Council will take a very strong position on this issue .
We need to hold discussions with a wide range of people : scientists , experts and citizens .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
I propose that the sitting be suspended until the votes are taken .
( The sitting was suspended at 11.40 a.m. and resumed at noon )
It was the answer to Question No 91 from Mrs García-Orcoyen about the national water plan .
Mrs Dührkop Dührkop , I shall do whatever needs to be done .
I listened to your point of order because it gave Members the time to arrive in Parliament .
I think it is absolutely scandalous that this should happen again .
I agree with you wholeheartedly , Mr Barón Crespo .
This is utterly unacceptable and I shall , of course , let you know the results of the enquiry .
We cannot enter into a debate , Mr Galeote Quecedo .
These , Mr Barón Crespo , are the rules of democracy .
Now I know who was responsible for the leaks .
Mr Galeote has just told us .
Very well , Mrs Kauppi , thank you for making this clear .
We shall look into this .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )

I consider that this situation is unacceptable and that measures should be adopted to ensure that this cannot happen .
I understand what you are saying Mr Miranda .
Obviously it is totally unacceptable that these people should be in the building .
If they are here , I shall do what is necessary to ensure that they leave .
Absolutely , Mr Seguro , we must definitely look into this .
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Kauppi Report ( A5-0071 / 2001 )
Inglewood Report ( A5-0072 / 2001 )
Why do they have to pay tax ? '
Stockholm European Council
The European Council is changing its presidency but liberalism is still in control .
The Swedish programme talks enthusiastically about competitiveness , competition and free trade .
Nor does this document make any secret of its desire to ' create a business-friendly climate ' .
This Summit is incredibly important to our citizens and we have to set out what Stockholm means for them .
First and foremost , jobs is our top priority .
Situation at the border between FRY / Kosovo and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
That is missing from our resolution .
That is why I wanted to vote against our resolution .
It is the responsibility of these peoples themselves to choose their own destiny in complete freedom and independence .
We have set ourselves the year 2005 as a target date for an integrated internal market in financial services .
Time is ticking by and rival markets and economies are not asleep .
von Wogau Report ( A5-0082 / 2001 )
You have hit the nail on the head ! '
Then Mr von Wogau said to me : ' Have a look at page 7 , paragraph 12 . '
I have therefore voted against the report .
That is where it leads , this alignment of socio-liberals with liberalism pure and simple .
We are voting against it .
Fava Report ( A5-0060 / 2001 )
This is not true democracy .
Therefore , the voting rules themselves must be controlled in those States .
A European stopover there would probably be instructive .
Väyrynen Report ( A5-0083 / 2001 )
They had neither freedom nor democracy , their lives consisted of work and nothing else .
However , we support increased safety for existing nuclear plant .
That is why I voted against this report .
In 1991 , to everyone ' s surprise the moment suddenly arrived .
Things have not improved since then .
I would like to discuss three aspects .
But politics is always tied up with interests .
Both sides were involved in this process and both sides gained from it .
The OSCE would be the appropriate framework for this .
Carraro Report ( A5-0063 / 2001 )
When you surf , you go into the sea , where there are always pirates .
It is also important that the Board of Directors of ICANN should be geographically representative .
This means that the budgetary and financing system of this organisation must be based on criteria of clarity .
It is only in these conditions that the viability of ICANN can be guaranteed .
Martinez-Martinez Report ( A5-0057 / 2001 )
Purvis Report ( A5-0080 / 2001 )
The questions of labelling , traceability and liability are of crucial importance for farmers .
Farmers cannot assume any civil liability for any harm caused by genetically modified products .
There must be clear rules about this .
The principle of case-by-case assessment must apply for agriculture .
An objective and comprehensive examination must weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of introducing genetically modified plants .
Madam President , I voted for the report on biotechnology .
The Pensioners ' Party and the pensioners expect a great deal from biotechnology .
They know that research is being carried out on extending the life span of human beings .
This is why the Movement for France delegation has not voted .
It calls upon researchers to participate in setting up private businesses .
It wants more mobility between universities and the private sector .
It welcomes the progress achieved in the financial markets and is in favour of stock options .
The resolution tabled by the Committee on Industry leads the way in favour of GMO production .
It claims that there is no objective scientific opinion on which to base their non-authorisation .
However , they cannot prove that there are no major drawbacks attached .
The truth will only emerge in the long term , perhaps in 30 or 50 years ' time .
In the meantime , patience and research are called for .
It is precisely that kind of patience that is lacking in Mr Purvis ' s proposal .
His aim is to give scope for rapid commercial use wherever possible .
I reject the Purvis report even more emphatically than I previously did the Bowe report .
I must vote against the Purvis report on a number of points .
BST is not allowed in any other country apart from the US .
How will we be able to pursue organic food production in crops such as wheat and the cereals ?
Organic producers assure me that they refute this statement .
I therefore reject this report .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.06 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
Access to medicaments for AIDS patients in the third world
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution :
We must press for these life-saving drugs to be made available as cheaply as possible .
For Europe , this means supporting the transfer of technology and local production capacity .
Otherwise there is a real risk of incorrect or inadequate treatment .
Only these factors will guarantee long-term development .
This resolution refers to a greatly impoverished Africa .
This applies to India in particular .
I think it is irresponsible for the pharmaceutical industry to block this legislation .
During this period , 400 000 South Africans have contracted AIDS .
Is that the humanitarianism and solidarity which inspires our resolutions ?
Ninety-five per cent of those infected with HIV live in developing countries .
By 2010 , life expectancy in Africa will fall by 20 years .
In South Africa , half of all young people already run the risk of dying from this disease .
It is a tragedy that all these countries have to cope with .
After all , the lives of millions of people are at stake .
The price varies from NLG 30 000 to NLG 450 .
In our view a court case is not the right way of solving problems .
AIDS drugs constitute only a fraction of sales .
Mr President , combating AIDS is not just a matter of the price of the drugs .
Then you have the access to medication .
Of course price is important .
The pharmaceutical companies have brought their prices down .
We are getting too emotional about this .
Let us be sure that we have a strategy for funding the purchase .
The bad news is that we need the funding to be organised .
The fight against AIDS in Africa must therefore be given the highest priority .
For that reason I wholeheartedly support the resolution .
Medical infrastructure is required , so that drugs can be dispensed in controlled conditions .
Many more laboratories with competent staff must be set up .
In addition , simple things like refrigerators are needed .
But that is still not enough .
So a great deal of money is needed , and also a new initiative .
This concerted effort will make it possible to take decisive steps forward .
This topic will remain on our agenda for some months to come .
I look forward to broadly based cooperation in this Parliament .
As you know , treatment for malaria and tuberculosis - however problematic - exists .
It will take some time before vaccines are developed and available .
However , we are on the right track and we urgently need to make progress .
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
Nevertheless , as a funereal action and as a warning to the world , our resolution holds considerable resonance .
Certainly the suppression of women 's rights in Afghanistan continues apace .
We know that the burning of books meant much more than the burning of books .
It signified something else entirely .
I think the contrary is true .
I think there are some very specific things which can be done .
I can name three .
That is an absolute basic .
We cannot keep hiding behind alibis .
So we need to get the UNDCP with its back against the wall .
What must be done to get the Taliban to reconsider ?
In practical terms it is too late for many statues .
The protest was vociferous .
It just shows you what can happen when dogma becomes law .
It is to be welcomed that we , as the European Parliament , are responding .
The Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance fully supports this resolution .
I would like to highlight these two points in our joint resolution .
' Heritage ' is not the right word to use because of its significance .
The nature of the symbol in this case are statues which also serve as idols .
It is perhaps the inverse representation of the symbol .
In terms of both nature and symbol , women in Afghanistan are totally deprived .
Let me explain what I mean by deprivation .
Rather than describe it , I will talk about it in the appropriate terms .
Discrimination is a natural corollary of exclusion .
This is called rejection .
These are the words we must use .
Who is protecting the Taliban ?
Who is supporting them ?
Who is protecting them ?
Do I have to answer ?
Can you answer with me ?
Why did we go to fight against Saddam Hussein ?
Why have we imposed sanctions against Iraq ?
Why do we not take sanctions against Afghanistan ?
Mr President , what goes on in the minds of terrorists ?
These millennia-old treasures that are part of our common cultural heritage are irreplaceable .
It is like living in the Middle Ages .
These commandments have been misinterpreted by the mullahs , an abuse that is unpardonable .
The Taliban ' s closest ally , Pakistan , intervened without success .
Commissioner , the European Union must act here .
Mr President , I would like to explain our position on this issue by making four simple points .
My third point relates to Islam .
So , there must be no demonisation , simply the desire to take action .
We must arrange a meeting .
I also asked you about this during the previous debate in this House .
The EU Troika has also sought a meeting from Islamabad without success .
This totalled more than EUR 400 million over the past ten years .
Further support for drought and conflict affected areas is planned .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution :
Situation in Zimbabwe
Zimbabwe is not only in chaos , it is under a reign of terror .
They told me that Zimbabwe is going through hell .
Europe 's efforts at quiet diplomacy just have negative results .
Our message is clear .
I commend the resolution unamended to the House .
Mr President , two Zimbabwean politicians are listening to our debate today .
They have been tortured in the past and their colleagues have been killed .
If black people kill other black people , we avert our eyes and let them get on with it .
Why do we treat people with a different skin colour in a different way ?
We are supposed to have one standard for all .
We are supposed to be not only a global economy but a one-world family .
But is that the way we react ?
We need to do something about it .
Mr President , I share the view of Mrs Maes .
I shall continue in French in order to show that indeed we must have a common stance .
What is clear is that Zimbabwe is in chaos .
Human rights there are being trampled underfoot .
Do we now need to erect a cordon sanitaire , which effectively means there will be no dialogue ?
This is an important element .
But I would also like to hear the Commission and the Council speak the same clear language .
Please do not let us wait for everything to fall apart down there .
It started with a visit from a young Zimbabwean with our local asylum seekers ' organisation .
We do not know to what , but we can suspect .
I believe our resolution is clear and I hope it gets the support it deserves .
Children abducted by one of their parents
And that is another reason for making sure that this Charter is included in our Treaty .
I am convinced that this House has the political will to carry this through .
These are facts that are , unfortunately , increasingly common and which constitute a violation of the international treaties .
I can foresee two large obstacles which will stand in the way of finding solutions .
This is therefore something we need to work on .
This is the primary aim of this resolution .
It is not a one-way process .
This is unacceptable .
This is totally unacceptable .
Many countries are undergoing major conflicts and it is crucial that people ' s rights are always safeguarded .
The fact that , on our initiative , Parliament is discussing this issue is therefore to be warmly welcomed .
We know that the current situation in Cabinda is extremely harsh for the Cabindese .
I shall not do this !
They share responsibility for the situation that has arisen and we will be watching events closely .
The adoption of a constructive position by the Angolan Government would obviously be welcomed by the international community .
This is a unique opportunity to release these people in full view of the international community .
We call once again for this to be done .
We are acting on principle here and in order to achieve a result .
Situation in Kalimantan
The riots in Kalimantan are no exception .
In addition , local disputes regarding natural resources are increasingly fierce .
Military intervention is not the answer .
Mr President , the violence in Indonesia is unremitting .
It is a huge problem , which is threatening to get the better of the Indonesian government .
Indonesia is massive in geography and population .
It is the world 's largest Muslim country .
It is a mega-player in its region and has enormous potential .
Were it to disintegrate , the implications for its neighbours would be catastrophic .
I was there two weeks ago .
It is a young democracy emerging from the oppressive years of Suharto .
Sadly the end of dictatorship so often opens the box and releases these ills .
The situation in parts of Kalimantan is intolerable and I back this motion totally .
Situation in Turkmenistan
The legislative elections in Turkmenistan have not even been recognised by the OSCE .
If you do start to think about it , then you make a mistake .
Quite the reverse , in fact !
Turkmenbashi ' s megalomania and mismanagement have instilled a general climate of fear in the country .
Whoever dares to speak up is immediately imprisoned for years .
In the Netherlands , the Protestant churches held a prayer day yesterday .
Mr President , I shall start with Zimbabwe .
Sanctions are not considered appropriate at this stage .
It neglects the plight of many very poor black people in Zimbabwe .
The Commission hopes that a solution can be rapidly found to allow them to regain their freedom .
The Indonesian leadership currently faces some extremely difficult policy choices .
They must establish temporary shelter for the refugees in Kalimantan .
The Commission is closely following the situation and would stand ready to assist if the situation justified it .
The Commission has expressed concerns about the human rights situation in Turkmenistan .
The Commission fully supports Parliament 's resolutions .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Uncontrolled trade in light weapons
A certain degree of conscience , however , now seems to be dawning upon us .
Nowadays , however , the weapons that take most lives are light weapons .
There are estimated to be five hundred thousand million light weapons on this planet .
I know they have your backing and I will support them at the appropriate time .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this plenary week is the week of conflict prevention .
This conference must be the first step towards stopping arms exports .
But there will have to be a permanent commission to check that it is enforced .
In order to do this we propose various points in the resolution .
Taking into account the time that I have , I am only going to explain three .
Secondly , an international agreement on the trade and transport of arms that is binding for all countries .
Of course , without these arms , those conflicts would not happen .
The UN Conference is therefore more overdue than premature .
I am of the opinion that the European Union must take the lead in New York .
This code has proved its usefulness but is deficient in two important areas .
First of all , it is not legally binding .
Europe must press for an international agreement which is binding .
Secondly , no provisions have been made for monitoring the end users of exported weapons .
The distribution of light weapons is , in fact , not only a problem in the Third World .
In Europe and North-America too , the possession of weapons is on the increase .
Half of all American families possess a firearm .
A number of projects emanating from the joint action are currently under way or under consideration .
The financial execution of these projects is carried out by the European Commission .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on nine motions for resolutions on disasters :
Floods in Mozambique
The country is facing a very worrying situation .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is enough to give you nightmares .
Europe should lead the way in this respect .
That country should not have to repay its debts .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we seem to have been here before .
Our intention must be to show solidarity and we must demonstrate our commitment to helping effectively .
Humanitarian disaster in Mongolia
All this has led to the death of millions of head of livestock .
So far , it has only allocated a small amount of this aid .
Mongolia needs USD eight million .
Today , the remote descendants of these feared hordes are condemned to abject poverty .
I hope that this debate will break through the indifference of the international community .
In mid-January , I , together with Mr Maat , received the Prime Minister of Mongolia .
We were taken with the openness and determination he displayed in approaching our Parliament .
I will be much obliged to you .
Mr President , Mongolia is developing into the democratic pearl of Central Asia .
One hundred thousand families and twelve million cattle are on the brink of starvation .
The European Union thus owes Mongolia something .
The Commission 's assessment confirms the need for new humanitarian aid intervention in Mozambique .
Initial funding to the tune of EUR 2 million is currently being prepared .
The evolution of the situation is being closely monitored .
The Commission 's role can then be complementary after the initial phase .
The neighbouring countries of Malawi , Zambia and Zimbabwe are also affected by the abnormally heavy rainfall .
EUR 63.5 million has been committed , of which EUR 23 million has actually been disbursed .
I now give the floor to Mr Maat .
The Commissioner has not commented on this at all .
I notice the Commissioner would like to briefly go into this point .
Mr President , I am not in a hurry at all .
I am here the whole evening .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
( The sitting was suspended until 5.30 p.m. )
Assistants ' statute
I call on the author of this question , Mr Rocard , to introduce the subject .
That has , in fact , been the strange situation up to the present time .
Now the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs wants to make its contribution to the quest for innovative solutions .
I welcome this decision .
There are , however , other problems that have not been resolved .
This solution appears both realistic and reasonable .
This year we are being presented with amendments to the text .
This realistic solution is also reasonable .
The Council wanted the European Parliament to reform its relations with its assistants in the name of transparency .
This first step was achieved thanks to the decision to which I have referred .
It does not wish to tackle tax issues .
Recourse to Regulation No 1408 / 71 does not make this necessary .
The Council does not want to give assistants the status of officials .
The European Parliament has already embarked on internal work to set the ball rolling .
The way forward depends on the normal legislative process .
That is the thinking behind our question to the Commission .
Within what timeframe , Commissioner , will this crucial text be proposed ?
The best solution would be before the start of the Belgian Presidency , since our assistants work in Belgium .
It is a pressing matter , Commissioner , and it also affects the ethics and image of our Parliament .
The Commission attaches a great deal of importance to the matter of assistants to Members of the European Parliament .
I happened to be the Commissioner responsible at the time .
As you know , however , this proposal was not accepted by the Council .
A similar option is already available to auxiliary staff of the institutions .
That means that this issue can be decided during the Belgian Presidency .
I think that should really always be settled at the start of the period .
But I would like to sound a warning against excessive bureaucracy and inflexibility .
There are rumoured to be plans for all assistants to be subject to Belgian law .
Strasbourg is the seat of Parliament .
There is therefore no point in making assistants who work here , for example , subject to Belgian law .
I think that today , however , we should be clear about what our objectives are .
These demands are now no longer written in this way in the agenda .
Commissioner , our assistants expect the Commission to take the initiative .
Thank you . We look forward to them .
We thank you above all on behalf of all the assistants who work in this House .
We may therefore find ourselves disagreeing with these suggestions in various respects .
First , it must be simple .
It must be simple both in terms of clarity and in terms of its administration .
Second , it must provide the legal certainty .
This means that it must be comprehensive in its coverage of the employment relationship .
This need not mean rigidity and uniformity .
Third , it must be transparent .
I hope that we move down it as rapidly as we can .
You have given us some good news .
The pace is to be speeded up .
We can all rejoice at that .
What is the current state of play ?
The Council asked us to abandon the route towards turning our assistants into officials .
We complied .
We withdrew this document , which had caused the Council so many problems , from the negotiating table .
The Council asked Parliament to get rid of any reference to taxation .
So , here we are .
We have taken the steps we were asked to take .
Parliament has done its bit . It is now up to the other institutions to do theirs .
What can be done ?
Give us a legal basis .
All the political groups are united in asking you to take this decisive step .
Give us this legal basis and we will do the rest .
We need you to take this decisive step .
Our fellow Members have said so .
Legality , simplicity , transparency and a high level of social protection are called for .
Mr President , Commissioner , I fully agree with what Mr Onesta has just said .
For too long now our parliamentary assistants have worked without being protected by a statute .
I welcome this .
The EDD Group is lending its unqualified support to the assistants ' legitimate wishes .
I would like to make one final remark in this connection .
The Council should perhaps reconsider precisely what now constitute unjustified discrepancies .
Indeed , we must repudiate discrimination at all times .
I would , however , like to concur with Mr Posselt who has warned against too much red tape .
It is already very complex and time-consuming to act in the correct manner .
In any event , I suspect that we are a long way from that point .
Later , if the Belgian Presidency is successful , we will have to conclude the work .
That , however , Mr President , is simply a matter of tidying up loose ends .
Mr President , Commissioner , everything has been said .
We have done that .
You have pledged to do this .
You have just given that assurance , for which I thank you .
Thank you for pledging to help us get through it .
I thank Parliament for this very clear message .
Mr Posselt on the rules of procedure .
It was uncommonly difficult to accommodate everyone .
We had to disappoint a large number of colleagues .
The present method of calculation is clearly not altogether realistic .
Ladies and gentlemen , please take the rules of procedure seriously .
Mr President , I should just like to point out that some of us are very environmentally friendly .
We actually walk in .
That is even healthier !
Before the vote on Kalimantan :
I shall be writing to the President of this Parliament to express my concern at this action .
Before the vote on light weapons :
( Parliament had no objections to the oral amendments )
That concludes our agenda for this week .
I wish you all a safe journey home .
The France ' s borders are closed !
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
( The sitting closed at 6.45 p.m. )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 15 March .
Statement by the President
I have also sent a message of our support to the Spanish authorities .
I would ask you to observe a minute ' s silence .
( The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence )
Relating to Thursday :
Madam President , I should briefly like to explain our request .
Does any Member wish to speak in favour of keeping this item ?
There being no speaker , I shall put the request to the vote .
( Parliament gave its assent )
Madam President , this is a serious problem , yet limited in terms of scope .
However , we should not generalise .
This was not the Holy See ' s policy .
Now the Vatican too has taken measures and launched its own inquiry .
Accordingly , my group proposes not to include this topic in the urgent and topical debate .
Does any Member wish to speak in favour of keeping this item ?
In this light , we cannot just dismiss this subject as marginal .
For years , the existence of a problem was simply denied .
I believe Parliament should make a statement on this .
I hope that I will be able to count on your support .
( Parliament rejected the request )
This also applies to the Council .
Madam President , there is another serious matter which surfaced very briefly .
Thank you , Mr van Velzen .
I shall check this with Mr Imbeni .
However , it was difficult to begin a debate since Mr Imbeni was not here .
Having said that , I shall do my best to resolve the issue .
The order of business is thus adopted .
Speeches on procedure
I take this opportunity to enthusiastically greet all the Members of this Parliament .
I do not believe that it is worth wasting much time replying to criminal asses .
Thank you very much .
Thank you , Mr Krivine .
Only nations have the right to judge their leaders , no one else .
Is this the punishment for resistance ?
I think that you must be aware of what you want .
( Loud applause )
Madam President , you will shortly be paying an official visit to the Netherlands .
I am very much looking forward to that .
Why do you only talk to government officials ?
They are the people with whom I am in closest contact .
The next item is the joint discussion on the following reports :
Unifying these markets will help to complete the single market .
The Commission communication is not a legislative text .
In Europe we have many more than one .
The regulations need to be adjusted accordingly .
There was not a single amendment made to my report , which I am very happy about .
This is very much under way in FESCO .
Just to have a good and relevant directive will not be enough .
Madam President , I welcome and support both the reports we are discussing today .
They are excellent and I congratulate both the rapporteurs on the hard work that they have done on them .
We should have a country-of-origin approach underlying this directive .
The Commission has been far too tentative in enforcement .
This system and this concern also appear in Mr Katiforis ' s report .
I congratulate both of them on their work and I repeat that we support them .
In this way , financial stability will be safeguarded in the future .
Two further points , which have also already been mentioned , are of concern to me here .
My second concern is that there should be genuine competition between stock exchanges and trading platforms .
To make fair competition possible an appropriate and efficient system of supervision needs to be set up .
I thank both Mr Katiforis and Mrs Kauppi for the reports which they have produced .
They reflect a very large measure of agreement .
It is good to hear that speakers have supported these two reports .
The Commission has also taken cognisance of these two reports with great pleasure .
That directive defines common regulatory parameters for investor protection and orderly markets .
The Commission believes that the judgment must be mitigated .
I will now mention a few specific points which are contained in the report prepared by Mrs Kauppi .
The challenge is to reach this goal in a manner which offers sufficient safeguards to the retail investor .
The Commission is hopeful that such convergence can be achieved within a relatively short time-frame .
I now come to a few points which are specific to the report prepared by Mr Katiforis .
These are not adequately addressed by the current ISD .
The Katiforis report cautions against sweeping changes at this time .
That will hopefully be made known in a few weeks time .
The Commission will study these proposals carefully when preparing the revision of the ISD .
The Commission agrees with that view .
The Commission would like to assure Parliament that it will act accordingly .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
And is it ? This is what I am asking myself and also all of you .
Now , however , the question is : what happens with new ingredients ?
Is this true ?
No , it is not .
What does ' a marketing ban some time in the future ' mean ?
Of course , I am also starting from the assumption that the products are safe .
I would never want this .
Yes , there should be a test ban .
The seventh amendment should , of course , bring even more improvements .
This is unacceptable .
So they have to be labelled .
What I am proposing is nothing more and nothing less .
Once they have been opened , how long can they be kept ?
After all , we also need to go into the second reading with something to play for .
I invite them to do so here and now .
That is not entirely certain , however , as no precedents have been set .
This should serve as something of a warning to Parliament .
It appears that there has been an error in the translations .
I completely agree with the rapporteur on the need to put an end to experiments on animals .
We have given in too easily to pressure from the WTO .
Do we need products that are only distinguishable from each other through advertising ?
Naturally we need to ensure that products are free of risk to the consumer .
I agree entirely with the rapporteur .
At the heart of this debate lies the problem of the World Trade Organisation .
The truth is we do not know whether possible objections can be sustained .
If they can , then change is needed .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work and the work of the Committee .
It is a major improvement on what the Commission has actually proposed .
The proposal from the Commission is not only fundamentally flawed but it is also extremely disappointing .
This will actually encourage more animal testing .
In the name of international trade , tens of thousands of healthy animals are being slaughtered .
In this light , the testing of cosmetics on animals pales into insignificance .
Nevertheless , this subject is not unimportant .
I believe that all these animals are creatures of God and deserve to be protected for that reason .
In addition , we have been given animals to use for our daily nutritional needs .
Animal experimentation is an entirely different matter .
We can accept experiments on animals for the development and testing of essential medicines .
There are , however , less essential purposes for which animal tests are used .
In my opinion , these also cover cosmetics .
I therefore back Mrs Roth-Behrendt ' s report .
A warning on the label that these could cause an allergic reaction should , in my opinion , suffice .
This should , however , not stop us from forging ahead .
If this leads to a more limited choice of products , so be it .
Of course , no one is in favour of animal testing .
Nevertheless , in this case , we must be seen to act in a realistic and consistent manner .
In the current situation , however , there is a lack of sufficiently reliable alternative methods .
To put it mildly , does that not amount to an unfortunate clash in our agenda ?
As usual , it is the poorest people who will suffer from our legislative whims .
Will thousands of workers ' jobs be put at risk ?
Of course they will , and once again , it is the least well-off who will foot the bill .
Ladies and gentlemen , does this sound like the social Europe that you have been hoping and praying for ?
And who would be responsible then , my dear Commissioner ?
It is not even the status quo .
It is not .
Those who deferred our hopes should listen now .
I have certainly benefited from discussions with them .
The development of these over the last few years has been a major step forward .
That is not the case at all .
It is a necessary precaution which should not threaten a single valid product .
We have done it elsewhere , at great gain to human health .
That is why a marketing ban is also needed .
Instead , competition would mean that other methods would have to be developed .
As a liberal , I care a great deal about the rights of individuals .
I also care a great deal about free , informed choice on the part of consumers .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very good report .
There was also a very good debate in committee .
We have to set a date and keep to it .
It is rather embarrassing .
What on earth will we do then ?
We will be even more scared .
Any scientist will admit that this is true .
We cannot know about the WTO .
It is right that we hold the line .
This report is well worked out in its detail .
If we listen to those arguments , we would do almost nothing in this Parliament .
I commend the Roth-Behrendt report to you .
To achieve an alternative takes up to ten years .
I fear the answer to both questions is no .
We have to keep the pressure on .
We must require alternatives to be used as soon as they are validated .
We must distinguish between makeup and cosmetics that have a medicinal purpose .
Let me do so .
We have already discussed this in committee .
If this is not possible then they will just have to take those which are already available .
In the Committee Mr Davies ' produced ' the philosophers ' stone .
He refuted a deadly argument .
Then , some people have said , but there are already tests .
Optimal care must be combined with a maximum degree of consumer protection .
We can only guarantee this optimal safety by having numerous scientific tests .
It is our declared objective to bring to an end the era of animal testing .
We need to support all scientific moves towards achieving this .
Nevertheless , consumer protection and product safety are our prime concern .
It is also important for consumers to know which products can cause allergies .
You are right !
How horrible ! ' and continued to apply cream to her face .
However , she was wearing night cream which smelt horrible .
I said to her : ' But do you know that these creams are tested on animals ? '
However , later on , while I was asleep , I dreamt of Mrs Roth-Behrendt .
There were mushrooms for dinner , and so I asked her whether she was sure they were not poisonous .
' No ! ' she shrieked , ' not on my pussy cat , not on animals ! '
Mr President , our group thinks that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has done a very good job .
We support all the important parts of the report .
Nor is there any doubt about public opinion on this issue .
We therefore support a comprehensive ban on these tests .
If such a ban is to be effective , it nonetheless needs to be combined with a marketing ban .
As a counter-argument , we are told that the WTO might object to a ban .
We also support the other parts of the report .
We believe that more account must be taken of people with allergies .
That is why we are in favour of tightening up on the use of allergy-causing substances .
The Commission is well aware that the debate on animal testing is a very difficult and sensitive one .
This cannot be done by one part of industry alone .
Let me recall the reasons behind the Commission 's proposal .
The Community is bound to ensure compliance with its international obligations .
Only a coordinated approach at international level can improve animal welfare on a wider scale .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Environmental issues of PVC
I would like to make this quite clear .
It neither sees nor admits to there being much of a problem at all .
In that respect their views are in conflict with the spirit of the Commission ' s Green Paper .
The PVC industry does not want additional studies conducted by outsiders to support their views .
As draftsman of the opinion , I would like to say that I supported the minority opinion .
Mr President , allow me to start by thanking Mr Sacconi .
He has certainly made every effort to see whether a compromise could be struck .
I would in any event like to thank him for the consultations on this matter .
The opinions on PVC and its effects on health and the environment are very diverse .
Those measures are not the same across the board and can thus have implications for the internal market too .
We are thus fortunate , especially in the medical sphere , to have PVC .
Allow me to list a few of these additives .
There are the plasticisers to start with .
There is an ongoing debate whether or not phthalates have an impact on living organisms .
The second additive is cadmium .
I believe that industry has already entered into a large number of effective commitments voluntarily .
Cadmium is being phased out . In this respect , the Green Paper is in fact outdated .
The case of lead is quite different .
This brings me to production and incineration in general .
Furthermore , research has shown that these self-imposed emission values have been achieved comfortably .
Insofar as PVC is not reused , it is generally incinerated in a waste incineration plant .
An important aspect in this connection is the high chlorine content .
The elimination of PVC from waste plants is thus important .
This should therefore be closely monitored .
The volume of PVC waste continues to grow , however .
The problems that exist with disposal have been mentioned here .
We therefore need a proper investigation into the matter .
I do not think we can simply put our trust in industry ' s own voluntary agreements .
For this we shall need legislation at European level .
Mr President , what are we to do with PVC ?
Some people are trying to make out that this material is public enemy number one .
We find this hard to grasp .
This might well be the case .
Politicians need not judge these benefits .
What measures will we be taking ?
The precautionary principle requires us to do this .
We believe that similar action should be taken with regard to lead and organotin .
In this respect , industry could indeed make an extra effort .
In this connection , the Green Paper gives in actual fact insufficient cause for this .
There is a lot of explaining to be done before that happens .
Mr President , PVC is the second most commonly used plastic .
It poses significant environment and health problems over its entire life cycle .
This call did not just come from environmentalists .
There was very clear and strong support for the substitution of PVC .
Whose interests come first ?
It has to be the interests of all those people that attended the Commission hearing .
Mr President , PVC has unique qualities as a plastic , of course .
It is strong and hard-wearing , which makes it suitable for use in a number of areas .
However , PVC also has other qualities , being the source of unusually hazardous waste .
This creates very major environmental problems when it comes to disposing of it .
We are convinced that voluntary agreements are not enough and that genuine legislation is required instead .
What ought to be done , then ?
That is the only way of reducing the quantity of waste .
The issue of voluntary agreements arises in this connection .
A voluntary agreement cannot , of course , involve a ban on imports .
Legislation would be more effective and more environmentally friendly than a voluntary agreement .
We also want to see more done to promote recycling .
Overall , we are very satisfied with Mr Sacconi ' s report .
We have therefore tabled only a few amendments .
That is why it is appropriate to mention the substitution principle in this context too .
Specific preventive and protective measures must therefore be taken so as to reduce workers ' exposure to PVC .
No data are available on the state of landfill waste containing large amounts of PVC .
Finally , it is important to support the use of alternatives to PVC products .
This is an early indicator of how difficult and confusing the entire discussion surrounding PVC is .
PVC is a very important material in our society .
The production of PVC is justified if strict emission requirements are met .
The resolution hits the nail on the head by calling for reinforcement of European waste strategy .
Unfortunately , since the recycling of PVC has been very slow to take off , incentives are needed .
In my opinion , the phasing out of organotin compounds is too premature at this stage .
The same applies to phthalates in my view .
It is certainly wrong to confine ourselves solely to the problems of disposing of PVC .
The use of lead is also becoming less common .
Against this background it would be irresponsible to call for a moratorium on PVC .
Compulsory marking of PVC products would also lead to considerable distortions of competition .
In the European Union alone , 21,000 small and medium-sized companies are affected .
PVC as a material needs to undergo a thorough assessment of its entire life-cycle .
It is certainly possible to find a sensible recycling solution .
That is why we need differentiated collection and distinctive labelling of PVC .
There are certainly alternatives .
What I find completely irresponsible is the panic-mongering about jobs .
This means that these manufacturers could just as easily use other materials .
After all , we know that the leading PVC manufacturers are just as capable of producing the alternatives .
We need to remind ourselves of the risks .
Allow me also to comment on the argument that industry should have a system of self-regulation .
Surely this shows that this is complete rubbish , a smokescreen .
We should not be taken in by this .
Mr President , we are surrounded by chemicals in our everyday lives .
The problem we faced there was determining how much of the chemical gets into people 's bodies .
No migration testing is available to test how much of these chemicals enters people 's bodies .
Of course that will also be relevant in the application of PVC to medical goods .
Other PVCs are treated with stabilisers to prevent them being broken down by heat and light .
In particular , window frames have been mentioned .
We must certainly try to recycle more PVC .
We are looking at a 60-year life cycle .
Before we ban something we should look at the whole picture .
We all know that there is widespread concern about PVC within our society .
Much of the Sacconi report I entirely endorse .
I support the phase out of dangerous and unnecessary additives .
I believe the voluntary recycling commitments must be reinforced and turned into legally binding agreements .
This is the beginning of a very long debate before we reach the stage of legislation .
It must be a wide-ranging and broad-based debate .
I welcome Mr Sacconi 's report as the first step in the right direction .
This has been quite perceptible here today .
I think that we have a great deal more to do here .
In my opinion this is also how it will stay in the near future .
I , myself , am no friend of self-regulation ; I have always campaigned hard against it .
After all , we need laws to achieve something .
Urgent efforts should therefore be made to find substitutes for these two toxic substances .
In addition the percentage of material recycled must be increased .
The Green Paper had also asked for written opinions on the questions put forward .
There was a huge number of responses .
We received more than 30 000 e-mails , faxes and letters .
In addition , the Commission received official opinions from the majority of Member States .
This strategy will serve as a framework for future initiatives on PVC .
Pension schemes and funds
At the moment , we have on the table the Commission proposal on supplementary occupational retirement provision .
The European Commission 's proposal for a directive contains no reference to tax arrangements .
Commissioner , you have announced that a communication will soon be published .
I agree with Mrs Randzio-Plath on her first question .
It must be supplemented by further initiatives .
This aspect will be the subject of a separate initiative by the Commission .
The adoption of the communication is now scheduled for two weeks ' time .
It effectively closes off the pension markets of many Member States .
As I said , the Commission is in the process of adopting a communication .
This objective is to use pension funds to strengthen Europe 's financial markets .
I now turn to the issue of taxation .
So when is it going to arrive ?
You are therefore required to table something .
For once the Commission also needs to start to show courage , courage against the Council of Ministers .
We should also be dealing with the tax problems , as I said just now .
The pension communication has not yet been adopted by the Commission .
Mr Kuckelkorn criticised the Commission for being so tardy ; he mentioned the delays .
May I say that the Commission is running into important manpower problems .
The financial services action plan is a considerable task consisting of 42 measures .
Tonight is perhaps too early for a detailed discussion of that communication .
Mr Karas said that the directive or the communication could have included more aspects .
He gave the English translation of that saying .
Mr Kuckelkorn said , " Would you please stand up to the Council of Ministers ? "
Certainly the Commission would not be hesitant in such cases .
Lastly , I have not yet addressed Mr Huhne .
May I express the gratitude of the Commission for his support .
He would have liked the Commission to be somewhat more robust .
I do not think it would be useful to reopen the discussion at this time of night .
We have already had a discussion .
This will be coming back to Parliament at a later date .
The debate is closed .
( The sitting was closed at 8.38 p.m. )
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Parliament did this for the last time on 11 March 1999 .
Mr van Velzen , I have taken note of that .
I recall that the President told you yesterday that she would attend to that .
Mr President , I regret the fact that we are discussing this matter once again .
I hope that these words of mine will be recorded in the Minutes .
( Applause from the left )
Thank you , Mr Seguro .
I do not intend to allow a debate on this subject .
If there are any other requests to speak on this , I shall not accept them .
The President made it clear yesterday what she intends to do .
So that is the end of this item .
I am afraid that I cannot do any more at this point .
( Parliament approved the Minutes )
Decision on urgent procedure
What we have here is an old demand made by Parliament finally taking effect .
That is why my committee is supporting this request for urgent procedure .
And these farms would nevertheless be given income aid through the channel of animal feed .
That will please Commissioner Schreyer .
I call on the House to vote for this request .
( Parliament approved the request for urgent procedure )
2002 budget guidelines / Financial perspective
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
Section I - European Parliament
Section II - Council
Section IV - Court of Justice
Section V - Court of Auditors
Section VI - Economic and Social Committee
Section VII - Committee of the Regions
Section VIII - Ombudsman ;
It is with this idea in mind that the following priorities have been defined :
BSE and foot-and-mouth disease have raised many issues .
At the same time , a great deal is still expected of the Veterinary Inspection Office .
We are waiting for decisions to be taken on this .
We need to quickly work out in which direction we are heading and why we are going there .
We must start discussing this issue before 15 September .
Secondly , the budget must be implemented with greater rigour , efficiency and transparency .
Central to achieving this objective is the report that the Commission will present in June .
This phenomenon calls for a multidisciplinary approach .
The e ­ learning initiative must be ambitious because it is so crucial .
Let us find the courage to fight on .
Mr President , we are at the start of the budget cycle .
We will be further detailing the 2002 budget of the other institutions very shortly .
I will ensure that future cooperation with your will be sound .
Allow me to outline the salient points of the report .
I would like to start with enlargement .
We cannot afford to sit idly until that moment arrives .
The institutions must be ready to welcome the candidate countries .
The preparatory activities generate costs , even before enlargement has actually taken place .
The financial perspective must therefore reflect these extra needs .
Another major point is efficiency .
We owe it to the tax payer to exercise strict budgetary discipline and healthy financial management .
Activity-Based Management and Activity-Based Budgeting will help us achieve this .
That is why we are asking the institutions to make their budgets more transparent .
We will be drafting proposals to that effect this coming year .
The institutions will need to display more than budgetary discipline .
They will need to play an exemplary role .
I would like to mention two areas which are important to me in that respect .
Equal treatment should be the cornerstone of our staffing policy .
In this connection , we need to consider our buildings and the materials we use .
We need to develop mobility plans .
In the final analysis , this will all need translating and then distributing in writing .
We hope to set a good example .
I will , however , say a few words on the Council ' s budget .
This budget has experienced strong growth .
That is an objectionable development .
That is why we are concerned .
Our differences so far relate to two chapters .
The other institutions do not agree .
This will not be the central issue .
And the other difference relates to the profile of this new budgeting .
Originally , the Commission was in favour of more linear budgeting .
The specific figures we have proposed are not a question of principle .
The question of principle is the profile of spending .
I am speaking also on behalf of my colleague , Mr Wijkman , who is not here .
It is quite ridiculous that this state of affairs should be allowed to continue .
Finally , a global fund for the combating of Aids needs to be considered in our budget .
Just asking the chemical companies and pharmaceutical companies to cut prices is not enough .
( Applause from the right )
With regard to the Costa Neves report , I believe that the rapporteur has set the right tone .
However , I would like to take this opportunity to make an observation with regard to the employment programmes .
I believe that this year , we should perhaps take stock and try to draw the necessary conclusions .
The Commission , and especially the Council itself tend to overlook this .
This is also evident from its absence today .
That is , in actual fact , a very important , if not entirely clear , debate .
We hope that the cooperation with the rapporteur continues at first reading .
Otherwise , I accept the guidelines and support them .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
The first point relates to the issue of statistical information , or rather the lack of it .
Statistical information is highly important for the work of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
This applies to the structural indicators , for example .
The committee is therefore calling for sufficient funding for the budget line on statistical information .
The same also applies to the Commission , of course .
We are reacting here to the Lamfalussy report .
It is better to tackle this point than to go through the legislative procedure at a snail 's pace .
Fourthly , we wish to stress the need to improve the human resources of the Commission 's Directorates-General .
( Applause )
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on establishing a clear set of priorities .
We need to recognise that this is where the future of new European jobs lies .
We also have to address the issue of the possibility of the emergence of a digital divide in Europe .
My second point relates to energy .
It is clear that we are too dependent on external resources .
What we must do is enhance Europe 's renewable energy capacity .
Therefore , we need corporate approach looking at alternative sources of energy .
We have two very modest requests of the budget which are contained within the Buitenweg report .
One is that there should be a proper database so that citizens can follow their petitions through the Internet .
That is free .
It does not cost anything .
And not every EU issue has to be specified in the budget .
It is certainly important to make these distinctions here .
That is why I would like to concentrate on a couple of key areas .
That is the be-all and end-all for our farmers .
This is an important task that we have to tackle together in the context of the 2002 budget .
This is not acceptable .
The Council really must consider if everything it is doing in this way is advisable .
That is just not on .
It does not have an impact on the budget .
Justice and home affairs policy does not have an impact on the budget .
That is simply a matter of fact .
I would , however , also like to mention the subject of administrative budgets .
I would like to ask , without making any bones about it , who the administration is there for ?
We are also discussing the financial perspective .
We are talking about the Sixth Framework Programme on Research , which we want more money for .
We are also taking about inflating administrative budgets .
The Council now wants an additional EUR 10 million .
So we are also coming under enormous pressure as regards administrative expenditure .
Mr Ferber , on moral grounds I have to reject your last proposal .
However , we have to recognise that we are , of course , dealing with taxpayers ' money .
We are dealing with tax revenue .
It is all very easy to say that with hindsight .
Consumer confidence and food quality are , of course , also acute problems .
Last year , the unemployment rate fell from 8.7 % to 8 % .
People have a right to expect us to fight hard against unemployment .
My next point is the common foreign and security policy .
That should be an important priority for us .
The 2002 budget guidelines clearly show the budgetary policy the European Parliament is to adopt .
To achieve this the intention is to move towards an activity-based budget and administrative system .
We shall return to this subject in connection with the discharge procedure for 2000 .
Parliament is also demanding that delays and arrears should be dealt with .
One particular problem is the agricultural budget .
The main question for the future will be the trend in administrative expenditure under heading 5 .
Crisis management is clearly a matter of operational expenditure .
In particular , I would like to draw your attention once again to her comments about multiannual plans .
We need long-term planning for the administration of the European Parliament .
The foot-and-mouth crisis demonstrates that there is a profound crisis in the EU 's agricultural policy .
The second priority is eastward enlargement , which presents enormous challenges for the EU .
We very much hope that the appropriations provided for 2000 will actually be implemented .
We must utilise these appropriations .
I believe that the call for the financial perspective to be adjusted is justified .
But this is not just about more money .
I believe that this is an area where we need to think more about efficiency .
There is an urgent need for reform in various external policy areas .
Mr President , I would like to start by thanking the rapporteurs for their work .
This is a considerable problem which has been around for years .
However , I do share the rapporteur ' s view that something needs to be done .
The policy adopted hitherto cannot be sold to the citizens .
But what a surprise .
I cannot quite follow this line of thought .
There is every reason to get to the bottom of this problem .
What , for example , is the reason for the payments falling behind the commitments to such an extent ?
Is this not quite simply a question of far too generous budgeting ?
We need to learn from the mistakes we made in the past , and economise as a Parliament .
The unspent appropriations should not always be transferred to the subsequent years .
We must tailor the appropriations to the Commission ' s implementation capacity .
Programmes which are not effective must be abandoned .
I would like to gain a clear picture of his plans .
I suggest including this major development in the report at this late stage .
They are responsible for their own revenue .
These are essentially national responsibilities , national budgets .
On the contrary , they seemed somewhat hostile to it .
We know that scarce resources in the budget will be with us for the foreseeable future .
We should investigate that more .
To conclude , I welcome the fact that this interinstitutional spirit is emerging .
With this type of guideline we will not go far wrong as we go through this year .
I wish to comment on several items .
First , Mr Costa Neves ' report and the Commission 's budget .
Having said that , we still await the World Bank report on the needs of Serbia .
We will see problems arising in the future with Category 5 .
These are essential .
On the Buitenweg report , can I comment on the fact that enlargement is a problem .
We need to resolve this between the three institutions .
It is something that will not go away and as each week passes it approaches quicker and quicker .
The three reports establish a number of obvious political priorities .
Some organisations are funded year after year and actually become dependent on these funds .
This is something that must be addressed .
With regard to Mrs Buitenweg ' s report , some of its provisions are unacceptable .
A final word on Mr Colom i Naval ' s report .
In previous parliamentary terms , we have supported large agricultural concerns at the expense of small farmers .
We have always argued that interinstitutional cooperation is the best way to make progress in a budgetary negotiation .
My group particularly welcomes the reference to the assistance statute and the funding for political parties .
That really is putting the cart before the horse .
Therefore , I would urge our colleagues in the PPE-DE to withdraw these amendments .
Mr President , the Community budget is the blood supply to a sustainable common agricultural policy .
It is difficult to recall a more challenging time for agriculture and the future of European farmers .
BSE and foot-and-mouth have added a new and unexpected dimension to the European agenda .
The psychological impact on farmers and rural communities is considerable .
Consumers remain confused and bewildered .
We argue about amendments that the European public will not understand .
This is extremely important .
The long-term objectives of the European Union should be served as best we can by the budget .
We are being misled at the moment on the whole question of the size of the budget .
Mr Wynn says that the Council says there is no more money : absolute rubbish !
There was a time when we had a limit of 1.1 % .
We got it - and very responsibly we did not spend it .
It is still there .
We now have a crisis in agriculture particularly and that crisis needs to be addressed .
We cannot change the rules and we cannot deny it to them .
Their own government has crucified them by refusing to allow them into the single currency .
If the Council insists there is a limit , we have to insist that it is 1.27 % .
In my view , that does not emerge clearly enough in the section relating to the Commission .
There is obviously a significant degree of uncertainty built into this .
We do not know to which countries this will apply , or how many of them there will be .
The future I am describing is just three years away from us .
In this connection , I believe there are two things which must happen with immediate effect .
Mrs Buitenweg ' s guidelines are excellent in the way they address the issue .
I assume , therefore , that it will also be vigorously pursued in the course of the year .
I would ask for solidarity for the fisheries sectors in Spain and Portugal .
Mr President , I would like to draw your attention to two areas .
Allow me to begin with the fisheries sector .
The spending of that funding , particularly in the developing countries , is not being monitored effectively .
There is hardly any room in the fisheries budget .
A key element in this connection is that food is a basic necessity of life .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , why does the Council want a competitive Europe ?
And why do we support this objective ?
That is the number one priority .
To achieve this , we therefore need access to finance , particularly for micro-companies .
I am sure that Parliament is properly under control for that period .
This morning I want to concentrate on just one issue : structural funding .
Why it has not yet been fully used and what should its future be ?
I want to be both controversial and constructive .
We should be looking ahead .
In other words , the new countries will expect and should obtain funding for their requirements .
As we have heard , this is the intention .
But why not take advantage of that straight away ?
Why not send back the funding that has not been used to the countries who pay the contributions ?
They are mainly the ones hit by foot-and-mouth .
They need to use that money to compensate for the crisis in rural areas .
First , we have long called upon the Commission to do more with regard to greening the budget .
We would look for a fresh initiative from the Commission on this .
Make sure the money is properly spent in a sustainable way .
We cannot compromise on environmental standards in those areas .
I hope that monies will be directed towards ensuring that .
There are two other important issues which I want to bring to the attention of the Commission .
Please get this sorted out .
We need a new initiative from the Commission on this .
It is time to break the deadlock .
The continued spending of money in that way is unacceptable .
I hope the Commission has heard what we say .
These questions demonstrate that the EU 's budget planning must be flexible enough to cope with unforeseen expenditure .
The financial perspective allows the highest rate of increase in agricultural expenditure .
That is certainly not chicken feed .
These are still on the Council 's table .
Estimated expenditure passed the EUR 100 million mark a week ago .
The subject of an interim review of agricultural policy has also been raised .
This is a process that will now be starting in order to examine our agricultural policy .
We are currently examining whether or not this will be necessary .
I think that is good news for all consumers .
Of course , full provision is made for important structural support programmes in the budget planning process .
EUR 6.15 billion are involved here .
Mr Colom i Naval made some observations about this .
Firstly , the problem of illegal immigration .
Many people are brought here by gangs of traffickers .
Secondly , there is the area of e-learning .
We should not forget that .
As Mr Wynn remarked , this still has to be confirmed by the World Bank report .
That is why we are once again requesting the budgetary authority for these posts .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The joint debate is closed .
Determination of Member States ' payments to the VAT-based own resource
Mrs Haug has the floor .
We now know that in fact that did not happen until September 2000 .
So that is the legal position .
So far , so good .
That is why we are now trying to take a tiny step towards that goal .
The Commission is willing to actively support us in this task .
I really wish to specifically thank the Commissioner very sincerely for that .
We are having to fight as regards the directive on the European Company statute .
We are having to fight over human resources for the common foreign and security policy .
We therefore also fully recommend the second amendment .
The result will possibly be the same as always : they will ignore us .
These amendments increase the possibility of such a dialogue and must therefore be accepted .
I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work .
In Berlin there was a lengthy dispute regarding contributions .
The resulting gap in the EU budget is to be bridged by increasing the GNP share .
Only the question of the reduction in contributions made by the United Kingdom will remain open in the future .
In the future enlargement will wreak havoc on the EU budget .
This will mean a delay in the whole decision-making process .
The situation will have been sorted out by 2002 with the ratification of the own resources decision .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
Can you give me a name ?
Mrs Theato , as always , you are very well informed .
And as you are well informed , you will see that the Council is clearly absent .
I am not going to criticise the Council .
It will explain its reasons at the appropriate moment .
We take good note of its absence .
Mrs Theato has the floor once again for another point of order .
I trust that it is the last one , Mrs Theato .
Your words will appear in the Minutes .
Mrs Stauner has the floor .
I would like to address just three particular matters of concern .
We judge the Commission not by its words , but by its deeds .
At the beginning of its period of office , the Commission espoused the cause of transparency and openness .
Nor was there any substantial improvement for the 1999 discharge procedure .
I think these figures speak for themselves .
This framework agreement is driving a wedge between Members and is creating a two-tier Parliament .
It is encouraging a policy of divide et impera - divide and rule .
We can no more tolerate this than we can tolerate a lack of access to general documents .
Please take that opportunity here today .
Has the Commission lived up to expectations , then ?
The Commission is now aware that the threat is real .
This year , there are certain MEPs who will refuse to grant discharge .
I believe that would be a very big mistake .
This is something we must only do in special circumstances when we have really good arguments for doing so .
If we do it every year , the threat , of course , loses its value .
We must cooperate with all those forces that wish to make European cooperation more efficient and open .
I think that this is what most MEPs want .
I have therefore collaborated with all the political groups represented in the Committee .
The new Commission has initiated large-scale reform .
Mr Kinnock has promised us the best administration in the world .
We shall now see whether the fine words can be put into practice .
I have prepared a very critical , yet constructive report .
In 1999 , things were simply a mess .
We must hope that the reforms will remedy this .
I look forward to hearing the Commission ' s response to my proposals .
We have received a lot of information this year .
In my experience , this is a poor framework agreement .
In my opinion , we should work towards a re-negotiation of the framework agreement .
However , Parliament should certainly also ' look nearer home ' .
We must therefore ensure that the Commission can trust us .
I am delighted that the Commission has put its trust in me as rapporteur .
This indicates that the new Commission is interested in , and respects , the discharge procedure .
That is something I do not agree with . Parliament should not be a detective agency .
I therefore made a great effort to incorporate all the institutions in my report .
Both the Council and Parliament set limits upon the Commission ' s work .
Agricultural policy is a good example .
The Commission has fought hard to reform agricultural policy .
Unfortunately , there are many such examples , for example in the flax , milk and butter sectors .
What do they really discuss behind the closed doors of the Council ?
They rejected my request .
I have other things to say , but I shall return to these at the end of the debate .
I hope that this will be the procedure from now on .
On the qualitative side , we found that the European Parliament administers a huge budget .
Nothing could be further from the truth , as is once again borne out in the annual discharge debate .
In this respect , assistance from the European Court of Auditors is at hand .
However , the Committee on Budgetary Control believes that the monitoring procedure could be far more effective still .
Needless to say , this hardly contributes to restoring public confidence .
However , we now see that the Council is assuming further operational responsibilities .
I can be brief about the committees and agencies .
All European institutions must continue to demonstrate their added value .
They must ensure that the money of the European taxpayer is spent wisely .
How do they impact on legislation ?
Do they operate efficiently ?
We should really close this chapter once and for all .
We are stepping up the pressure to bring about reforms within this Parliament too .
In accordance with decisions taken earlier , it will cease in July 2002 .
Over the last decade , the way the ECSC has acted is reminiscent of banking .
The Commission has been responsible for the ECSC .
In recent years preparations have been under way to wind it down in July 2002 .
The fund will provide support for activities related to the main ECSC areas of industry .
There is probably no lack of subjects for research .
The information is not now available .
After that EU staff will be in debt to the EU .
It is not appropriate that the EU should act as a mortgage bank for its staff .
The committee believes these loans should be transferred to banks .
The committee offers this for the Commission to consider in connection with the granting of discharge .
The EU cannot be a mortgage lender for its personnel .
Mr President , I would particularly like to support what Mrs Theato said in her speech .
I too regard it as an enormous problem that the Council is not present for this debate .
There are still unresolved conflicts of responsibility between the Member States and the Commission here .
But this is a clear decision , and I have the full support of the Committee on Budgetary Control .
The Commissioner has some difficult tasks before him .
There is a backlog of commitments that he has inherited from the old Commission .
The administrative structures are inappropriate and understaffed .
And it has to be said that the backlog of payment appropriations has certainly reached a worrying level now .
Thank you very much , Mrs Rühle .
Does any Member wish to speak against this proposal ?
As no one wishes to speak , I shall put to the vote the request to postpone the vote .
( Parliament gave its assent to postponing the vote )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Before the vote on Amendment No 2
The change is in the word " continue " .

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Roth-Behrendt Report ( A5-0095 / 2001 ) :
Women must choose between make-up and consideration for animals .
Last night , I was astonished by Mr Fatuzzo 's speech .
This is an issue which concentrates on cruelty towards , and inhumane abuse of , animals .
It is nothing to laugh about .
We should not be making jokes about these issues .
This is an extremely important issue .
They are completely unnecessary .
They also expose babies to unnecessary risks .
I want to re-endorse the fact that this is not a trivial issue .
It is extremely serious .
We really should take account of animal welfare .
It is unjustifiable in the twenty-first century that we are using such prehistoric practices .
It was not the intention of this amendment to wreck the directive .
The United Kingdom has already banned animal testing .
We would like to see that taken forward in a realistic and practical way .
Our group has decided to abstain from the vote for the following reasons :
We are sure the Member States will note the emphatic majority expressed here .
We hope the industry in general will heed these proposals .
Some of its leading practitioners already have .
We believe our proposal will speed up the necessary research , if it is taken seriously .
If that is the case , the tests will be transferred to other countries .
I have based my vote on the recommendations of the " Eurogroup for Animal Welfare " .
Haug report ( A5-0101 / 2001 ) :
The budget itself , as it stands , is too small .
Katiforis report ( A5-0106 / 2001 ) :
Kauppi report ( A5-0105 / 2001 ) :
Sacconi report ( A5-0092 / 2001 ) :
I will willingly contribute to this recycling on condition that my pension is increased " .
Well then , I am putting these proposals to the House .
Because the House has displayed little professional expertise in its voting behaviour .
Allow me to quote a few examples .
The first example is the banning of PVC in buildings .
The claims made here are therefore nonsense .
The same applies to a number of observations regarding incineration .
The negative effects are not apparent until afterwards .
Toxins are released as early as at the production stage and also when substances are added .
Chlorine and dioxins are released during incineration .
I support him in this view , but believe that these proposals are inadequate to actually solve the problem .
Costa Neves report ( A5-0102 / 2001 ) :
I voted against the Costa Neves report on the Commission 's 2002 budget lines .
Madam President , I should be very pleased if the European Commission were given more money for its budget .
Firstly , agriculture .
How can we reconcile these two requirements ?
Secondly , enlargement .
The 2002 budget guidelines seem too sketchy on the cost of enlargement .
The third area is the Treaty of Nice .
Yet , this is missing .
Nonetheless , this is an argument that does not hold water .
Buitenweg report ( A5-0103 / 2001 ) :
Many other small businesses are in the same situation .
What about the others though ?
( The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Discharges ( continuation )
This was hard work for everyone concerned .
This is demonstrated by the detailed questionnaires , but also and above all by the report before us .
Mr Blak , you have a reputation for being a very harsh critic of mismanagement .
The Commission will be taking measures in response to your most important findings .
The basis for the annual discharge procedure is the Court of Auditors ' annual report .
Follow-up actions to this are presented such that they can be verified .
Mrs Rühle has recognised that these are steps in the right direction .
I would also like to thank two other rapporteurs , Mrs van der Laan and Mr Seppänen .
The audit findings here are also very important .
The primary duty of control falls to them .
We have also had detailed discussions in the Ecofin Council on these duties for the Member States .
One such area that I would like to mention here is that of agricultural export refunds .
This sometimes - relatively often even - leads to protracted disputes and sometimes actual litigation .
Cooperation with the legislature is absolutely essential for good financial management .
We must learn from our mistakes .
The decisions concerned were made by the previous Commission between 1991 and 1994 .
Parliament investigated this case very thoroughly .
We all agree that it is not possible to undo what was done at that time .
Many of the arrangements have changed since 1994 .
Mr Blak is pressing here for an improvement in the procedure for drawing up this black list .
I can assure you that we are already working on this .
OLAF would then become the Community 's independent investigatory authority , an important step .
In case of doubt the Commission must decide .
The short answer is " No ! "
It would take a different approach in comparable cases today .
The clear objective of the administrative reform of the Commission is to improve financial management .
This broad spectrum of European funding tasks also includes foreign policy .
That is our criticism of this budgetary procedure .
There has been restructuring within the new Commission .
We shall ensure that this happens .
We want more spending on SYNERGY .
I turn now to the other report on the coal and steel part of the budget .
This causes real problems for those organisations .
We accepted it for 1999 , but I hope it will not recur in the year 2000 .
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation .
This is a trend we desperately need to reverse .
Is this a discharge issue ?
Mrs Schreyer , we insist that the Commission must fulfil these promises .
This will ensure that the poorest people actually receive the aid .
I defy anyone to disagree with that .
This would enable us to target our policies more strongly on this area .
I want to restrict my comments to Freddy Blak 's excellent report on the Commission discharge for 1999 .
1999 - what a year that was .
The error rate quite simply did not improve .
What conclusions should we draw from this ?
How on earth are we going to explain that back home ?
Please do not be scared that by not granting discharge you will cause this Commission to fall .
You simply will not .
There is nothing in the Treaties that says that must happen .
1999 is not the year for which this Commission is responsible .
I also ask you to promise us that the error rate will improve .
Firstly , things have improved .
Secondly , the Commission has carried out some sterling work .
There has been effective consultation between the different rapporteurs and the Commission .
The Commission has taken us seriously .
I would , however , like to draw your attention to a number of aspects .
This Parliament will be voting on this on Thursday .
It is one of the most important recommendations which the Committee of Wise Men have made .
It is also the first reform which is being enshrined in legislation .
The other institutions should take a long and hard look at this too .
Secondly , we need to further refine and further politicise the discharge instrument .
The DAS , the Statement of Assurance , must be improved .
The budget of the Council is taking on ever increasing proportions .
They turned out to be rather lengthy , and got the better of me at times .
I would like to make a few general points .
That is very positive .
I would like to comment on the superlevy in agriculture .
We all know the system of milk quota .
All farmers in Europe pay extra if they produce too much milk .
There is one country which forms an exception to this rule , namely Italy .
The Italian government pays the levy on behalf of the farmers .
Is this not a case of distortion of competition ?
Should the Commission not do something about this promptly ?
I am pleased with the Commissioner ' s reply further to the Fléchard affair .
What is the responsibility of the officials in this respect ?
When should it be assessed by the Commission or Commissioner himself , etc . ?
What are the exact procedures to be followed in those cases ?
There are still many ambiguities surrounding flax .
This will probably not only affect Spain .
My conclusion on behalf of the group is that we will be granting discharge .
The real test for the current Commission will come with the examination of the accounts for 2000 .
We are inclined to grant the Commission discharge for the 1999 budget .
Commissioner , we are extremely dissatisfied with this state of affairs .
This is shoddy work and cannot be taken seriously .
The Member States are still insufficiently aware of the fraud issue .
The Blak report contains many positive statements with regard to the Commission .
You promised a solid basis for the application of the principle of proportionality .
You also promised to change tack as regards debt collection .
There were too many irregularities and the administrative culture it represented was a spurious one .
The situation in 1999 was different .
Responsibility was unevenly divided between Mr Santer ' s Commission that had resigned and the new Commission .
It was hard to say which of them was responsible for what .
Now it is harder to come up with detailed arguments as to why discharge should not be granted .
The majority of our group on this occasion is in favour of granting the Commission discharge .
These have been spoken of with unwarranted sensitivity .
Mr Blak has made a great effort to find answers to quite a few questions .
Commissioner Schreyer stated that a black list of fraudulent businesses had been drawn up .
The Members of this Parliament do , however , reach different conclusions based on facts .
And this is all tied in with the interpretation of the facts and the trust in the Commission .
Interpreting these facts is a great deal harder .
Any other business would be threatened in its very existence .
When it took up office , the Commission had the trust of this Parliament .
Personally speaking , I welcome all of the above .
I shall make three comments on what has happened here this year .
Eighty per cent of the appropriations are still spent by Member States and we grant discharge to the Commission .
We are punishing those who are only partially responsible for what is happening to them .
That does not always happen .
That is what constitutes the real scandal in the Fléchard affair .
It is essential that we correct this imbalance by enhancing our powers of jurisdiction .
But this means that a change of approach is sometimes required too .
Until then , we had been systematically denied access to these reports .
So what information can we glean from these OLAF reports ?
Let 's take the example of adulterated butter .
Or let us take the case of flax .
At first , this focussed solely on Spain .
This is most apparent in the case of the alleged disappearance of files in the Fléchard affair .
This case was approached extremely tentatively .
I can understand that .
This is one explanation , but it is no justification .
It is the Commission 's credibility , not least , which is at stake here .
What are these issues ?
Let me sum them up in four key phrases .
The first is the Fléchard case .
Ms Schreyer , you have just stated clearly that the Commission would not proceed in this way today .
I am gratified to hear it .
It would have made things much easier for us - for both sides - if you had done so .
My second key phrase is the Statement of Assurance .
No , we want tangible results .
The DAS must be positive by 2002 .
This House is prepared to work with the Commission and the Court of Auditors to achieve this goal .
The third key phrase is access to information .
Many people 's hopes of the Framework Agreement between the Commission and Parliament have been disappointed .
Yet the Commission still failed to provide all the information requested .
Ultimately , Ms Schreyer , the Commission is cutting off its nose to spite its face .
The previous speakers have also raised this issue .
Ms Schreyer , I asked you about this issue during the last part-session .
Will I finally get a clear statement from you today ?
The Committee on Budgetary Control has submitted five other reports on discharge .
I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs on their excellent work .
Ms Stauner 's follow-up report on the 1998 discharge should be singled out in particular .
Mr Folias ' report is considered and coherent .
It contains no proposed amendments .
I should like to express my great appreciation of , and agreement with , the content of his report .
The reports by Ms van der Laan and Mr Seppänen were approved and adopted by the Committee .
This may not apply to all the Groups here in this Chamber .
But I think it is appropriate to point this out .
A word to the Commission .
In my view , the PPE-DE must clarify its own position on this issue too .
I have a number of responses to the points raised by Mr Heaton-Harris .
But the point of relevance to Parliament as an institution is that it has not done so .
If there are any error rates , we expect a clear statement from the Court of Auditors .
You are absolutely right on this point .
Here , too , I must remind you that there are different views on this issue within your group .
Then he should come .
I interpret your words as self-criticism on the part of the Commission .
I have approached this report via the flax issue .
But we are in danger of overplaying our hand .
I also want to refer to the question of the Statement of Assurance and discharge .
The Court of Auditors was set up to apply accountancy procedures .
It looks at the way money is spent .
We have an entirely different responsibility .
But we can work towards it and we are getting there .
I will start off with the Scandinavian countries .
The administration of the Stockholm office has proved to be scandalous .
As Niels Busk stated , there have also been considerable problems in Denmark .
I have tried not to get involved in an internal Spanish quarrel .
We shall never discover more than we know now .
OLAF , the expert committee and the Court of Auditors have looked at the case .
And what did we learn ?
We learned that the Delors Commission made a decision for which there was no legal basis .
If OLAF cannot find them , then how should MEPs be able to ?
For some people it is a way of life to be at cross purposes and oppose everything .
That is fine , and I accept that , as I also accept them as very good colleagues .
Mr President , with just one minute , I must be absolutely specific .
I am referring to the SYNERGY Programme .
There is a difference of opinion over the Programme 's minimum threshold .
Firstly , how will the Commission deal with uncovered or suspected fraud ?
Of course , the individual factors are also important .
We have just been talking about the blacklist .
But I should mention at the same time that this is a Council regulation .
It remains to be seen how the debate on this issue will continue .
Various procedures are applied which vary in their speed and thoroughness .
So the issue of a European public prosecutor is still on the agenda , of course .
A further point which was raised was the execution of the budget .
Last year , for example , the budget for the Structural Funds was very poorly implemented .
That goes without saying .
Mr Blak 's report makes this very clear .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
The next item is the Commission statement on foot-and-mouth disease .
The outbreak started with two cases detected on 20 February .
As we speak , the total number of cases in the UK stands at over 900 .
The situation in the other affected Member States is fortunately not as serious .
All Member States are putting huge resources into combating the current outbreak .
The Commission 's strategy towards the crisis has been to act decisively and quickly .
Our aim is to assist the Member States to eradicate foot-and-mouth disease .
There is a consensus on this objective .
There are also innumerable daily contacts and information exchanges with and between the Member States .
We are acting urgently on all new information .
There have been no fewer than 18 decisions adopted by the Commission since the outbreak of this crisis .
We are acting with as much transparency as possible .
This is my third appearance in Parliament to update you on developments .
Where possible , we are adopting a regionalised approach to any new outbreaks .
I repeat my call on them to lift unnecessary and unjustified restrictions .
I will now turn to the full range of Community measures in place .
This has proven essential to avoid the possible further spread of the disease on the continent .
I will now turn to Community measures in relation to individual Member States .
These restrictions are adapted as circumstances change .
The existing restrictions in relation to Ireland remain in place until 19 April .
That summarises the situation insofar as restrictions on exports and movements of animals are concerned .
I would now like to turn to two other important measures adopted in recent days .
The decision in relation to the Netherlands provides for suppressive vaccination .
Accordingly , it is entirely appropriate to allow vaccination to take place in these circumstances .
The decision in relation to the United Kingdom is more complex .
As we speak , the Standing Veterinary Committee is discussing that particular request .
I fully appreciate that vaccination is a very emotive subject .
It certainly appears as an attractive alternative to killing and destroying animals .
But the reality is far different .
The reality is that it is a complex issue with formidable challenges .
I have spoken to you before of some of these challenges .
Let me now repeat them .
There is no approved test to distinguish individually vaccinated animals from infected animals .
This allows the disease to continue to persist in the animal population .
There are seven serotypes of FMD , each with several sub-strains .
Vaccination is only effective against the targeted strain and for a limited period only .
But there are other wider issues which will also need to be considered .
There has already been good progress in this area and it needs to be intensified .
However , these issues can only be addressed when the current crisis has been brought under control .
I hope that this will take place sooner rather than later .
Thank you for your attention and I now look forward to hearing your views .
In my own country , we are now talking in terms of more than EUR 100 million .
This also applies to the rural areas which are far removed from the affected area .
I would therefore like to ask the Commission the following questions .
Vaccination is not as simple as some suggest .
That clear message should go out from this Parliament .
There is no threat to human health .
I welcome the commitment of the Commissioner to look at all these and other factors .
Pontificating on instant solutions in advance of an inquiry will not be helpful .
What would the implications be if we were to abandon the current policy ?
What are the effects on markets in Europe ?
What would be the implications on the income of the farming families if we were to abandon this policy ?
This message must be driven home .
I would now like to draw your attention to another aspect .
At the moment , we are exercising extremely strict control at airports and other entry points .
This should not be a temporary but permanent measure .
The Commissioner talked about the transport policy in Europe .
I would like to finish off on a minor point .
Farmers have been unable to deliver milk for some days in various countries .
Is it possible that the Commission could revise its decision to adjust their quota downwards ?
The days on which they were unable to deliver should be added to their quota .
We have the impression that it comes rather too late .
Perhaps these measures should have been adopted in " peace-time " , if I can call it that .
But , of course , the key question now is : culling or vaccination ?
And what happens to the animals after they have been vaccinated ?
But they do not export the disease .
Vaccination is not just an emotive issue ....
( The President cut the speaker off ) ( Applause )
I do not believe that we are out of the woods yet .
Putting our money on the economy from the outset would have been the right approach .
It is estimated that around 200 million livestock are moved around the EU every year .
Traceability in this commercial chain , especially in the necessary chronological order , is always problematical and uncertain .
Beef consumption has decreased by 50 per cent .
This makes sense , as cattle sales have been stopped .
Even relatives are staying at home .
Patching this up through a " rural renewal " programme could take years .
After all , cattle cannot be produced overnight .
This is the situation that has been described to us .
I therefore feel that the initiatives implemented to date are not sufficient .
Confidence cannot be bought by decree - it has to be earned .
An appropriate media campaign should be launched to restore this confidence .
Our exports are paralysed by poorly targeted embargoes .
The Commission failed in its negotiations with the United States .
The Russian and Japanese markets are also out of bounds .
What did the negotiations achieve ?
The European Union must adopt a strong position on regional policy .
Systematic culling causes both the ruin of the farmers involved and the destruction of genetic heritage .
Furthermore , psychological counselling facilities should be set up as soon as possible .
We must show unwavering solidarity in the light of this human tragedy .
Foot-and-mouth disease has arrived just in time for eastward enlargement and for the WTO negotiations .
Quite simply by cutting our numbers of farmers and livestock .
And how can we cut our numbers of farmers and livestock ?
The world is on red alert and yet the European Union does not flinch .
What we should do is vaccinate .
So , what do we do ?
We do not vaccinate .
But then , although farmers leave farming , the budget savings that we need can be achieved .
In the wake of the BSE crisis , foot-and-mouth disease has given rise to a total of three miracles .
The first miracle is that there are fewer budgetary obstacles standing in the path of eastward enlargement .
All of this happened by chance , of course .
It is by chance that we have allowed the disease to spread .
It is by chance that , for ten years , we have done nothing to combat BSE .
It is by chance that the United States has a stranglehold over the world ' s media .
So , Mr President , you must appoint Mr Chance European Commissioner alongside Mr Pascal Lamy .
What will need to be done ?
Who cannot see that this arbitrary rule blatantly favours the United States ?
We must also take a regionalist approach .
This role must be fully acknowledged under the common policy .
( Applause from the right )
And we will push for this with all our energy and determination .
The industry is destabilised and under threat .
Commissioner , this is an exceptional situation .
We must deal with it in an exceptional manner .
I hope it is .
We therefore have to look to the future .
At least there should not be any kind of financial incentive for it .
One problem concerns animal auctions , especially those involving bull calves .
I think these should be abolished altogether .
I would also like to stress the importance of a policy of prevention .
I would appreciate clarification by the Commission on this point .
But Ireland is paying an enormous price for this single incident .
Are the inspection procedures and sampling arrangements at import points into the Union adequate ?
I ask today are we satisfied that enough is being done ?
( The President cut the speaker off )
Cows , sheep and pigs are more than production units .
They are God ' s creatures in relation to which we need to act as responsible stewards .
The non-vaccination policy was based on a restricted outbreak every 5 to 10 years .
The present epidemic is anything but restricted .
The non-vaccination policy is therefore based on false scenarios and must be reviewed .
I call on the Commission to consider the ethical dimension of its policy .
Healthy , vaccinated animals could be kept for the internal market .
They reluctantly agreed to comply with that request and the slaughter of healthy animals has begun .
This sort of dithering has been an element which has been obvious throughout this whole disease .
It dithered whether to use incineration instead of burial .
Now it is dithering over vaccination .
Let me say this afternoon that vaccination is not the right way forward .
Vaccination is not a sensible way forward just now during the epidemic .
They have nevertheless had six outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease .
In the case of pigs it can take 7 days .
During that time they can spread the virus .
I would pose one question to Mr Byrne before I finish .
He was talking about whole areas of Holland , France and Ireland where restrictions will be lifted .
Will similar restrictions be lifted in areas of the United Kingdom not affected by the disease ?
I take an entirely different view .
So now is the time for you to adopt a different course of action .
Why do you not say : live transports are banned ?
Every live transport must be granted an exemption .
Why can animals not be transported after slaughter ?
And finally : tell us , what have you got against giraffes ?
Many people have asked me that question : what has the Commissioner got against giraffes ?
Why is he stopping the safari parks from vaccinating to prevent disease ?
So tell us , Mr Byrne : please tell us , what have you got against giraffes ?
Please be so kind , take the measures today .
Be more courageous today , do not wait until tomorrow .
Commissioner , thank you for your contribution .
People in my country no longer accept this .
Other sectors of the economy too have ground to a halt .
The damage caused in those sectors is many times more serious .
Commissioner Byrne ' s attitude is brutally inadequate .
Mr Byrne should have taken the initiative to vaccinate animals in zoos .
Instead , he did nothing .
Mr Byrne could have taken the initiative to vaccinate rare animals roaming freely .
Ministers Künast and Brinkhorst took the initiative instead .
Mr Byrne should have taken the initiative in respect of generous buffer vaccination .
Export interests are not sacrosanct .
Let the affected countries vaccinate their animals to their heart ' s content and not sacrifice animals unnecessarily .
I would like to make three brief points .
The second point relates to the agricultural sector .
Thirdly , we need flexible policies .
In the battle against the virus , all means must be deployed .
The European non-vaccination policy is now turning out to be a self-imposed handicap .
However , the downside of the non-vaccination policy is also making itself felt now .
I am quoting animal welfare in this connection .
The destruction or evacuation of healthy animals is meeting with enormous resistance .
I am also quoting animals in zoos .
Furthermore , you are calling the effectiveness into question .
Commissioner , the situation is very serious indeed .
We call for a joint approach . Hence , I would like to put two pressing questions to you .
First of all , at what stage will you recognise that the European strategy has failed ?
They want the animals in their zoo , Artis , to be vaccinated .
I should like to offer you these signatures , and I hope for a positive response to their request .
It is being asked for today in this House .
A decision on vaccination is not easy .
It is costing far more in lost business .
I would ask the Commissioner three questions .
Are you satisfied with the UK 's response to this disease ?
Are you satisfied that other countries have adequate contingency plans ?
In the longer term , Europe 's farming must become less dependent on international trade and more self-reliant .
That is what this crisis of foot-and-mouth disease signifies .
This illogical approach is intolerable .
What you cannot do is address both issues in the same way .
This is unacceptable .
You must tell us what you think about vaccination .
I should also like to ask you why animals are being slaughtered once they have been vaccinated .
Mr President , Commissioner , I believe we should revisit vaccination policy .
Mrs Roth-Behrendt is right .
We should do this today , and not tomorrow .
This is why we need to reconsider all the factors involved , including the human dimension .
Then there is the aspect of animal welfare .
It appears that the scientific arguments are still not fully concluded .
Just add up all the costs of these crises combined .
It is only a matter of time before the first reports on smuggling will start to roll in .
All these aspects should therefore be considered .
After all , people , especially in my country , are increasingly mystified by your policy .
You will therefore need to carefully explain what it is all about .
The positions are shifting .
When will we be able to hold a debate on this subject at the highest level ?
Lastly , I wish to emphasise the urgency of adopting a decision on the strategy that we should follow .
If there were simple solutions to this tragedy , we would have found them by now .
We applaud them for what they did .
We have suffered greatly from that .
Would the Commissioner confirm that this is essentially a crisis of movement ?
Would a carcass trade not be better for Europe to be considering ?
The tragedy faced by the farmers needs more than headlines .
The survival of a profession is at stake .
The situation in the regions where there have been outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease is critical .
I believe that we must continue to cull if we wish to regain our disease-free status .
I also hope that the Commission , but above all the Member States , fulfil their responsibilities .
This hygiene problem is a matter of acceptance in the Member States .
The option , therefore , of vaccination has to be kept open in the interests of the wider community .
I said this last month .
The current Draconian restrictions on people 's movements cannot continue .
It is for politicians to make these balanced choices .
Could this outbreak have been prevented ?
Will consumers lose confidence in our food ?
Are our rules and regulations concerning animal movement and animal traceability all that they should be ?
There will be more time for those later .
In the last 18 months , 34 countries have reported outbreaks .
I am referring specifically to firebreak vaccination .
Our overseas markets are seriously threatened and we have only one case of it .
In conclusion , we are only spending 1 % of the 1.2 % of GDP currently available .
There are other measures that can help compensate sectors generally in terms of our budget .
The EU 's " no vaccination " policy has always been justified in terms of exports to third countries .
The Commission should put these figures on the table for the Council .
Put the figures on the table , and do it quickly .
Then the Council can decide , and the Council can take responsibility for its policies .
The European Parliament will undoubtedly set out its views on this issue in its resolution tomorrow .
I believe that the current situation is putting untold emotional and psychological strain on farmers .
What about Europe 's moral responsibility for its policies ?
Thank you .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon .
Mr Böge has the floor for a point of order .
I would be grateful if we could receive a comprehensive report at the next Committee meeting .
Thank you very much , Mr Böge .
Mr Posselt has the floor for a point of order .
After all , it was scheduled for 6 p.m.
Report on the preparations for the introduction of euro notes and coins
Commissioner Solbes has the floor .
There is absolutely no doubt that the introduction of the euro is going to be an historic event .
The framework of preparations presents a situation which I would call unequal .
There is plenty of documentation , but that documentation is not always read .
This will contribute to consumers being progressively more involved in the new situation we are creating .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
Do you not think that specific measures need to be adopted ?
My obligation is to resolve the problems and view the difficulties rather coolly and with a certain distance .
I believe that we may have a distorted view of reality .
I am not yet able to offer you a definitive solution .
And I would say the same to the respective ministers in relation to their national programmes .
The national programmes are all being discussed in the Commission .
Mr President , Commissioner , I have two brief questions .
Do you plan to launch a specific initiative here ?
I believe that , on the whole , things are going well .
We still have a few months left .
Of course , we could lend them a helping hand , and I have two suggestions in that respect .
Foreign coins must be spent , and it is vital for people to know this before the summer .
So I would advise you to give them plenty of warning about this .
That is better than simply binning them .
Mr President , I would like to say the following to Mrs Randzio-Plath :
Campaigns have not only been carried out in accordance with calendar years .
Whether or not there are fiscal advantages is to be decided by the Member States .
With regard to currencies , what you say is clear .
The people there will then suddenly be confronted with the euro from one day to the next as well .
So my question is : How do you intend to provide information in these countries ?
Are you working with their national banks ?
Should they perhaps operate as issuing offices as well ?
I think there is a significant need for action in this area .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
This item is closed .
Question Time ( Commission )
The next item is Question Time ( B5-0163 / 2001 ) . We will examine questions to the Commission .
Question No 29 by ( H-0263 / 01 ) :
The data gathered will be used to advocate better protection and programming on the ground .
Question No 30 by ( H-0300 / 01 ) :
Operating conditions in the northern Caucasus remain difficult , especially in terms of security .
Commissioner , thank you for your answer , although I think it is slightly elusive .
We are also funding the logistic operation of food and medicine into Chechnya .
The priorities on which we are working are the right ones .
I am not going to repeat the numbers of refugees in the different regions .
They are not our own figures .
They are from the various international forganisations working on this .
We are directing our assistance to areas with the largest concentration of people in need .
Finding the right channels to do that is not very easy .
Question No 31 by ( H-0260 / 01 ) :
How many studies have been conducted in this area ?
As part of this debate , we will look into alternative fuels .
Almost all alternative fuels have been covered in these projects .
Commissioner , I mainly wanted to talk about the last point on patents .
This is a proposal that we have supported and which is currently being put into practice .
What part does intellectual property play in this matter ?
We would like to reiterate that the WTO agreement on intellectual property stipulates this flexibility .
The legal provisions , which Mrs Carlotti mentioned , do not therefore present an obstacle .
It is the ways in which they may be interpreted that could pose a problem .
We have clearly stated our own interpretation .
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his very thorough answer and for his interpretation .
I think that we are on the same wavelength on this issue .
As they deal with the same subject , Questions No 33 and 34 will be taken together .
Question No 33 by ( H-0279 / 01 ) :
The industry does however depend on research to remain competitive .
I would , therefore , like to explain the action that we have taken .
The report recommends setting up an Advisory Council for Aeronautical Research in Europe or ACAR .
A first draft strategic agenda is expected at the beginning of next year .
It is therefore quite acceptable that these research projects form part of this objective .
Thank you very much , Mr Busquin .
Question No 35 by ( H-0266 / 01 ) :
There is an ongoing debate in Denmark about Denmark ' s position .
The question is what a development of the Schengen acquis means .
Question No 36 by ( H-0276 / 01 ) :
There is contradictory information about what will happen in the meantime .
The only document Swedish citizens have which indicates their citizenship is their passport .
It should be noted that the Schengen acquis does not stipulate the type of identity document required .
I would thank the Commissioner for his answer .
Is that correct ?
I am afraid that , probably due to the translation , the situation is not clear at all .
I am sorry I do not share your point of view .
I know your political view on this issue and you know mine .
Have I understood correctly ?
I cannot interpret Mr Vitorino ' s answer in any other way .
There is not a specific indication of nationality in that document .
Question No 37 by ( H-0311 / 01 ) :
These individuals must be in possession of a certificate issued by a competent national authority .
This is the uniform implementation of a decision of the Schengen Executive Committee .
I am surprised to hear the Commissioner ' s answer .
What I can say to you is that the Commission supports the Italian initiative .
Its operating budget will also be set .
Mr President , Commissioner , thank you for your very precise and competent answer .
Yes , I wholeheartedly agree with you .
I certainly recall the European Parliament ' s proposal .
I hope that we will be able to approve the Italian proposal as soon as possible .
As you know , the proposals had to be tabled by 31 March .
The Management Committee will now meet and make a decision .
I hope that the proposal will be approved , so that it can be implemented during 2001 .
Question No 39 by ( H-0249 / 01 ) :
The European Union very much welcomes that agreement .
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is moving towards Europe .
The European Union has been intensively involved in trying to manage and prevent this crisis .
My latest trip to Skopje was yesterday .
I went for the second time in about ten days with the High Representative .
It was his third trip in that period .
We are very pleased at the attempt made by President Trajkovski to launch a process of dialogue in Skopje .
The first meeting of the political leaders that he brought together took place yesterday .
We had individual meetings with all the party leaders .
All of them expressed their commitment to democracy .
All of them expressed their commitment to dialogue .
All of them expressed their commitment to joining the European family .
So we now look to them to make good the undertakings that they gave us yesterday .
Commissioner , thank you very much for your detailed reply .
I would like to go further than that , if I may .
That is the path to Europe .
But I want to go further .
There is not just one Presevo Valley in the southeast of Europe .
There are , in political terms , figuratively several .
So if you start fiddling with the borders here you end up fiddling with the borders everywhere .
I endorse what the honourable Member says , but I would go a stage further .
They assured us that they were stepping up security on the border .
They are committing more troops .
They are making a greater effort .
So yes , I hope KFOR will be able to do more .
It is a difficult job but one which I hope they will be able to do even better .
As the author is not present , Question No 40 lapses .
Question No 41 by ( H-0274 / 01 ) :
The situation of women in Saudi Arabia is a matter of very considerable concern .
I referred to , for example , the special report by Amnesty International .
So the honourable Member is right to raise the issue .
Question No 42 by ( H-0277 / 01 ) :
It would also run against Russia 's stated policy in the region .
The Russian side firmly denied the allegations which had been published in the media .
The Russian side gave assurances that there were no plans regarding the deployment of nuclear weapons in Kaliningrad .
I have seen the press and broadcast reports to which the honourable Member draws attention .
I should like to thank Commissioner Patten for that clear answer .
I did not agree with those remarks of President Putin .
We thank Mr Patten for his cooperation and we wish him success in the Balkans .
That concludes Questions to the Commission .
( The sitting was suspended at 8.00 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
The third perspective is to overcome obstacles and access problems .
The fourth perspective is that of consultation and information .
On the basis of these perspectives , we put together a number of proposals .
This also involves mutual recognition of cards carried by people with disabilities throughout the Union .
The issue of access should also be extended to education .
We all know that disabled people are not fully or properly integrated into school life .
The issue of access also includes transport and public buildings .
We heard a speech made by Brian Crowley at the inauguration of this building .
In this respect , we can announce a forthcoming directive , for example with regard to lifts .
I hope that , in this directive , mandatory standards can be specified for disabled people .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mrs Hermange on an excellent report .
I would also like to congratulate her for making it available in braille and through sign language interpreters .
That is what we are aiming to achieve .
Let us hope that this report , together with the employment directive , will address that issue .
We must look at all the issues .
I can bring hundreds of examples of discrimination , of ignorance , thousands of examples of prejudice .
It seems to me to be extremely important that 2003 be declared European Year of Disabled Citizens .
She has been exemplary in the way she has attended to her task as rapporteur .
People with disabilities are discriminated against today .
There is clear discrimination in this area . The same applies to the labour market .
Unemployment among people with disabilities is very high .
We must adopt a pro-active attitude , for all this can be prevented .
Disability is not a static phenomenon .
It is the environment which is at fault , and this can be changed .
Nowadays , we have interpretation using sign language , for example .
We can design buildings and workplaces differently , making them more accessible to people with disabilities .
This is something which is possible to implement , because it is about changes to the environment .
We can implement changes .
The change must affect all areas of policy , moreover .
I myself come from the world of education .
That is incredibly important if attitudes are to be changed .
Professional integration is therefore associated with social integration .
I can only see two shortcomings .
Mr President , have you seen how we all agree on this issue ?
In your opinion , who is responsible for this , Commissioner Diamantopoulou ?
And that means the Swedish Presidency , which we all consider to be one of the most enlightened .
They are the true disabled in this European society .
This new concept should also inform corresponding policies in the Member States .
The point is whether or not the Member States are mature enough to look at it from this angle .
It is no easy task .
And how can we not condemn the derisory amount that those who are unable to work receive in benefits ?
When it comes to commercial contracts , however , legislators know how to impose tough rules .
First , the endeavour concerning the rights of airline passengers .
Nonetheless , I think that there are several specific issues worth mentioning here , such as legislation .
Finally , I must say that 2003 will really be a big challenge .
At present we are discussing the political framework for 2003 .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Diamantopoulou .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Public health action programme ( 2001-2006 )
This will ensure that all the objectives are achieved in the best way possible .
Another factor which I consider extremely important is the budget .
There must always be a correspondence between the objectives set and the means available to achieve them .
Our health systems are usually gender-blind .
National reports rarely include a breakdown by gender .
The new Public Health Action Programme can pave the way in this regard .
Every 20 minutes , a woman dies of breast cancer in Europe .
It affects one woman in nine .
The probability of contracting this disease increases from year to year .
Yet if it is detected in time and properly treated , breast cancer is curable .
So here too , best practice is imperative .
Here , I support the rapporteur 's proposed amendment .
In this way , the limited available resources could be used sensibly and in a targeted way .
Under the new programme , three global objectives replace the eight programmes currently in operation .
It could have expressed a lot more in the way of hopes for the future .
I think the rapporteur has seen to it that it covers the whole issue , however .
In this respect we face some very demanding challenges .
Let us just think about the food we eat , for example .
We think this is essential .
I believe that this is a fine report and that its deserves Parliament ' s support tomorrow .
He is fully correct in his approach .
Public health is national policy , and it should remain that way .
Various diseases can be controlled effectively by means of relatively few resources .
The week before last , in Parliament , we were launching the epilepsy White Paper .
As we discuss this report this evening we should never forget this .
With this programme we can directly add value to the lives of European Union citizens .
By taking a horizontal approach to public health , we can make the best use of limited resources .
With a rapid reaction unit to tackle communicable disease we can act much more effectively .
With more health information for our citizens , quality of life will surely improve .
In conclusion , health connects with the citizen .
We must deliver on health and well-being .
After all , colleagues , the European elections are not far away .
Second , anticipating and reacting quickly to major threats to health .
We can therefore accept , in full , 61 amendments .
With so many amendments , it is not feasible for me to make specific comments on each of them .
First , the scope and structure of the programme .
Events in recent years have clearly demonstrated the need to retain such flexibility .
Consequently , it is important to focus on key priorities where real added value can be produced .
These are matters for the Member States .
Therefore , this amendment is acceptable only in part .
Without any doubt the issue is a priority for the three institutions in this process .
Let me be very clear about our position on this .
I also agree that this must be under the auspices of the Commission .
In particular , it infringes on the Commission 's right to determine its own organisation .
That brings me to the third point - the budget .
The Commission 's proposal is for a total budget of EUR 300 million over a period of six years .
The decision on this is for the Council and the European Parliament , as the budgetary authority .
At this stage I would simply say that the Commission is keeping to its original proposal .
It is clear that any proposals to add to the actions foreseen will have budgetary implications .
Amendments Nos 42 and 73 call for a mixed committee combining management and advisory procedures .
From our existing public health programmes we have experience of working with a mixed committee .
Furthermore this is in line with the Council Decision 1999 / 468 .
Therefore the Commission can accept these amendments .
However , Amendment No 74 specifies a large number of tasks for the committee to perform in management mode .
Therefore I can only accept it in part .
In summary , for the reasons I have set out , 28 amendments are not acceptable .
I repeat my appreciation for all the constructive work that the rapporteur and the committee have put in .
Many of the amendments will improve this proposal .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Byrne .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions :
Nobody questions the Commission ' s duty to pursue alleged infringements of Community Law .
All interpretation based on economic criteria should be excluded .
Firstly , the problem of Community legislation .
We are discussing one of these communications today .
Liberalisation - i.e. the abolition of monopolies - is one of the EU 's success stories .
But there is a substantial danger here .
Were it Justinian , of course , it would have been a different matter .
This matter is particularly relevant to investments in privatisation conducted by Member States .
Intra-EU investment has been increasing by staggering proportions over the last few years .
Such is the success of the European economic project and the establishment of the euro .
However , one can always seek improvements .
This dismantling has only been pursued with great political courage and with grave political risks .
In its 1997 communication , the Commission established its guidelines for the existence of these legal assurances .
None of these cases has , as yet , come to a conclusion .
I am speaking on behalf of the Italian radicals .
This would be abuse of a dominant position , State aid .
This is why I have some reservations about the resolution to be put to the vote on Thursday .
This is the root of the matter .
I cannot see it that way .
The source of law is the Treaty .
The Treaty is clear .
The Commission is the guardian of the Treaty and universally recognised as such .
It did not do so without reason .
I shall refer to two particular instances .
At the time , in 1991 , this was known as the " Lilley doctrine " .
The Commission took energetic action . The United Kingdom changed its policy .
The second instance is a more recent one .
That is what is laid down in the interpretative communication .
That is the reason for the interpretative communication .
That is the responsibility of the Court of Justice .
That is what the Commission has done .
No , the Commission is merely interpreting and stating what the law is .
That is the reason why it has taken some Member States to court .
Hopefully we will soon see what the Court of Justice has to say .
I was asked if I would issue a directive .
There is no need for a directive .
We have a treaty .
The Commission interprets the treaty and the Court of Justice decides .
So we do not need a directive .
Having said all that , the Commission is due to have a debate on this whole issue shortly .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Bolkestein .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
The debate is closed .
( The sitting was suspended at 11.15 p.m. )
I shall do as you have just suggested .
Statement by the President
Outcome of the European Council of 23 / 24 March 2001 in Stockholm including the situation in the Middle East
This was a very encouraging meeting and confirmed Russia 's strategic role .
Indeed , President Putin assured us that Russia and the European Union share common values .
The position recently adopted by the United States on the environment is worrying .
Firstly , we still need to improve skills and training in information technology .
Secondly , the Galileo programme .
This means that the Member States no longer have any reason to hesitate .
Thirdly , the financial markets .
For some time , the Commission has been arguing for an integrated Europe-wide financial market .
We need a regulatory system which makes it possible for us to keep pace with this rapidly changing market .
Fourthly , the Community patent .
I sincerely hope that this situation can be resolved .
Fifthly , the single European sky .
For its part , the Commission will do all it can to help resolve this problem quickly .
Moreover , the two Member States have agreed to resume discussions on the matter .
Sixthly , postal services .
Moreover , in future , the Commission will incorporate sustainable development into its annual spring report .
The surest way to lose that support is to increase the number of unfulfilled promises .
We have got to close the gap between rhetoric and reality in Europe .
( Applause )
That is a good sign .
I hope that future presidencies will follow your example .
But do not rejoice too quickly ; we still have a few words of criticism .
But first let me stress once again how delighted we are that you are here .
But , hopefully , today marks the start for you .
We are , in fact , in the process of negotiating access to documents .
Please do something in this regard .
A little more modesty would do us good .
When you choose such ambitious words , then you must expect to be judged by your actions .
It is a partnership of negation and blockade !
That is not how we see the Franco-German partnership .
( Applause )
On the contrary , you prefer intergovernmental collaboration .
We get blockades .
( Applause )
We are absolutely delighted that progress has been made on the question of the investment market and financial services .
We shall insist on this and these remarks are addressed to both institutions , the Council and the Commission .
A word of criticism on the question of foreign policy problems , Mr President of the European Council .
Yesterday , the widow of Andrey Sakharov , Yelena Bonner , visited our Group .
That is totally unacceptable as far as we are concerned .
We would have welcomed an immediate contradiction from you in front of the media !
( Applause )
But that is not the point right now .
If we fail there , we might as well give up any claim to involvement in world politics !
We must set out our priorities in Europe , especially in the former Yugoslavia .
That brings me to my final point .
The American President , George W. Bush , will be with you in Gothenburg .
We criticise this as emphatically as we know how .
But burden sharing also applies to environmental protection .
We cannot leave a few countries to shoulder the responsibility while others shrug it off .
Burden sharing also applies to environmental policy .
( Applause )
I wish this success on both you and us .
( Applause )
I congratulate him on this agreement .
Despite that , I believe we are on the right road .
We must take the citizens into account and the obligation to provide services of general interest .
We do not want to see public monopolies being replaced by private monopolies .
This problem faces us too , now that we are debating the status of the political parties .
It is what is called ' soft money ' and ' hard money ' .
For us it is essential that there should not be unlimited economic powers .
Lastly , allow me to speak of the future of Europe .
Yet a debate is something more than just a web page .
The Swedish Presidency should consider , support and improve this proposal at the Gothenburg European Council .
On that point , we can all learn from Sweden .
That is something which must be changed .
In Macedonia , we sincerely hope for success in ensuring greater equality for the Albanians .
That is the only way to peace .
That is more important than anything else for securing peace , freedom and prosperity in Europe .
It is high time we put our minds to the problem .
The significance of this resolution is a clear political signal to both the Council and the Commission .
You only have to read the latest report from the European Environment Agency .
Mr Bolkestein , what are we doing about company tax and the Primarolo group ?
Our future depends on it too .
And will we , Parliament , be waiting , arms at the ready ?
It is those three countries which are the villains in the negotiations concerning transparency .
This is something of which the public in our countries should be aware .
How can a German , Green foreign minister accept responsibility for secrecy ?
The Council ' s new rules on confidentiality are clearly unlawful .
The new rules directly interfere with the section in the Treaty of Amsterdam promising new rules on transparency .
Nor has the Swedish Presidency submitted the rules to the European Parliament .
In my view , the President of the Commission is crying over spilt milk .
Commissioner Nielson made no response .
What is currently happening in Chechnya is an outrage .
We must make political investments , Mr President-in-Office .
In Stockholm , the brakes were applied .
In this sense , the lack of agreement on Community patents is disappointing .
Considering the meagre results , one might wonder what an unsuccessful summit looks like .
The 15-page conclusion document mainly describes decisions intended to be taken at a later date .
I think that the Council should evaluate and consider what role these summits should have .
The European economy flagging is no reason to stop the reform .
Instead one has to put in more effort to be able to achieve competitiveness and increased wellbeing .
I have two questions for the Council ' s acting president .
My second question concerns enlargement .
Will you succeed with your goals ?
What is actually meant by a ' political breakthrough ' in the negotiations ?
We need to make it tighter and more dynamic and Stockholm has added another brick to this edifice .
We must hold on to this , otherwise there will be no further progress .
We must also anchor this in specific basic aspects of economic policy for the year 2001 .
I think we need to invest still more in people and better quality jobs .
But where are they when it comes to the financial action plan and the regulation of investment markets ?
We here in the European Parliament want the rights which the Council already enjoys .
In this respect our Group is critical , as it sees that the results are poor .
That is why our assessment is critical and we think the results are poor .
This is the view taken by many fellow MEPs .
I would add that the Europe of the Member States is not sufficiently European .
There is also the Europe of the regions which remains hidden away .
This is where Europe , and also the Member States , fail to come up to scratch .
We have already mentioned Macedonia .
It is necessary for everyone to be aware that the existence of second-class citizens always leads to difficulties .
But we are lacking in commitment to the right to self-determination on the part of the Palestinians .
We do not exert enough pressure to obtain peace .
The social issues , particularly the question of unemployment , were hardly touched upon .
However , there are two different forms of employment policy .
These are two different areas of policy .
I would like to see actual measures for the unemployed .
It is not yet too late as the Swedish Presidency still has a few months left to run .
He is right .
Mr President , a political paradox of the highest order .
The symbolism is crystal clear .
Is this symbolism , employed by Europe , misleading and , therefore , dangerous ?
The European Council ' s lucid explanation in Stockholm seems to contradict this negative interpretation .
The role of NATO in this European policy on crisis management is unmistakable .
However , this encouraging note is not in accordance with the press information I received yesterday .
Stockholm was like a mini Nice , without the squabbles .
I would nonetheless like to mention one positive decision that was taken at Stockholm .
[ And in Swedish : Sweden is always welcome to join the club . ]
Our Group , undoubtedly like many others here , welcomes this arrest with open arms .
It must have been an extremely difficult situation to deal with .
There was a great deal of tangible tension .
Needless to say , the early warning systems are still not fully functioning .
We probably could have reacted more promptly in a number of areas .
Once again , the Association Agreement too could be an excellent tool in this respect .
This brings me to my third point .
This is a crucial point for us .
Which brings me to my final point .
It is a ' global village ' , and we rely on global partnership .
In that respect , a unilateral withdrawal from Kyoto cannot be accepted .
Stockholm was supposed to be about the creation of a competitive Europe .
No , unfortunately not enough , as the President of the Council himself has admitted .
Reform of the EU is going too slowly .
Mr President , this is about democratic support and openness .
The Swedish Presidency has an overall vision of bringing the Union closer to its citizens .
This is an excellent ambition .
Finally , I would like to point out we are now halfway through the Swedish Presidency .
Liberalisation alone will not help us reach our pretty meagre Kyoto targets .
How will this ensure its sustainable development in future ?
Sustainability is not just a domestic issue .
It is an international and inter-generational concept .
We must do something to restore the possibility of peace and put an end to the cycle of violence .
( The President cut the speaker off )
It is pointless to attempt to achieve a stable European Union without a genuine , effective foreign policy .
I have a second question .
The European Council was founded so that the Heads of State or Government could discuss fundamental questions .
Now there are sometimes 30 , 40 or 50 items on the agenda .
The third point that I wish to address concerns the Council itself .
I would also like to congratulate him on a successful meeting in Stockholm .
I will concentrate on the Lisbon Process .
However , this depends on how the meeting of the European Council is perceived .
We can never create a Europe for its citizens if these ingredients are not also present .
Mrs Carlsson said that the Social Democrats in Europe were having a difficult time of it .
In Sweden , we have combined unemployment targets and employment targets .
It is important that we have achieved this .
All these ingredients were present at the Stockholm Summit .
This was the first stage of a process which will go on for many years .
Link this to the open coordination method and we will achieve a coherent policy .
I consider that this addition is only the decent minimum .
What in fact does it mean politically ?
Might it possibly be nothing but words ?
In this sense the Stockholm Summit was a disappointment .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Needless to say , we want more , but sound results have been achieved .
Despite this , I would like to underline a number of the warnings which Mr Prodi flagged .
The summit is increasingly running the risk of degenerating into a media spectacle .
I should like to ask the President of the Council the following .
My second question concerns the following .
We are all grateful for the fact that Milosevic is behind bars .
This is supposedly the last summit of the year on enlargement .
Let us remove the obstacles .
There is this draft framework directive .
We are already well behind schedule : it is time to act and to restructure these sectors .
My second point is method .
We are not entirely clear about these social situations .
What do we know about how employees are defined in terms of their mobility ?
This is certainly not the Europe that we want to have .
He is a man who has made an all-out commitment to interethnic coexistence .
They have 4 ministers in key positions in this government .
We can probably do this with the help called for .
Governments in the west must realise that problems need to be monitored closely and a solution found .
If we keep stopping half way , we just give the extremists room to manoeuvre .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , you made reference to the Spanish Presidency in your introduction a moment ago .
This is a very important mandate in my view .
Secondly , demographic development , to which you yourself have already referred .
However , Mr President-in-Office , ladies and gentlemen , choices must be made in these areas too .
This brings me to my final point , Mr President-in-Office : the quality of work .
It is also a question of legislation .
Mr President , let me briefly comment on what has been said .
This means that we were well-placed to achieve success .
I will comment on the points you raised from two perspectives .
This is based on consensus , unanimity .
When we are able to put forward common principles , we must naturally also act together .
Naturally we attracted a great deal of attention in the media when we received President Putin as a guest .
Relations must be deepened and developed , and dialogue must be open .
This is what this is about .
This is far from unimportant .
Now , a few words on the Lisbon Process .
Let me comment on the discussion on deregulation and liberalisation .
This is a very large and fundamental reorganisation .
It is far from simple .
It is no easy debate .
We can never ignore this .
We constantly have to maintain this balance .
Here I am talking to those who said that we have not produced any initiatives to combat unemployment .
Without increased production , we will have no opportunities to successfully combat unemployment .
This is why we have drawn up guidelines in Stockholm .
Several speakers have mentioned enlargement of the Union .
We are currently negotiating intensively with the active participation of the Commission .
As far as I can judge , the negotiations are successful , but they are not easy .
This change must make their accession as painless and successful as possible .
These negotiations are difficult and we are in the middle of them .
Regarding openness , the presidency and Parliament are in alliance .
I hope that we succeed .
I will be happy to talk about this question again in a bilateral context .
Success , which is what we are seeking , is to the advantage of the entire European economy .
Mr President , thank you once more for your many constructive contributions and points of view .
This is a clear commitment made by Parliament and all of us .
Quite the contrary : it is possible to rectify the situation and combine globalisation and social justice .
This does not have to be the case at all .
This will be extremely important at the Gothenburg Council .
As so many speakers have said , on the economic front , Stockholm was a great disappointment .
One of the major failures of the Stockholm Summit was in the foreign affairs field .
Until 1997 , every year the European Union did so .
Now the socialists are failing , it is business as usual .
There is now no single independent media channel in Russia .
This is a scandal .
This is our great neighbour to the east .
We must deal with it on a practical and political basis , but with frankness and determination .
God help us if the socialists had run Europe during the cold war .
( Loud applause from the right )
Mr President , God help us if the conservatives ever run Europe again .
We have a commitment from the main European companies in this sector .
On post Parliament does not have a problem . The Council does .
I welcome the progress made thus far .
We shall now proceed to the votes .
I understand that corrections are needed to the Spanish version .
Is the Bureau aware of this or not ?
If it is , I would be grateful if they could be announced .
In particular , I should like the translation of Section 19 to be reviewed .
Trakatellis report ( A5-0104 / 2001 )
Therefore , it is important that we get this proposal through as quickly as possible .
I look forward to the second reading .
I saw Mrs Trakatellis as if in a dream .
Congratulations Mrs Trakatellis !
We have therefore voted against the report .
The European Parliament ' s rapporteur takes the same line as the Commission .
We support the rapporteur ' s action on this proposal , on two points .
This is not the case , however .
A valid health policy requires resources that the Commission is refusing to provide itself with .
We have therefore abstained from voting on this report , though we have voted on certain proposals .
therapeutic and diagnostic measures must not be considered to be exclusively commercial and industrial activities .
We vehemently rejected this because this is a matter for the Member States .
Stauner report ( A5-0112 / 2001 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
Why is that ?
Let us therefore verify whether this money is used to bring practical benefit to the European citizens .
Blak report ( A5-0113 / 001 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
Because I hope that the Commission will make much , much greater efforts .
But to do what ? To resolve the problems of pensioners and elderly people in Europe .
Naturally we have voted against giving any discharge to the European Commission .
Our negative votes on individual points are merely a continuation of this general lack of confidence .
According to his recommendations , a great deal needs to change yet .
There is no clear statement that the way in which the case was handled after January 1994 was illegal .
According to the rapporteur ' s own information , this applies here .
van der Laan report ( A5-0108 / 2001 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
I do not support them .
The national States have to decide to take a step backwards .
Seppänen report ( A5-0097 / 2001 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
( IT ) Mr President , the Seppänen report comments on the abolition of the ECSC .
Rühle report ( A5-0109 / 2001 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
I was Gulliver-Fatuzzo , a minuscule man , and I was surrounded by giants .
Who were these giants ?
You are the ones who need to develop , for we are already developed enough ! "
Hermange report ( A5-0084 / 2001 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
It was only a dream , Mr President !
The effort to mask the class aspects of the problem is obvious .
Conservatives in the UK have voted in favour .
We can go back over previous resolutions and reports from this house concerning people with disabilities .
However , the same basic barriers and problems still exist .
It also underlines the need to mainstream disability issues into all policies .
I strongly believe that those with disabilities will be indispensable in this sector .
This is a fundamental change in attitude which should be emphasised .
The concept of people with disabilities includes all types of disability , whether physical , mental or sensory .
This is another important fundamental change .
The lack of statistics on this subject has been apparent since 1998 .
( Intervention shortened pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure )
That concludes voting time .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.12 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
I think that the Stockholm Summit set the wrong priorities .
The liberalisation of the energy markets was blocked by my country and by France .
And all the while , Stockholm was busy setting specifications for social and education policy !
It is unacceptable .
Europe is putting the cart before the horse .
It needs to continue with its liberalisation policy so that the markets can develop in the consumers ' interest .
Europe is not culturally homogenous , nor should it become so .
Therein lies our strength because , on the contrary , Europe thrives on its diversity .
I hope that they will make use of it for the good of Europe .
So what exactly is the problem ?
Here policy must be able to intervene and pull these points back into the decision-making process of the policy .
Therefore I think the telling-off was aimed at the wrong culprit .
We need a unanimous political vote and no more beating about the bush .
Military use may be possible , but it is not a prerequisite .
Technologically-minded young people in Europe will find attractive new jobs through Galileo .
Europe ' s high tech industry will be at the top of the world league in this forward-looking sector .
The so-called market value of Galileo increases in indirect proportion to the start-up capital needed .
We must be able to insist on the European negotiating principle of burden sharing in this sector too .
We must do the job properly now !
Tomorrow will be too late !
After all , we still need seven or eight years to roll out .
Could the Commission therefore give specific examples of some of the businesses which have agreed to the funding ?
In conclusion , launching satellites is a very expensive business .
We need firm assurances that investments in the Galileo project will produce an adequate return .
Fundamental questions and less than three months to go .
I therefore urge the Commission and Council to consider these points .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow .
Area of freedom , security and justice
The next item is the joint debate on
The second issue is freedom .
Freedom is a product of justice .
Freedom is based on human dignity .
The European Parliament suggested this on my initiative three years ago .
The Commission scoreboard here is exemplary .
We can see crucial deficits on the part of the Council here .
Finally , I should like to comment on the sensitive area of asylum law .
We have a plethora of often contradictory initiatives from the individual states .
We call on the Council to make good these deficits .
It is a great honour to be able to talk to you today .
This is a very relevant area which we are discussing today .
Studies clearly show that judicial cooperation is close to the heart of European citizens .
Implementation is , as you know , now at a very intense stage .
Often there is an intimate link between issues falling under the first and third pillars .
Over and above this the Council adopted over thirty conclusions , resolutions , recommendations and reports .
Progress was made on a number of issues by the very successful French and Portuguese presidencies .
Decisions were reached in several important areas in terms of combating economic crime .
Having said this I would like to focus on the question posed by Mr Posselt .
Not only the scope but also the character of cooperation has changed .
Here we have to jointly take responsibility for the future of the EU .
The Swedish Presidency has begun discussions on the way the Council works .
Such an improvement would make the joint work of the institutions much easier .
The presidency considers that this ought to be able to be arranged in practice .
This programme of measures is ambitious and wide-ranging .
It contains a large number of measures which are to be implemented .
This concerns mutual recognition of decisions , and the freezing of assets and evidence .
This will see the beginning of work in recognising and implementing the judgments themselves .
Several of these instruments have already entered into force or are on the way to doing so .
1999 was a turning point in the field of justice and home affairs .
2000 marked the beginning of the implementation of the Tampere mandate .
Here we are faced with two problems that I see no reason to hide .
The first concerns the myriad initiatives of the Member States , the reasoning behind which sometimes escapes us .
It is not my intention to question the Member States ' right of initiative .
With regard to the specific questions raised by Mr Posselt , I shall be very brief .
None of the other conventions has , to date , been signed and ratified by all 15 Member States .
We also presented a proposal on the rights and responsibilities of third-country nationals who are long-term residents .
Let us take pride in our European identity .
You feel that we need a new modus operandi here .
In the meantime , there are now over 5 million young people taking synthetic drugs .
The European Union has become the biggest producer and exporter of synthetic drugs in the world .
And if we look at the scoreboard , then we can see that very little action has been taken .
I would ask for this to be made a new focal point .
Finally , I should like to mention one more thing .
Where there is no bearing on reality , as in the case of family reunion ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
But the citizens do not know .
In fact , the impression given by the press is that not even our government knows .
Laeken is going to be a new opportunity for the common immigration and asylum policy .
Please do not just reaffirm the Tampere decisions again .
Tell us how you intend to move forward .
Please do not repeat that things are on the right road .
Really convince yourselves that your decisions are good ones , and uphold them clearly and with determination and courage .
Parliament - and I am sure in this respect the citizens too - will follow .
We really do not have much joined-up thinking on that subject .
These are not national problems .
Regularly , in Gibraltar , at Calais and elsewhere , refugees are coming ashore at European ports .
They risk their lives to flee from dictatorships , conflict and misery .
However , they are likely to end up as illegal immigrants , and they know it .
One only has to look at France , where 94 % of applications for asylum are rejected .
Yet the right of asylum is a fundamental and inalienable right .
There is a European fund to provide support for the consequences of receiving these people here .
In order to improve efficiency , is the Council thinking of assessing the use of resources from this fund ?
At the present time , two mechanisms are being studied ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Words should now be followed by actions .
I have three remarks in connection with this question .
First of all , a comment on the semantics .
However , that is not the case .
Finally , I have a political remark to make .
A system is being developed which suspends the crucial aspects of legal security .
We must begin to find answers to these questions now , and fast !
These concerns also require European responses .
( The President cut the speaker off )
The house that we are building for our citizens should be able to withstand an earthquake .
What we will need is an assessment of the impact of measures taken .
Arguably that may be true for 24 hours ; thereafter it is a matter for all of us .
The Charter of Fundamental Rights is arguably the most important development that we have seen .
First , freedom is achieved by giving people a free choice of where they wish to live .
Which is why I call on the Council to take prevention seriously .
It is quite worrying that the presidency does not respect the opinion of Parliament .
Alarming figures are presented regarding population trends - Europe is shrinking .
Our external borders are under great pressure .
Has the Council no practical solutions in this area ?
Will crime and harsh reality decide ?
We look forward to the proposals which the Commission will present in this field .
The Commission appears to be the most suitable body to do this .
Some people describe Europe as a Europe which locks people out .
They term it ' Fortress Europe ' .
At the moment , there are different policies in different countries .
At least that is the way I clearly understood it .
The latter is based on people ' s need for protection .
They tend to be found among the 14 million unemployed .
Freedom , security , justice - but there is no such thing !
Freedom in Gibraltar , for those who drown in attempting to enter the EU ?
Is this freedom ?
Mrs Klingvall , Mr Bodström !
There is a word for this , a rude word : - ' Fortress Europe ! '
That is what you are building , precisely what you promised you would not build !
Just last Sunday , 447 Kurdish refugees landed in Greece .
Their Odyssey to Europe had lasted ten days under inhumane conditions .
Three women gave birth to children in these conditions .
The refugees sell all their worldly possessions in order to buy a passage to Europe .
It is intolerable .
Europe ' s borders must be open to people in need , fleeing their homeland .
Why does anyone leave their homeland ?
Where are the refugees who willingly leave their homeland ?
I think we should fight the reasons why they flee .
Europe does not just need an economic face , it also needs a human face .
We need to be more courageous in protecting the rights of the citizens .
Why do we not all focus on this programme ?
For this we need a clear political will and sufficient budgetary funding .
Mr President , jag vill prata franska [ I should now like to speak in French ] .
Everything was for the best in the best of all worlds .
The bishops fill the desperately empty churches with illegal immigrants .
Since then , more than 200 of them have disappeared .
But why has this happened ?
What a psychological shock , what a cause for concern to the self-righteous .
But others will follow , millions of others , who will arrive on foot and by train .
I will attempt to summarise and comment on your viewpoints and questions .
None of us is interested in building a " Fortress Europe " .
One of the foremost aims of the Swedish Presidency is enlargement .
This work obviously has considerable dynamism .
This is a continuing and despicable trade .
It exploits people in vulnerable situations .
It is something that we must work against with considerable strength .
However , we must do so in a number of different ways - one way is not sufficient .
We must deal with the underlying causes of involuntary migration .
We met representatives of five of the Baltic states in order to discuss precisely these matters .
The first of these is the issue of human trafficking .
Humanitarian acts must not be punishable .
We are working on a humanitarian clause concerning illegal entry .
As far as the penalties are concerned : these must be severe .
However , the sanctions must not be disproportionately severe .
They wondered : " What is actually happening ?
You have this vision and the aim from Tampere , but what are you actually doing ? "
I reported on some of the decisions taken .
I also reported on the status of the work in respect of some of the directives that are relevant .
The negotiating work on these directives is currently progressing well .
It is thus our hope that we will be able to make decisions in May .
We have also come a long way in respect of launching the Eurodac system .
The test runs will be started in late summer 2001 .
However , we look forward to being able to commence work on this directive as well .
Mr President , criminality is becoming increasingly international .
This is true both at national and at international level .
It applies to people who are sought by the authorities .
Mr Gahrton said that the international SIS system charts people ' s sexual orientation .
This is incorrect !
There is no such or similar sensitive information in the system .
The only people who are served by having no international cooperation are the criminals .
It is in everyone ' s interest for the cooperation to work and be effective .
Everyone stands to gain , including from the domestic point of view , if it works as it should .
If this does not work it will create a negative impression .
There has been a very important Swedish initiative on synthetic drugs .
So we are not neglecting the drugs issue .
Let us all work together to that end .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Wednesday 16 May .
UN conference on least-developed countries
The next item is the following two oral questions :
I also hope to make a contribution to this with the proposal for a resolution that I am tabling .
We are all - I hope - aware of the tragic situation these countries are experiencing .
The Regulation became applicable on 5 March this year .
The Regulation is therefore of crucial economic significance for the least developed countries .
Preparations for this conference are underway .
I am thinking , in particular , of all aspects of health and plant health .
This being the case , let us not hide behind speeches that are too politically correct .
We must also be clear .
From this point of view it is important that the role of each party should be clear .
This action programme will serve as an itinerary .
Good governance is a key issue in the LDCs .
This is absolutely wrong .
The aid budget must concentrate on the poorest .
That is what our citizens expect and require .
Using the aid budget as some sort of underhand immigration policy is wrong .
Have an anti-immigration policy , by all means , but be honest about it .
We must not rob the poorest countries to achieve our own political ends .
Finally , we must do everything we can to prevent conflict .
Conflict prevention is a key to helping the LDCs grow .
Their average life expectancy is 50 years .
Too many LDCs have totally unsustainable debt burdens .
Everything but arms represents significant progress .
I think I see him smile , and this might present us with some difficulties .
This is absolutely unacceptable .
The poorest countries only benefit from concrete and binding agreements .
Trade concessions on their own are not sufficient .
The rich countries must ease their burden of debt by a substantial amount .
It is of the utmost importance that we should pursue a separate discharge policy for each developing country individually .
Debt relief has no meaning if debts keep mounting up .
If political and economic power are not distinctly separated , only corruption can reign supreme .
It is hopeless to fight poverty if countries remain trapped in violent conflict .
Our fellow MEPs have illustrated this amply .
How coherent is our own policy ?
I wonder about that , for I note that we remain caught up in our own incoherence .
Must we really continue to support our own sugar production ?
Surely there is no reason for doing that !
We discovered these facts just now .
In Europe , only the northern countries are meeting this commitment .
There is no need to seek further afield for the reasons for the results that have been obtained .
The LDCs are still , in many cases , exporters of only one or two basic products .
Production capacity has been reduced in some countries .
I believe that development cannot be summed up simply as the organisation of trading relations ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
There are enough tasks to get to grips with .
It is simply scandalous and something we cannot live with here in the European Union .
It is amazing that often the countries richest in raw materials have the poorest population .
Take the example of Angola .
It is obvious that this system has been implemented on purpose .
Let us hope that the rest of the industrialised world will follow our lead .
95 % of people suffering from AIDS live in developing countries .
Also , diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis claim too many victims annually .
Healthcare in the poorest countries is seriously underfunded .
It appears that the least developed countries are spending as little as USD 8 per person on healthcare .
According to the WHO , this figure should be 8 or 9 times higher .
I would like to list a few of these initiatives .
Thirdly , aid for basic healthcare should be doubled in the 2001 Community budget .
Half of that amount should be earmarked for the least developed countries .
Europe should also free up extra monies for this fund .
We need tangible results .
I am convinced that the EU and Mr Lamy are extremely well placed to achieve these .
The Swedish Presidency has made conflict prevention one of its core issues .
Mr President , I would like to make three comments in response to the debate .
The first has to do with the issue the President-in-Office of the Council has just addressed .
I think we ourselves do not always come out unscathed .
What would you have said had we failed in our attempt ?
These concrete decisions have been taken and are now going to be implemented .
Mrs Kinnock wanted to know which LDC countries in particular are likely to export arms .
The list has not been finalised .
I think that the conference on the LDCs will enable us to exert a bit of pressure .
Chile and New Zealand have displayed positive tendencies .
Such an impression is totally without foundation .
My third and final comment has to do with access to medicines .
This point was brought up by Mr Miranda , Mrs Boudjenah and Mr van den Berg .
This general plan is now on the table .
You are aware of it . It is available for you to read .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken tomorrow .
Question Time ( Council )
The next item is Question Time to the Council ( B5-0163 / 2001 ) .
As they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
Question No 1 by ( H-0248 / 01 )
Question No 2 by ( H-0259 / 01 )
Does the Council agree that the above peace plan constitutes a sufficient basis for talks ?
Question No 3 by ( H-0306 / 01 )
At this time the Commission announced that it would double its financial support in the Presevo Valley .
This support now amounts to nearly EUR 2 million .
The Council reacted quickly and clearly to the serious incidents in FYROM that took place recently .
I am here on behalf of Mr Papayannakis .
But to get back to the point of my question .
I do not know whether this was a hymn of praise to Mr Solana .
What is being done about applying Security Council Resolution 1244 ?
And Mr Solana did the same .
Is this what they mean by their determination to guard the borders ?
Tell us once and for all , is Kosovo a Serbian province or an independent state ?
( The President cut the speaker off )
I realise that Mr Korakas is not satisfied with my answer .
Who is it that must ensure that the UN Security Council ' s resolutions are observed ?
There is also talk of leaving unmanned American aeroplanes on Bulgarian territory .
All this indicates the risk of a crisis spreading in Bulgaria .
The honourable Member is clinging onto speculation regarding which the Council cannot comment further .
As they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
Question No 4 by ( H-0290 / 01 ) :
Question no 5 by ( H-0299 / 01 ) :
The Union strongly recommends that the International Criminal Court be set up in the near future .
In addition , we are offering technical expertise .
You spoke of a long process , but three years is an awfully long time !
It is expected that the second and third readings will be able to take place before the summer recess .
Greece reports that it needs to amend its penal law .
It is expected that these changes will take a few months more .
They have not yet ventured to give an exact date for ratification .
I wanted to ask the President-in-Office about Greece .
However , he has replied , so perhaps there is no point .
He should show some respect and not use such figures of speech .
Question No 6 by ( H-0251 / 01 ) :
The fact that the rights have been formulated in the Charter thus does not affect their value .
The Council has a duty to follow , discuss and monitor the question of the status of the Charter .
These are not designed in such a way as to be legally deployable immediately .
Allow me to mention two things .
Firstly : you stated that the Charter has not been adopted .
The answer is that it has been solemnly proclaimed .
The Member requests repetition .
I don ' t like repeating myself , but I am at Parliament ' s service .
Question No 7 by ( H-0252 / 01 ) :
I understand the technicalities and thank the Minister for that .
The Council has not had opportunity to discuss this matter .
Mr President , I often receive queries from citizens wishing to carry weapons in Europe .
These people are hunters and marksmen travelling to competitions .
There are huge discrepancies in the rules here .
Do you intend to take any initiatives here ?
No , we do not .
The Framework Agreement is now subject to ratification by the signatory states .
Question No 8 by ( H-0253 / 01 ) :
The question that the honourable Member raises has never been put before the Council .
This is also in itself an answer to the follow-on question put by the previous Member .
I do not know whether to laugh or cry .
I am really starting to question the Council ' s validity .
The discharge , as granted by the Council , was an illustration of bad craftsmanship pure and simple .
I cannot understand why you are simply fobbing us off with such a response .
Indeed , Article 296 of the Treaty on European Union imposes a few restrictions on yourselves in this respect .
I actually have nothing to add beyond what I stated in my initial answer .
It is the Council ' s task to pursue the Treaty . That is what we do .
Question No 9 by ( H-0257 / 01 ) :
On 12 March the Council adopted the guidelines for the 2002 budget .
Question No 10 by ( H-0264 / 01 ) :
' 1 .
I have two supplementary questions for the Council of Ministers .
Does the Council of Ministers share this view ?
What was the result of this type of transaction tax ?
Question No 11 by ( H-0265 / 01 ) :
I have an excellent knowledge of this protocol and do not need this summing up .
The question revolves around a very central issue .
Am I to understand the answer as saying that the Council is unaware of these negotiations ?
I have little to add to my original answer .
I have tried to explain the legal reasons for the Council ' s action .
Question No 12 by ( H-0271 / 01 ) :
How is it possible that the Council did not know ?
Question No 13 by ( H-0273 / 01 ) :
The EU will also follow up the issue of a more vigorous dialogue on human rights .
The EU and the GCC are at present negotiating a free-trade agreement .
The answer to the honourable Member ' s question is , in principle , yes .
Such organisations mainly exist within the framework of the United Nations .
Question No 14 by ( H-0278 / 01 ) :
The Council therefore lacks competence when it comes to what is known as medically-assisted suicides .
I want to thank Mr Danielsson for that answer .
History has shown the danger of such a development .
This is obviously an important issue that Mr Sacrédeus is addressing , and one affecting our values .
Question No 15 by ( H-0280 / 01 ) :
The Council would call attention to the fact that the Northern stock is a biological concept .
I should like to ask you what reason there was to justify this discrimination against the Bay of Biscay .
All assessments of quotas are based on scientific and biological advice .
Data from research vessels is constantly being assembled .
Reports from professional fishermen also have an important role to play in assessments .
It is therefore basic biological facts that form the basis of the proposed measures .
Question No 16 by ( H-0286 / 01 ) :
Out of the 645 candidates entered on the reserve lists , not a single one is disabled .
But what is the Council if it is not the Member States ?
I am not certain that is really a satisfactory answer .
He also said that it does not come into operation until 2003 .
The Commission must have some relationship with the Council , and I would hope for a more satisfactory response .
The formal response must be the one I have just given .
Question No 17 by ( H-0288 / 01 ) :
It is important to redress the imbalances of the past .
Question No 19 by ( H-0294 / 01 ) :
What is the Council 's response to these conclusions ?
Practical measures are being taken within the Community too .
Mr President , I want to thank the President-in-Office for his reply mentioned the Kyoto Protocol .
What does the decision mean for the world community ?
That brings us to the end of Question Time to the Council .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.17 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
Air carrier liability in the event of accidents
These limits are now far too low .
This formed the inspiration for the original ( EC ) Regulation No 2027 / 97 .
I would like to highlight six points this evening .
You will understand that I do not share their views .
Secondly , the Member States have agreed that the Community itself is signatory to the Montreal Convention .
At the same time , I very much tried to retain the right of passengers to information .
The Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism adopted the amendments by general vote .
These amendments can roughly be divided into three categories .
That is new .
In that way , airline companies will be able to offer this information in a uniform manner .
The text clearly outlines the provisions of the regulation and is devoid of any legal jargon .
The lawyers in the court room will love this .
Finally , I would like to recommend all eighteen amendments .
I would ask you please to be disciplined this evening .
Nonetheless , it was a most interesting speech .
In my remarks I would like to commend the report to the House .
I believe that it will result in an increase in protection for air passengers .
This position is complicated by two factors .
Nor is this likely to be the situation for some years to come .
Secondly , as referred to by the rapporteur , there is the issue of extra-territoriality .
Unfortunately some clauses still contained in the regulation would result in just such a scenario .
I commend the report to the House in its entirety .
The Regulation was therefore held to be valid .
The Warsaw Convention is 70 years of age .
Those rights are negligible .
That is what we should be doing tonight .
Mr President , allow me first of all to thank the rapporteur for an excellent piece of work .
It is naturally important to take account of the interests of air passengers in this issue .
I therefore think that the final outcome of the report is entirely positive .
When the revised Regulation comes into force , European air passengers will be given significantly better protection .
Mr President , I intervene to support the report by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte .
We enjoyed a highly fruitful collaboration within our parliamentary committee .
We are debating the liability in this respect and the provision of information to the consumer .
We are now in a situation where we are covered by insurance in Europe .
Mr President , Commissioner , various modes of transport cross many national borders .
This should not lead to the constant changing of requirements and conditions .
This means that the rapporteur ' s approach appeals to me a great deal .
This is a good thing .
This basic truth is something the consumer organisations do not always bear in mind in all their enthusiasm .
It will be absolutely essential to avoid excessive bureaucracy in this .
In its proposal , the Commission requires the companies to provide passengers with detailed information .
Therefore , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 13 and 18 .
That is why we cannot accept Amendments Nos 9 and 10 .
The Commission can , however , accept all the other amendments , which strengthen or clarify the text .
Thank you , Commissioner De Palacio .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Coordination of transport by rail , road and inland waterway
This is its intention and we applaud it .
We believe , however , that the Commission has displayed a certain degree of prudence in its proposal .
It has moved ahead , but rather too tentatively .
We would like there to be a reasonable degree of identification between Parliament and the Commission .
Something similar could be said for transport by inland waterway .
Trains can use a greater proportion of renewable energy .
If action is not taken in time , road traffic will double between now and 2010 .
Does all this mean that we have to gradually give up using roads ?
Not at all .
To end with , what can be said about external costs ?
That is why the Member States must be able to offer compensation to the competing modes of transport .
In its recommendation , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has made a strong case for honest competition .
Additionally , the description of the term " common interest " deserves attention .
Competitive neutrality can therefore be jeopardised .
This adds the necessary predictability in the assessment of support schemes by the Commission .
And that is precisely the objective here .
This poses a problem , because it is not clear exactly what external costs are .
How can they be scientifically defined ?
And how can they be apportioned ? " , we still have our work cut out .
I am delighted that the report says as much .
The previous speaker pointed this out .
There must be special grounds for exceptions to this rule .
In this regulation , the special grounds are : the coordination of inland transport .
This is the only way we shall ever bring about the much-vaunted intermodal transport chains .
This should apply irrespective of the legal form of the infrastructure operator .
Now to aid for use of the infrastructure .
In other words , both the infrastructure and the external costs must be included when calculating aid .
This is introduced in proposed Amendment No 48 and I call on the House to support it .
We are also in favour of a de minimis rule of EUR 100 000 over three years .
Mr President , Madam Vice-President , I too should like to thank the rapporteur for his report .
The numerous proposed amendments are proof of the interest which this report has generated .
But this will not happen if there is false competition between the various modes of transport .
In our opinion , this exemption from the ban of government aid is undesirable .
We will therefore be voting against Recital No 14 and Article 4 . They do not belong here .
Regretfully , we must also point out what this regulation cannot achieve .
Mr Camisón Asensio himself has addressed this .
And if we do more , then we should do it consistently .
Whether this is in keeping with the spirit of the Camisón Asensio report I somehow doubt .
The forthcoming discussion on this new proposal will give us an opportunity to clarify this question .
Roughly half of the amendments agree with the Commission ' s position and can therefore be accepted .
Some of them , however , run in a very different direction and hence we cannot accept them .
I shall refer to some of them .
Neither Amendment Nos 21 or 37 can change this fundamental principle of Community law .
We therefore cannot accept that they should not be communicated .
My compliments to the interpreters on keeping up with the speaker !
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Sea ports , inland ports and intermodal terminals
Then the Council took its time .
Nonetheless , I think the end is in sight .
We said both in Committee and in Parliament : let us set our sights a little lower !
These errors should not be repeated during the revision .
Rapporteurs simply need to have the courage to stand their ground .
He has demonstrated that courage and has been successful as a result .
I should like to thank the Vice-President and her officials for helping us to negotiate that compromise .
So , in this respect , my warmest thanks to the Commission .
I , too , shall endeavour to be brief on this lovely evening , hence just three points .
I think that the classification which we have found together with the Council is a very good one .
Secondly , we had to draw a dividing line between infrastructure and superstructure .
First , it was important to clarify what we mean by infrastructure .
This gave rise to a whole series of difficulties between the Member States and the Commission .
I think this was achieved very well .
What is Parliament here for ?
for Community ports : 500 000 tonnes or 100-200 000 passengers per year and
for inland ports : 500 000 tonnes of freight .
If , in addition , these regions are remote , this importance becomes strategic .
I close by congratulating the rapporteur on his work .
Mr President , a very good evening to you .
First may I thank my honourable fellow member , Willy Piecyk , for his convincing work .
He has worked for our ports and for that he deserves our thanks .
I said all ' s well that ends well .
I think it is also important to see small ports in an international context .
That is now being put right .
It is a pity it has taken so long .
I hope that is the message we can endorse here tonight .
It will be a welcome boost for ports across the European Union .
We will all benefit from this decision but we must look to the future .
I conclude by again thanking the rapporteur .
In a situation such as the one before us , we can look ahead or back .
I have heard a few people make some very valid comments already .
We are talking about networks , water networks , and intermodal networks .
I am therefore keen to find out what our next step will be .
Many thanks once again to the rapporteur . Congratulations !
And many thanks to all of you for your contributions , which were wholly constructive .
Thank you , Commissioner De Palacio .
You have been here for ages .
Now you are free to go and do whatever you please .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
We have an important item on our agenda today .
We therefore thank the Commission for initiating this legislative procedure .
We then concluded our first reading at the Council ' s request and negotiations continued .
What are the core problems ?
The core problem is not the question of banning money laundering . That was decided long ago .
It is the reporting obligations which are at issue here .
One last point on the question of equal treatment .
This sort of arrangement would not work and corrections are therefore needed in this area .
The European Parliament will endeavour to adopt this directive quickly .
We also know that , in the meantime , organised crime has earned billions of euros in various sectors .
Organised crime does all this by using the instruments of money laundering .
New methods have been introduced , because the old ones do not work any more .
New professions are being used , or rather abused and involved in all cases .
It includes all professions which use services such as banks .
In other words , it is a practicable proposal .
The proposal developed by Mr Lehne and the Committee is a good proposal .
It is a simpler and more manageable proposal .
This both protects the confidential relationship and meets the demands of the fight against crime .
The Council has rejected fundamental proposals .
We shall have a conciliation procedure .
As Council representatives are here , I say to you : dress warmly for this conciliation .
Mr President , I am afraid I am going to break the consensus so far .
However , freedom of capital movements must not be exploited for undesirable purposes .
Criminal money could give liberalisation a bad name .
Turning to lawyers , they rightly get special treatment .
The lobbying of lawyers ' organisations against this common position has been somewhat exaggerated .
National sovereignty has to be suspended in this connection .
The advent of the euro is also an absolute godsend for crime .
Money laundering becomes so much simpler because there is no longer any need to change the money into dollars .
It will soon all be possible in euros .
Europe is only at the start of the process .
It is virgin territory waiting to be explored .
Organised crime is a multi-headed monster whose financial heart and lungs need to be ripped out .
The new proposal is not as bad as the previous one , but it is still not good enough .
And yet , they are all opposed to the Council ' s proposal and welcome Parliament ' s proposal .
I fully support this extension .
The reference to ascertaining the seriousness of the offence is , indeed , not very clear .
Thirdly : the confidentiality of information received .
Therefore , stringent confidentiality rules on information on suspect operations need to be issued .
Mr President , this is a very important report and it approaches a difficult subject .
She is a lawyer or barrister by profession and perhaps she should have declared an interest .
Those clients may be involved in all sorts of dodgy transactions .
They should be covered .
I would like to tackle money lending as well , but that is another issue .
Money laundering is linked to organised crime .
We know that .
It is linked to drug smuggling , terrorism and forgery of bank notes .
I agree with Mrs Sörensen .
There are loopholes in this system .
We must do everything we can to counter them .
It seems to me that the fundamental human rights mentioned are protected .
They will not come into play when this proposal becomes reality .
The international community is looking to the European Union to find solutions to those difficult questions .
I would now like to turn to the individual amendments in the draft second reading recommendation .
The decision was made to move gradually to the coverage of all serious crime .
Having agreed on this wide coverage , the Commission cannot accept these amendments .
The Commission is regrettably unable to accept the amendments as worded .
In its view , the legal profession constitutes a special case and requires special treatment .
Of course , the Commission concedes that drawing this line may not always be easy .
Nevertheless it also insists on this point .
I would like Members to keep that in mind .
Amendments Nos 7 and 11 relate to the role of the competent authorities .
The Commission does not believe that such an inclusion would be appropriate .
Amendments Nos 15 and 16 deal with client identification .
I cannot .
The Commission therefore believes that the common position in this regard provides the necessary scope for flexibility .
Therefore the amendment , as it has now been put forward , is regrettably unacceptable .
Amendments Nos 19 and 20 deal with identification requirements for casino customers .
The Commission considers that these amendments do not improve the common position .
The Commission could not accept this breach .
Finally , Amendments Nos 26 and 27 refer to OLAF .
The Commission is currently preparing this proposal .
The Commission considers , therefore , these amendments unnecessary .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Community programmes / Judicial network
Mr President , I shall do my best .
OISIN is a programme of cooperation between law enforcement authorities with a budget of EUR 8 million .
The Commission has proposed extending the GROTIUS , OISIN and STOP multi-annual programmes by a further two years .
The Commission ' s implementation reports confirm that the programme objectives have been achieved .
I would have liked a single framework programme to have been submitted now .
There are reasons against continuing various funding programmes separately from one another .
It is also difficult for Parliament to keep track of the programmes .
In addition , a separate budget has been proposed for pilot projects .
So much for this aspect .
Now to the European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters .
It was decided to set up a judicial network in criminal matters back in 1998 .
This network operates via national contact points which advise and support local authorities .
A detailed proposal on this has already been submitted .
In this respect , it is the right time to be talking about the GROTIUS programme .
At the end of the day , however , too little use is made of these instruments .
However , I must also point out that the requirements of legal practice are very varied .
Allow me to illustrate this with a very specific example .
There is therefore a heavy responsibility on us to provide access to justice when things go wrong .
I hope it will not disappoint .
It is a proposal on two levels .
I should also like to hear Commissioner Vitorino ' s opinion on this matter .
International organised crime is more successful , more powerful and more dangerous than ever .
This will be the golden era for international crime .
Today ' s international crime syndicates are global business corporations .
The European Union , Europe , will become one huge Disneyland for organised crime .
It is , therefore , crucial that a European judicial network is set up promptly .
Not only for criminal affairs , but just as much for civil and trade affairs .
We should , in this respect , perhaps follow the lead given by organised crime .
Our Group supports both reports submitted by Mrs Keßler .
The de facto situation is that these programmes came to an end in 2000 .
It is imperative that they be renewed as quickly as possible .
As regards Amendment No 4 , the Commission has its doubts .
We will do everything within our power to ensure that this collaboration is put into practice .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Vitorino .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Support system for producers of arable crops
Then , from 2002 , this measure could be opened up to the conventional sector .
I want to emphasise this at this point .
We will need far more of them than we are at present producing .
The introduction of soya may pay off .
At least 300 000 tons of additional imports a month must be added to that .
I will come back to this in tomorrow ' s debate .
Tomorrow morning we will have the opportunity to discuss this aspect .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
Mr Chairman , you have the floor .
Mr President , I wanted to refer to Rule 122 .
I wanted to say that as a personal remark .
Many thanks , Mr President , for giving me the opportunity .
But what you said was interesting Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
( The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m. )
Address by Mr Rau , President of the Federal Republic of Germany
In 271 days , the citizens of twelve European countries will have a single currency in their wallets .
We can travel freely through Europe , from Nordkap to Gibraltar .
But do we perceive ourselves as Europeans ?
We have all seen quite specific examples of our common interests in Europe .
But it is much more than a merely functional community .
The successes of the common market should encourage us to set ourselves new objectives .
Many of our citizens rightly ask who is driving the European unification train ?
What speed limit must it keep to ?
What traffic regulations apply to it ?
How and where are the points set ?
What coaches are being coupled to or removed from it ?
And where does the journey end ?
These are not academic questions .
But that should not prevent us from strengthening the principles of democracy at European level .
That is precisely what Europe is doing .
And this will , and should not , change in the future .
What must we do so that decisions taken by the European Union are more broadly justified at European level ?
At the end of the day , what should the organisational framework look like ?
And I am firmly convinced that the only answer is : we need a European constitution .
( Applause )
But surely this is just a semantic argument ?
We need to discuss the content instead of wrangling over definitions .
( Applause )
A European constitution must be the outcome of a broad debate in every country .
Sceptical and critical voices will be raised in the debate .
A federation meets all these requirements .
What is the function of a constitution in a political community ?
Finally , a constitution regulates who is responsible for what .
The principles of a constitution for a European federation of nation states are the same .
It should consist of three sections .
The first section should contain the Charter of Fundamental Rights proclaimed at the Nice Summit .
( Applause )
In so doing , an effort should be made to give the principle of subsidiarity a broader base .
That must be the guideline .
In other words , everything not specifically allocated to Europe should remain the responsibility of the nation states .
I should just like to mention two examples here .
( Applause )
( Applause )
Parliament and the Council of Ministers should - in my view - be developed into a proper two-chamber parliament .
( Loud applause )
This chamber would safeguard the sovereignty of the nation states .
The European Parliament - you , honourable Members - should become the citizens ' chamber .
Both chambers should have equal decision-making powers in all legislative areas .
( Loud applause )
A great deal of criticism about Europe sticks to the Commission , and often rightly so .
( Laughter , applause )
( Loud applause )
I prefer the parliamentary model , whereby the Commission can count on a parliamentary majority .
( Loud applause )
( Applause )
There are already issues which concern people all over Europe .
Just think of the euro , its internal stability and its external value .
( Applause )
( Applause )
Debates over recent months have shown that the intergovernmental method has reached the end of its useful life .
( Loud applause )
And we are still only a Europe of the Fifteen !
( Applause )
( Applause )
I think it was exemplary .
( Applause )
This is where the decisions needed should be prepared as comprehensively as possible .
We must involve all interested citizens .
( Applause )
The future European constitution will also be their future order .
Ladies and gentlemen , exercise your rights as freely elected members of Parliament .
Make use of the opportunity which you have to take Europe forward .
You have more influence than many would have you believe .
Help to make Europe real for the citizens of our countries .
You have already done so much .
Keep up the good work .
I am with you all the way !
( Long , loud standing ovation )
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
( The Minutes were approved )
Animal feedingstuffs / Vegetable proteins
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
Commission statement on incentives for vegetable protein production .
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has the floor .
That was only to be expected from the Council .
This continued in the Council when the associations were unsuccessful in Parliament .
The Council and , as has already been said , the Commission reacted to this .
Now we have a situation where we have a disguised half-open declaration .
Interestingly , the then Federal Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany worked on this .
And that was the very Minister who had been in favour of the half-open declaration .
A real lesson in political culture .
This is now our task .
We , in this Parliament , will implement the open declaration .
We are on the right track .
We want the open declaration with no ifs or buts and we also want the positive list .
You see , we are prepared to make compromises here too .
I would like to clarify the issue of so-called protein deficits .
What were these findings ?
The remaining 2 million tonnes or so were used as pig swill and poultry feed .
As you know , until then they had only been banned for ruminants .
Secondly , the proportion of cereals in animal feed should increase .
Thirdly , the remaining gaps will be filled by additional imports of soya meal .
What options have we examined to close these expected gaps ?
The budget costs for this option would amount to some EUR 475 million a year .
Thirdly , we have assessed the consequences the planting of protein-rich crops would have on set-aside land .
I am convinced that Parliament will take this line .
Back , however , to the first issue .
How different positions have been put forward at different times here in Parliament has also been an eye-opener .
From the outset , Parliament has followed a clear line for more transparency .
That may have brought about more movement in the direction we now want to go in .
He also repeated the demand for a legally binding positive list of permissible feed materials for feedingstuffs .
The Commission has been requested to put forward a legislative proposal by the end of 2001 .
This too has our full support .
Just like people , animals need balanced nutrition .
We have inherited a chain with many links and with large gaps between each link and the next .
That also applies to feedingstuffs .
Farmers therefore need significantly more transparency and significantly more precise information .
It is worth pointing out the close links between cereals and protein crops .
We feel that these crop productions must be guaranteed to protect the farmers and oilseed producers .
Today , the Commission has told us that this is not so .
We have turned them into cannibals .
The Council wants to leave the labelling to the feedingstuffs industry .
Meanwhile , he suggests that farmers , upon request , are entitled to comprehensive information from the industry .
In that translation , the liability for the food process is emphatically placed with the farmer .
Alternatives for animal protein include soybean and other oilseed crops rich in protein .
Other alternatives are being described as too expensive and leading to distortion .
The BSE crisis poses new dilemmas .
All the more reason for abandoning these WTO rules .
So what does the Commission propose in the face of this ?
Well , I can see at least three reasons for rejecting such a spirit of resignation and surrender .
The first is that it puts food safety at risk .
It is vital to strive for self-sufficiency in such an important product .
The third is the need to respond to consumer demand for more traceability and visibility .
Opinion is divided only on the question of which measures to take .
The starting point is the ban on meat and bone meal in feedingstuffs .
This ban is necessary as we have a crisis of confidence on our hands .
The ban on meat and bone meal in feedingstuffs is a measure which will restore consumer confidence .
We must find a model which enables European farmers to react to these new requirements .
I also feel this complex problem is connected with the WTO .
Thank you , Mrs Schierhuber .
From the point of view of producers , Parliament ' s objective is to be supported .
Safety will only be guaranteed if the acts are complied with .
My view is that the common position by the Commission is excellent .
It is usually fraud .
It was the illegal use of an oil in a mixture .
But the legislation is present .
The US has strict measures and regulations on imports .
This is clearly not satisfactory .
I am satisfied that this objective is met in the Council 's common position .
This is inappropriate in the context of the labelling directive .
I do not expect this to be possible within the timetable mentioned in the amendment .
Unfortunately our resources and other priorities do not allow the Commission to set a more ambitious timetable .
Thank you , Commissioner .
Your clarification will be noted in the Minutes .
Do you wish to speak again , Mr Fischler ?
These are two separate issues .
It is not possible to make up for this deficit , at least using currently available options .
We cannot compensate for this on the basis of a policy of subsidies .
This is simply not possible , unless we offer appropriate compensation .
This brings me back to the current protein deficit .
The Commission is criticised for looking at things purely from an economic angle .
There is no way round this issue , as we also have a responsibility to the taxpayer .
. ( DE ) Mr President , I could refer to Article 122 but I would rather save time .
Mr Byrne , thank you for your comment and your answer .
Once again let me make myself clear .
My view is that not enough preparation was made .
Am I right in thinking that it would ?
Our supply reduction measure is set aside . So it has nothing to do with the Blair House agreement .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 12 noon .
Deadlock in negotiations on the EU / Morocco Fisheries Agreement
Mr Fischler has the floor .
On that basis , on 26 March , I met Minister Chbaatou in Brussels .
Unfortunately , however , this meeting too was a total failure .
This offer was very advantageous to Morocco for a number of reasons .
That alone means a price advantage of 15 % for Morocco .
This also gives a price advantage for Morocco .
Thirdly , we did not take the landing obligations in Morocco into account in our calculation .
That is the message I will be taking to the Fisheries Council on 25 April .
We have made all our preparations in line with the conclusions of the Nice Summit .
In my view , we must act in three key areas .
To this end we will exploit all the room for negotiation at the disposal of the Commission .
We all knew that it was difficult for you .
It was little more than that , however .
Morocco is within its rights but , having got to this point , should we carry on ?
Who in Morocco is really going to benefit from the lack of an agreement ?
These are the key points .
The situation is of course difficult , serious , and unprecedented .
It is not impossible to solve , however .
And we need to ask the European Union to make a special effort .
I ask you , Mr Fischler , for your commitment and understanding .
Fishing in the European Union asks for it now more than ever .
Now , however , we have to adopt a realistic , constructive and responsible attitude .
It has the support of Parliament , which will actively defend the sector .
This is not the case for you , Mr Fischler .
Why did the negotiations fail ?
We think , however , that the framework for negotiation was the association agreement with Morocco .
In your speech you talked again about another mandate .
Is another mandate possible ?
Do you think that we would change anything with another mandate ?
The reason was obvious : between partners facilities need to be established in both directions .
Morocco ' s reasons cannot be found in preservation of resources .
Due to a lack of time , I am not going to give examples .
I understand the complexity of the problem and I am shocked at the intransigence of Morocco ' s position .
Can this be because the agreement directly served the interests of only two countries ?
These are questions that require answers .
Lastly , Morocco ' s refusal is a mystery to me .
Is it possible to find out the real reasons for this refusal ?
We are not market traders ; we are politicians .
I personally shall not .
This question remains to be answered .
It turns out that such an agreement is not possible .
The report says that there is no information on the status of these stocks .
There was also the lack of guarantee for the protection of small-scale coastal fisheries .
We have to be realistic and realise that we must solve the problem from within .
We will drive up the cost for all these other agreements to an extent that would simply be irresponsible .
Naturally , the Moroccan side is at liberty to send us an improved proposal .
I told the Minister as much .
Given the current circumstances , I do not believe it makes any sense .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Fischler .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 12 noon .
Expenditure on CFP control , inspection and surveillance systems
This is the aim of Amendment No 1 of the draft report .
I had the opportunity to convince myself of that just a short time ago .
We need to make progress and adapt ourselves to modern developments .
We need a global approach .
Responsibility for the carrying out of controls is clearly regulated .
It lies with the Member States .
So an appropriate budget is of paramount importance .
Your report shows that , by and large , we are in agreement .
Amendment No 3 seeks to add an additional recital , Recital 12 , on the budgetary mechanism .
And we can only take a decision afterwards .
But in future years we will be able to take our decision by 30 June .
Mr President , on a point of order .
I will certainly pass your request to the security service , Mr Kirkhope .
I think the Quaestors should probably get involved too .
Mr President , I do not know whether Mr Wim van Velzen is present in the Chamber .
Mr van Velzen has criticised me twice in this House , in my absence .
Moreover , together with Mr Sánchez were all the representatives of the Cuban opposition .
Now , this is a fact , not empty words .
Mr President , there will be no debate .
Thank you for that felicitous proposal , Mr Poettering .
We already had a parliamentary arena here , and now we have a lion in it .
I would like to confirm that the Commission cannot accept any of the seven amendments proposed .
The current position includes the amendments accepted by the Commission at first reading .
( The President declared the common position approved as amended )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the four legislative resolutions in successive votes )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Joint motion for a resolution on the updating of certain legal aspects concerning intra-EU investment
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Before the vote on Amendment No 3
That was presented in some of the translations as ' separation ' .
It simply means that authorisation is given for animals which are vaccinated to be used in the food chain .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Stockholm European Council : Economic and social aspects
Stockholm European Council : Financial markets
( Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution )
I will explain why .
I would therefore like to ask that this proposed amendment be withdrawn .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
I myself have my doubts .
Piecyk Report ( A5-0111 / 2001 )
Public funding , however , must be for public facilities and public services .
Lehne recommendation for second reading ( A5-0090 / 2001 )
For our part , we are in favour of total transparency in capital operations .
The war against money laundering can no longer be waged by an isolated government .
For it to be effective , cooperation between the Member States must be organised .
So those amendments are unacceptable .
It is incompatible with the expression of suspicion , worse still , the expression of possible suspicion .
What is more , restricting professional secrecy amounts to restricting citizens ' fundamental rights .
Lawyers are officers of the courts , not police officers .
. ( PT ) The position adopted in this report constitutes a step backwards from the previous position .
Attacking organised crime is simply one part of the issue .
We had hoped that this new version would be pushed through in first reading .
This is just not the case .
Such a demand would mean that bank night safe-deposit boxes would have to be set up immediately .
That , however , has absolutely nothing to do with the laundering of money from criminal activity .
Their view is that the government should not interfere in their profits and possessions .
Attempts are once again being made , rightly so , to get a tighter grip on money-laundering practices .
In this case , this may be justified .
Nonetheless , this sets an undesired precedent .
Lawyers should not be required to act against those whom they have to protect .
I will therefore give the proposal the benefit of the doubt .
Those misusing the financial system should be caught and punished .
We should not turn a blind eye to crimes of this kind .
Madam President , this issue is an important one at a European level .
Money laundering is not simply restricted to Manchester or to Madrid .
It is not enough to enforce purely British legislation , but measures must be taken across the EU .
We must work together to tackle this challenge .
Graefe zu Baringdorf Report ( A5-0079 / 2001 )
Mr President , I voted for the report presented so well by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf .
' Why is that ? ' you may ask , Mr President .
I listened very carefully to both Commissioner Fischler 's words and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf 's report .
We need openness , labelling and transparency .
Politically mature citizens want to decide for themselves what to eat .
It is clear that this demand cannot relate solely to the end product .
Farmers on the ground are responsible for animal protection and food safety .
I hope in future there will be more such self-imposed obligations .
I do not understand the Commission ' s position in opposing a positive list at all .
Sanders-ten Holte Report ( A5-0093 / 2001 )
A uniform Regulation on liability in air transport creates transparency .
Camisón Asensio Report ( A5-0096 / 2001 )
It does concern pensioners .
That is the connection , Mr President .
For another , we have guaranteed a situation whereby subsidies will have a diverting function .
I find this fundamentally questionable .
In principle , this cannot be positive for the future of the transport market .
Kessler Report ( A5-0094 / 2001 )
I concur with the gist of Mr Costa ' s opinion .
However , there is one element which I am struggling with .
In my opinion , this exemption from the ban of government aid is undesirable .
Secondly , it is not judicious to grant extra support for the use of infrastructure .
I will therefore be voting against recital 14 and Article 4 .
They do not belong in this Regulation .
These rights are guaranteed under Articles 5 and 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights .
Experience shows , however , that interpretation of the rights in question is variable throughout the Union .
Sometimes prosecuting authorities ignore them with apparent impunity .
I call for greater and better attention to these points .
Mutual recognition should facilitate common provision for conditional release pending trial .
This requires the most urgent attention of everyone in this Parliament .
Kessler Report ( A5-0091 / 2001 )
I wish to state briefly the reasons why I am supporting the Kessler report .
I fully support this common-sense strategy which broadens the system of cooperation between national authorities .
In light of enlargement , the applicant countries should also be allowed to participate in the contact meetings .
Jové Peres Report ( A5-0098 / 2001 )
Auroi Report ( A5-0117 / 2001 )
So what if they contain GMOs ?
It is presenting us with a ' non-plan ' for proteins .
( The President cut the speaker off pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure )
Foot-and-mouth disease ( RC B5-0303 / 2001 )
This Chamber knows that I have asked for a serious debate since the start .
We rely on exports and we must do our utmost to ensure that these regions remain inhabited .
I actually find it frivolous to make policy on a day-to-day basis at the expense of farmers .
I cannot imagine how animals that have been vaccinated can be labelled .
Mr President , consumer protection is a matter of great concern to all of us in this House .
Public opinion is doubtful , and it is right .
The answer is two-fold .
It is transported many times , the link with the original breeder is broken and traceability becomes unreliable .
That is part of the agricultural reform we are proposing for the years ahead .
Secondly , the massive slaughter seems to be motivated by economic reasons which are not always transparent .
I find this financial reasoning absurd .
Surely exports could be accompanied by a vaccination certificate ?
The market imposes its own health requirements too , with tragic consequences .
All that remains is the power of the market and its laws of bronze .
It is definitely high time we freed ourselves from that power .
It has penalised farmers and has increased people ' s lack of confidence in the safety of agricultural produce .
We need a policy that promotes the quality and safety of food in line with the precautionary principle .
This is vital to Scotland 's capacity to maintain its worldwide reputation for high-quality meat .
Commerce and centralism are the backbone of the European Union ' s current policy .
The course of affairs with regard to foot-and-mouth is the latest illustration of this failing .
Farmers are bewildered and at their wits ' end .
I find myself with some difficulty in supporting this proposal as it stands .
Stockholm European Council : Economic and social aspects ( RC B5-0237 / 2001 )
I am doing this in recognition of their hard work .
In our view , rational and well-ordered conclusions ought to consist of three parts :
The second part would give instructions for implementation to the various Councils of Ministers .
Reading the Stockholm conclusions , we can see how far away we are from that .
In other words ' prosperity ' is being jeopardised by the increase in longevity .
The working classes certainly have nothing to be happy about .
As to the future , we are promised a continuation of current policies .
I am now waiting , like many in this Chamber , for precise and relevant responses .
Yet another summit serving private interests .
In Stockholm , the fate of Macedonia would appear to have been dealt with in a few minutes .
This time financial services emerge as the great victors .
Stockholm European Council : Financial Markets ( B5-0244 / 2001 )
Stockholm European Council : Foreign affairs ( B5-0248 / 2001 )
The path has therefore already been mapped out .
Furthermore , the process of integrating the financial markets was also speeded up .
Third UN Conference ( B5-0246 / 2001 )
The EPLP has voted for the motion for a resolution on the Stockholm European Council .
However , we have reservations about paragraph 13 .
It did not manage to agree on a common European patent system .
I believe that the labour movement should react decisively to these negative guidelines from the European Council in Stockholm .
This is serious because national self-interest has won the day .
This may make application of the protocol more difficult , but it does not make it impossible .
This action plan must enable us to achieve the following set of timetabled goals :
II ) For the EU to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by the end of 2001 ;
III ) To adopt National Reduction Plans for greenhouse gases by the end of 2001 ;
Ladies and gentlemen , that concludes this morning ' s agenda .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.25 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m. )
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
UN Human Rights Commission and the People 's Republic of China
The first item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0268 / 2001 by Mr Dupuis and others , on behalf of the TDI Group ;
B5-0269 / 2001 by Mrs Frassoni and others , on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group ;
B5-0277 / 2001 by Mrs Frahm and others , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group ;
B5-0285 / 2001 by Mr McMillan-Scott , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group ;
B5-0294 / 2001 by Mr Haarder , on behalf of the ELDR Group ,
on the United Nations Human Rights Commission and the People 's Republic of China .
We all know there are growing social and political contradictions in that country .
That is what we must make clear to the Chinese leaders .
This applies not just in the field of international relations , but in terms of domestic policy as well .
The sustained violence and intimidation against Tibetan Buddhists is little short of a programme of ethnic cleansing .
Even setting aside this event , reports from China are , nevertheless , pouring in thick and fast .
They almost always concern acts of cruelty against its own citizens .
The Chinese régime ' s objective of breaking this movement will not succeed .
The persecutions must therefore be halted immediately and a dialogue entered into .
Parliament agrees about the situation in China .
The world ' s most populous country is systematically violating its citizens ' rights .
Europe cannot remain silent and watch this happen .
We had also asked for this earlier in the European Parliament .
But we did not get that far .
China is extremely generous when it comes to giving free rein to economic processes .
At the same time , the country is incredibly oppressive and dictatorial in its political policy .
This will , of course , generate impossible tensions , fundamental also in terms of human rights .
They sign international conventions , which they struggle to implement and then contravene .
Any partnership which we as Europe can enter into with China in this respect is very welcome .
That is why this resolution is so pertinent .
Broadly speaking , our position can be summarised as follows .
We are clearly concerned , however , to see more tangible results on the ground .
We will therefore support this resolution if it is put to the vote .
We will not co-sponsor it since we think that direct dialogue still has potential .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Kyoto Conference objectives
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0267 / 2001 by Mrs Roth-Behrendt , on behalf of the PSE Group ;
B5-0270 / 2001 by Mrs Hautala and others , on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group ;
B5-0278 / 2001 by Mr Wurtz and others , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group ;
B5-0287 / 2001 by Mr Moreira Da Silva and others , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group ;
B5-0291 / 2001 by Mrs Muscardini , on behalf of the UEN Group ;
B5-0295 / 2001 by Mr Davies and others , on behalf of the ELDR Group ,
on the Kyoto Conference objectives .
However , in any event , the European Union must keep to its obligations .
Mr President , it is scandalous that President Bush is boycotting the Kyoto Protocol .
Their hand in this boycott is obvious .
Bush is not only thick , he is as thick as two short planks .
The EU must respond by ratifying the Kyoto Protocol before the summer of 2002 .
More than 20 countries have already done just that .
These 55 countries combined account for 55 % of emissions .
Even without the US , the Kyoto Protocol will be legally valid .
Worldwide negotiations have taken place for nearly ten years .
The time has come for action and deeds .
Windmills are Denmark ' s second export product .
European actions should persuade the developing countries to accept the climate objectives in time .
The political pleas by Commissioner Wallström and the troika were to no avail .
The majority of MEPs refuse , on principle , to sign such a boycott .
Citizens , show your anger and boycott Bush .
Boycott Exxon , Texaco and Chevron .
However , the demise of the climate which Bush is bringing about for the whole world is unacceptable .
We need to use this argument in the transatlantic relations that we have with the United States .
Kyoto is only the beginning of the way forward .
What is President Bush afraid of ?
The longer-term consequences will be far more difficult to resolve .
It is not a question of the environment , or of employment .
The promotion and protection of economic competitiveness is inextricably linked to the protection of the environment .
And developed countries and communities have a particular responsibility .
This has been the pattern over most of the developed world .
I acknowledge the need for sustained economic competitiveness to provide the very resources required for a high-quality environment .
President Bush , there does not need to be any contradiction between these two objectives .
It is not jobs or the environment .
Please come back on board Kyoto , and be sure you do not mortgage all our children 's heritage .
Environmental pollution , climate change , is no respecter of borders .
This , Mr President , is the question we wish to put to the representatives of the Commission today .
It is dreadful and a big disappointment , but it is not exactly surprising .
I wish to make four brief points .
You cannot get any food in America unless you say your prayers .
Subsequently , we witnessed America ' s withdrawal from the Middle East peace process .
That is literally a life-threatening development .
And now , to cap it all , Kyoto .
Commissioner , we must save the Kyoto Protocol .
The survival of the planet is at stake .
That is why we must set an example .
With or without the United States , the European Union must sign the Kyoto Protocol .
Public opinion supports us in this .
We must convince the American public that its President is making an historic mistake .
The poorest populations will be most affected . And this is not necessarily the worst-case scenario .
This attitude of allegiance to the interests of multinational companies shows total contempt for both humans and nature .
All nations must assume their responsibilities .
I welcome the protests made by the European Union , other major countries and Member States .
The United States , which signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1998 , must be called to account .
It is the future of the planet and of our children that is at stake .
I do not think it is employment which acts against the environment .
Mr President , naturally the blow dealt to us by the US President has affected us deeply .
The worst thing would be if we were now to cast doubt on our own objectives in Europe .
This must not happen .
The more credible we ourselves are , the stronger our arguments will be in relation to the United States .
However , there are also massive economic and social advantages .
Mr President , President Bush ' s decision is deeply tragic .
For more than ten years , negotiations have been under way concerning measures to protect the climate .
Now that they are jumping ship , it is like throwing ten years of negotiations out of the window .
It jeopardises the whole of the international negotiation system in the environmental sphere .
President Bush states that the United States ' s economy would be damaged .
The potential for energy saving in the United States is enormous .
What has happened is deeply tragic .
I would fully support any call for the boycotting of US oil companies right throughout Europe .
It is clear that President Bush is only representing the interests of US industry .
He does not care about the planet , nor about the future for ourselves and our children .
It is completely unacceptable .
He is an absolute disgrace and I pity the American people .
However , the verbal clashes on this subject between the United States and the other industrial powers are hypocritical .
Mr Bush is just doing the dirty work for large US corporations in the oil and coal industry .
He is applying the philosophy of an economic order based on the quest for profit .
Were they able to prevent many continental rivers being turned into sewers ?
Were they able to prevent Seveso ?
As you know , we took the initiative of condemning this rejection .
Mr Prodi and Mr Persson wrote to President Bush on 14 March to voice our indignation .
The problem is very serious .
The European programme on climate change that Mrs González mentioned is now in existence .
It is under development .
We are going to make every effort to move the Protocol forward .
We will ratify it and we will ensure that we are consistent .
This is therefore an important date for us all .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0271 / 2001 by Mrs Frassoni and Mr Cohn-Bendit , on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group ;
B5-0279 / 2001 by Mr Wurtz and others , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group ;
B5-0286 / 2001 by Mr Zacharakis and others , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group ;
B5-0296 / 2001 by Mr Davies , on behalf of the ELDR Group ,
on the abduction of Mr Tsiakourmas in Cyprus .
B5-0272 / 2001 by Mrs Sörensen , on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group ;
B5-0280 / 2001 by Mrs Morgantini and others , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group ;
B5-0298 / 2001 by Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel and others , on behalf of the ELDR Group ,
on violence towards Catholic nuns .
Pakistan- B5-0265 / 2001 by Mr Fruteau and Mrs Erika Mann , on behalf of the PSE Group ;
B5-0273 / 2001 by Mr Rod and Mrs Maes , on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group ;
B5-0281 / 2001 by Mr Cossutta and others , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group ;
B5-0288 / 2001 by Mrs Martens , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group ;
B5-0299 / 2001 by Mr Van den Bos , on behalf of the ELDR Group ;
B5-0302 / 2001 by Mr Dupuis and others , on behalf of the TDI Group ,
on the situation in Pakistan .
B5-0274 / 2001 by Mr Lagendijk and others , on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group ;
B5-0282 / 2001 by Mr Vinci and others , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group ;
B5-0300 / 2001 by Mrs Van der Laan and Mrs Dybkjær , on behalf of the ELDR Group ,
on the rights of homosexuals in Namibia .
Abduction of Mr Tsiakourmas in Cyprus
The British police investigated the matter and they say :
But these are the words of the British police .
I think that draws a line under the question of what happened .
Commissioner , I turn to you .
Tsiakourmas is , of course , no Dreyfus , Zola or Flaubert .
But , in his own small way , he represents the very same problem .
Mr President , I would like to express my agreement with Mr Katiforis .
The European Union has the means to exert pressure and could use them .
Mr President , this is a straightforward case of illegal actions .
I refuse to choose one side or the other .
Our interest is in a united European Cyprus .
We could perhaps give some funding to the preservation of both sides ' cultural monuments .
But in the meantime Mr Tsiakourmas must not be held hostage .
It seems to have been an ill conceived tit-for-tat .
I have also to say that it is a pity that the resolution contains some unfortunate language .
I say to Turkish Cypriots : avoid stupid incidents and get into constructive dialogue .
Violence towards Catholic nuns
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , unfortunately , the truth here is extremely painful .
Secondly , nuns have been harmed in various countries .
Is this social justice ?
Mr President , the Vatican is not immediately known for its progressive view of sexuality .
The Vatican opposes such measures .
A number of them have also reportedly been infected with AIDS .
Mr President , our group has decided against supporting the present resolution .
We are united in solidarity with the victims .
Sexual abuse by priests must be condemned and penalised without delay .
However , we should not generalise .
There are more than 404 000 priests and nearly 820 000 nuns worldwide .
The Catholic Church has also been offended by the reprehensible actions of some of its members .
In dealing with this matter , understanding and respect for religion are required .
Clearly this is not the position of those tabling the motion .
This resolution could have attacked those who have violated and betrayed the service of God .
It certainly does not deserve this misguided attack .
I voted against the proposal .
Mr President , the Catholic media are reporting on extremely harrowing incidents .
I therefore sincerely hope that this debate will help put an end to these wrongs for good .
The individual ' s responsibility should not disappear in the anonymity of large institutions .
There are no mitigating circumstances for the behaviour of the African priests involved .
We dishonour the name of Christ if we deal with these issues in this way .
Based on my Christian faith , I should like to give my unqualified support to this appeal .
As to the extent of this problem , we can only guess at the moment .
The American magazine ' National Catholic Reporter ' lists 23 countries where sexual abuse occurs .
In any event , it is more than a marginal phenomenon .
Finally , I would like to express my appreciation for the scrapping of recital H from the original resolution .
Bringing a pro-life approach to these issues into discredit in this way is inappropriate .
Mr President , naturally we condemn these disgraceful deeds , whoever perpetrates them .
I believe this issue is too serious to be used as a party-political and ideological football .
However , that is exactly what is happening .
But above all this is an issue for the state authorities .
Of course , we support the Holy See in its efforts to combat these practices .
This is often not the case with the governments of many Member States .
We must not go down this path .
The people of the Church who lend their support to other people do not deserve such defamation .
Mr President , the declaration by Mrs Martens could be mine entirely .
Eventually , the Catholic Church hierarchy reacted to , and condemned , these events .
I also remember bishops , from the Netherlands for example , making statements .
So why are we rubbing salt into the wound of the Roman Catholic Church ?
As a Protestant , I must say that I am very surprised about this , to say the least .
She says : " We are against the Pope visiting the European Parliament .
We must make it more difficult in this way .
The recent arrests of politicians in Pakistan are , unfortunately , a cruel statement of failure .
We too call for a political solution to the Afghan conflict .
The Pakistani Government should put an end to its support for the Taliban regime and the fundamentalist groups .
Among those arrested was Nasrullah Khan , the leader of the democratic renewal movement .
The behaviour of the military regime in Pakistan is absolutely unacceptable .
Credence can no longer be given to the reassurances and declarations of intention given by its ruler .
Pakistan must fulfil its obligations as a member of the United Nations .
The deadlines for these elections to take place must be adhered to .
These elections must take place under the supervision of international observers .
We are obliged to do this .
This would be our contribution to a great national day in Pakistan .
Commissioner , we hope we will succeed .
There is nothing left of democracy , and the prospects are gloomy .
The announcement of elections appears to be no more than a diversion to mislead the international community .
Active party members of the opposition are being apprehended .
Election campaigns have been rendered impossible , and the independence of the judiciary has been compromised .
No democracy means no stability , and no stability means no economic recovery .
Pakistan is becoming increasingly isolated on the world stage .
The financial and military support granted by the military regime to the Taliban barbarians in Afghanistan is repugnant .
The European Union was right to halt the negotiations with Pakistan .
As long as democracy has not been fully re-established , there cannot be any hope of a cooperation agreement .
The Pakistani population must not be left in the lurch .
European development aid must remain focused on education and other social programmes .
Aid for elections can only be granted if it contributes to a fair course of events .
The chance of that happening appears extremely remote for the time being .
The population must be freed from this .
It deserves sunnier prospects .
Rights of homosexuals in Namibia
According to this President , Jews and black people have to be arrested , gaoled and exiled .
End of quote .
You probably wonder which country this report is about , and the timeframe in which it is set .
After all , we are only too aware of the historical examples .
Despite numerous protests , both from Namibia and elsewhere , he repeated this appeal earlier this week .
It is thus not a slip of the tongue but a deliberate campaign .
On previous occasions , the anti-homosexual rhetoric uttered by the Namibian President could be laughed off .
On the contrary , exploiting the fear of AIDS in this manner is playing with fire .
Straightforward advice and the distribution of condoms would be a better solution .
Sexual orientation towards people of the same sex is of all times and all cultures .
Fortunately , there is a steady decrease in discrimination in a large number of countries .
A good example is South Africa .
Homosexual rights are human rights .
Mr President , while the Netherlands allows homosexuals to marry , Namibia despises them .
This is the year 2001 .
His henchmen will take care of the rest .
However , I appreciate how very delicate and difficult this debate is .
In Africa , I found out that many people consider homosexuality as something which goes against their culture .
Homophobic actions , largely orchestrated by the Government , must be unequivocally condemned .
However , this should not be all that is done .
Despite their elevated ideals , certain SADEC countries have recently been repeatedly showing their less attractive sides .
It has emerged that Mr Tsiakourmas was abducted on the sovereign territory of a British base in Dhekalia .
The General Affairs Council is going to look into this case when it meets next Monday .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Lamy .
We naturally also discuss many European issues .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Situation in Mexico
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0262 / 2001 by Mr Seguro and Mr Naïr on behalf of the PSE Group ;
B5-0275 / 2001 by Mr Knörr Borràs and Mr Lipietz on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group ;
B5-0283 / 2001 by Mr Marset Campos and others on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group ;
B5-0289 / 2001 by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra and others on behalf of the PPE-DE Group ;
B5-0297 / 2001 by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and others on behalf of the ELDR Group ,
on the situation in Mexico .
This agreement opens the way for dialogue and understanding .
It is not a case of discussing appearances or whether or not they wear hoods .
They have had more than a hood imposed on them .
Finally they are going to have their rights and they are being recognised in the constitution .
In that way we can support a great hope for Mexico and Latin America .
As you know , this agreement goes well beyond objectives that are related purely to trade and cooperation .
This is an example of the practical measures we are taking at the moment .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
Situation in Somalia and attack against " Médecins sans frontières
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0263 / 2001 by Mr van den Berg on behalf of the PSE Group ;
B5-0276 / 2001 by Mrs Maes and others on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group ;
B5-0284 / 2001 by Mrs Morgantini on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group ;
B5-0290 / 2001 by Mr Van Hecke in behalf of the PPE-DE Group ;
B5-0292 / 2001 by Mrs Muscardini on behalf of the UEN Group ;
B5-0301 / 2001 by Mr van den Bos on behalf of the ELDR Group ,
on the situation in Somalia and attack against " Médecins sans frontières "
What can be the cause of their complaints ?
We must therefore continue to give them our unwavering support .
We must condemn in the strongest possible terms any supply of illegal weapons .
It is the people who are paying the price .
We must send an equally powerful message .
Mr President , for years , Somalia has been left to fend for itself by the international community .
After all , there was no credit to be gained .
Today , Somalia is a fragmented country ruled by a fragmented Government .
The warlords are those who now wield power .
The Arta peace talks brought renewed hope .
A constructive dialogue between the Government and the other leading figures is the only realistic solution .
In fact , as far as I am concerned , this could be one and the same person .
The Commission has granted substantial amounts of humanitarian aid for rehabilitation to Somalia .
Thank you , Commissioner Lamy .
Today the Commission was very disciplined and spoke for less than normal .
( The sitting was suspended at 5.10 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m. )
I think that we need to look for the causes of these accidents and deal with them .
We need to make safety a priority .
He apologises for his absence and has asked me to step into the breach .
' Mr President , first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report .
In the European Union alone more than 2 000 accidents occur every year .
Furthermore , it is important to improve harmonisation and coordination between Member States as a whole .
Besides this , further awareness regarding safety in the fisheries sector is necessary .
Information campaigns and education are important tools to achieve this .
I would like to add a few personal comments . I agree with all these statements .
Recently I was on board a shrimp trawler in Greenland .
Fishing communities keep alive the memories of tragic events , which they pass on from generation to generation .
Congratulations , Mrs Miguélez Ramos .
We must also urge ship-owners to make use of technological developments .
In this sector , there is a tradition of fatalism , which is related to the natural elements .
Casualties at sea have , unfortunately , become an integral part of the fishing profession .
Such risks are preventable if safety forms an integral part of fisheries management .
I therefore urge Members to support Amendment No 6 .
I support this proposition .
There have been similar cases in Scottish waters in recent years .
Finally , many fishermen think that learning to swim is a bad omen .
The Commission entirely agrees with you .
The safety of our fishermen must be given top priority .
The framework directive and the specific directives cover both these spheres of action .
Having said that , we must note that more and more accidents are occurring in the fisheries sector .
The Commission can agree with you fully .
First of all , the Member States must also implement the provisions of the directives .
Moreover , the directives contain a reporting duty for the Member States with different timetables .
Here too , however , we are dealing with minimum requirements .
However , the best rules are useless if they are not complied with correctly or at all .
Monitoring and control are the main problems .
But these fall exclusively within the remit of the Member States .
We must therefore urge them to apply the provisions correctly .
By way of conclusion , Mrs Miguélez Ramos , I can agree with you fully .
Your initiative is an important step towards achieving this goal .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
I have no idea how I am going to fill the seven minutes allotted to me .
But this is a very serious matter .
Europe is becoming increasingly concerned with the role of the liberal professions .
We have liberalised markets in many areas of the European Union .
This is very much to be welcomed .
I have now spoken for six minutes .
I will forego my last minute .
Whether a rule is a purely professional rule must be determined from one case to the next .
Justification on grounds of professional ethics is not recognised .
In areas in which compulsory uniform tariffs apply , competition must result from quality .
I think that it is only starting to see the outer layer of the problems .
At times it seems that quality is very important , and I agree with this interpretation .
That is what we want to see the Commission look at .
Let me give you two UK-based examples .
First , price : should this be regulated ?
But to vary a couple of words in the self-same document , they proposed to charge me GBP 500 .
That , to me , is licensed robbery by our profession .
They need to be challenged .
He had had no help from my profession 's complaints body .
That is why I ask colleagues to support the amendments tabled by my group .
Commission . ( DE ) Mr President , I would like to add just a few more comments .
In fact the first rule dates back to 1993 .
This ruling will prepare the way for the adoption of further measures .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
( The sitting was suspended at 6.25 p.m. and resumed at 6.30 p.m. ) ( )
Adjournment of the session
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament .
( The sitting was closed at 6.45 p.m. )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 5 April .
Relating to Wednesday 2 May :
Is that a correct interpretation of Rule 6 ?
Yes , Mr Wurtz , you are right .
The Council did not believe that it was in a position to make this statement .
Of course , there would not be much point without the Council .
The Council can , however , attend the sitting of 14 May .
( Applause from the left )
I believe I am right in saying that all the political groups were also in favour of this .
At that time , 17 prisoners had died .
Since then , there have been a further two deaths .
A further 160 prisoners are in a critical condition .
( Applause from the left )
Thank you , Mr Wurtz .
We have also had a meeting on this subject today .
I particularly wanted to mention that .
Madam President , it is a matter of regret that the Council is not represented here today .
( Applause )
That is why we asked the Turkish government to take action .
The positions in Turkey are clearly evident today .
We can find a solution in two days .
Relating to Thursday 3 May :
It seems that this proposal enjoys a very broad consensus .
This means that the deadline for tabling amendments would be 12 noon on Thursday 10 May .
( Parliament approved the proposal )
Speeches relating to procedure
In these circumstances , do you agree that it is all the more urgent to proceed rapidly ?
What is the current situation ?
As you said , there was a meeting of the Conference of Presidents .
I thought that this very comprehensive document would be of great use .
You have access to this document .
I am sure that it will have been sent to you through the appropriate channels .
At the Conference of Presidents , three decisions were taken .
There would therefore be grounds for wondering whether there is a need to amend Parliament 's Rules of Procedure .
I believe that the coordinators of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs are meeting tomorrow to appoint a rapporteur .
I believe that it is available to you , again , through the appropriate channels .
I think that you are aware of the situation .
I am saying to you in all sincerity that this only adds to my doubts .
Who are they trying to embarrass here ?
This is the first time that floods have hit our département .
Substantial damage has been caused , and the people of the area are suffering untold misery and despair .
People are showing great solidarity at local and regional level and help is being mobilised at national level .
This area of France , which is already badly affected by economic and social problems , has been devastated .
( Applause from the right )
Mr Corbett , you say you are concerned about the reputation of the European Parliament .
( Applause from the right )
The President made a discreet reference to the reason .
Why is it that Mrs Garaud has been unable to undertake the mission ?
It is because her husband has died .
We offer her our sincere sympathy .
I am saying this so that there can be no more insinuations here .
( Applause from the right )
However , we need to recognise that the Conference of Presidents reached a unanimous decision .
That was a unanimous decision .
( Applause from the right )
I believe the committee would have been very happy to do that .
( Applause from the Verts / ALE Group )
Thank you , Mrs Hautala .
You may , of course , make a statement on behalf of your group .
I must , however , just pick up on two points that were inaccurate .
There were three requests to waive the parliamentary immunity of Spanish MEPs .
Two requests were sent directly through the intermediary of the Spanish governmental authorities .
There is only one request where there is some doubt .
The Official Journal reports that it was sent by the Spanish government .
This information that I have given you is new and extremely important information .
We cannot continue to beat about the bush .
I am totally shocked by what you have just said , Mrs Frassoni .
I think that , in all the years spent working in Parliament , I have shown
I am able to prove this very easily , Mrs Frassoni .
Madam President , thank you for your explanation .
This is important .
I have said this to you in public and in private .
This therefore justifies the letter that I sent to you with the agreement of my Group .
My Group still considers that this issue should be announced in public .
First of all , the problem could have been avoided .
Therefore , there is a very simple solution to the matter under consideration .
I did not wish to use these arguments .
Because your colleague , Mr Brok , says that the answer is no .
Please do me the favour of answering the House .
( Applause from the left )
You have just done a great job in showing that this issue is certainly of a political nature .
However , I should like to return to the subject of the law .
You said that respecting the Rules of Procedure meant referral to the committee responsible .
This MEP was Mrs Marie-Claude Vayssade , Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
I am slightly weary of these groundless accusations and we know exactly what lies at the root of them .
I must start my speech by referring to certain allusions that have been made .
I am surprised at the tone of this debate .
Mrs Frassoni started by making an accusation that I think discredits itself .
That is not the point of the issue , as you so rightly pointed out .
We need to give it that time .
Finally , Madam President what is the problem that we are faced with ?
( Applause from the right )
That is very important .
It is equally important and vital to avoid giving that impression .
We should get them into Parliament as quickly as possible .
( Applause from the Verts / ALE Group )
The reason is quite obvious .
The situation in my country is very delicate .
The question is very complex .
We are but a few weeks , or even a few days , away from Italian national elections .
Mr Manisco , I do understand that some Members are finding that this matter is dragging on .
The matter will then be perfectly clear .
I was not making a party political point .
I was making a point on behalf of this Parliament .
You can tell me what you thought of what I am about to say in a moment .
You may even be slightly troubled by this .
That is what is unacceptable . We must not accept it .
I defend what you have done .
I hope and believe you would similarly defend any Member .
We discussed the matter of precedents at length and the two precedents were rather interesting .
One was an Italian case which came as a direct reference from a court .
All this has left you in a very difficult and delicate position , Madam President .
Madam President , I do not think that anyone could doubt the uprightness of your actions .
I would like to end by reminding Mr Manisco that the law is not a protocol formality .
Thank you , Mr Tajani .
We have reached the end of this debate .
I think that this is precisely the problem , Mrs Frassoni .
The conviction was upheld last week .
A further video was offered to the Belgian authorities by the UK police .
The Belgian police refused to take that further evidence .
I believe the decision by the Court was more about propping up the fast-track trial procedure than about justice .
I hope , Madam President , you will help us in that endeavour .
Thank you , Mrs Lynne .
Madam President , very soon the European Parliament will vote on public access to documents .
Can you offer any advice in this situation ?
Thank you , Mrs Scallon .
We shall see what can be done in order to make this possible .
EU / UN partnership on development and humanitarian issues
Mr President , I welcome the statement .
It is the best quality support .
Can he count on their support in achieving this communication ?
Secondly , I note with satisfaction the incredible importance of cooperation on particular themes .
The EU ' s input will be required in this area too .
To Mr Deva , we will not just give the money .
We are not contemplating core funding .
Mr President , we have taken good note of this decision by the Commission .
I saw a lot of time wasted this afternoon .
As regards the humanitarian side , it is quite different .
We are trying to establish a balance using them and NGOs .
This is very much in line with what I have announced as the next logical and necessary step .
This is what we are aiming at .
We welcome it and we may also participate , but the real problem is delivery on the ground .
May I thank the Commission for an excellent initiative on our relationship with the UN .
I would like to thank the Commissioner for the statement he has just made .
Do you think they have the capacity to deal with such a large amount of money ?
And if not , are the United Nations organisations helping to build that capacity ?
The EU policy is to move towards regional cooperation and integration .
Is that also a policy that the United Nations organisations are following and will support ?
How will this continue to be organised or coordinated ?
Things are better now than they used to be .
So from case to case it looks somewhat better today .
I have already mentioned protection and security .
It is these two added together which is the 90 % .
We have a good partnership in this and good support .
This is the self-confidence .
I should like to ask the Commission how this is done at the moment .
Does the European Commission fulfil a coordinating role at that Assembly ?
My second question relates to the United Nations ' refugee work .
I know that resources have been cut considerably in this respect .
This would indeed be good news for the new High Commissioner .
Will he bring forward to this Parliament plans to do more work in that area ?
Mental health is the fastest growing cause of disability .
That is a disgrace to the world .
We can do more .
Will he commit this Parliament , this Union , and this Commission to do more as well .
We are not asking for a new legal basis .
We are asking for a closer partnership .
This is the final round of the war of accountants , but it is in fact still on .
But we can only do this when we have the financial regulation changed .
Mr Bowis , I agree that the issue of mental health is a very large one .
From a human point of view this needs more attention .
This is as important as sticking to the line of giving prevention absolute priority .
We are trying to keep the broad picture of all these diseases at the top of the agenda .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Nielson .
The debate is closed .
Request for the waiver of Peter Sichrovsky 's immunity
Immunity is not a privilege granted to an individual Member of Parliament .
His political position on the basis of his religious affiliation , in other words .
I will develop this point in my forthcoming speeches .
I am just telling you that , so that we all have the same information .
Thank you very much for your understanding .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Request for the waiver of Johannes Voggenhuber 's immunity
That concludes the debate .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11a.m.
Request for the waiver of Elisabeth Jeggle 's immunity
This case raises no such issue .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.a.m.
Public access to documents
Of course the text does not go as far as we would have liked .
It is by no means a step backwards .
The text would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of the Swedish Presidency .
It has to be shown that such an exception is necessary and the disclosure would cause harm .
The exceptions are therefore discretionary , not mandatory .
Virtually all documents will be placed on a public register .
Finally , this is not the end of the beginning .
This European Parliament has pressed for this to happen for years .
In November , our Parliament tabled its proposal with a huge majority .
In the case of huge public interest , documents are to be disclosed nevertheless .
That was a key element for our Parliament .
Secondly , the term " document " should be taken in a broad sense .
Electronic mail also falls under this heading .
This is clearly stipulated in recital 16 .
I should like to see it explained accordingly .
Is this Regulation now perfect ?
If we were to overhaul the Regulation now , we would end up in a long-term codecision procedure .
I should first like to thank Mr Cashman .
I would like to illustrate certain problems with this Regulation by showing you a small object .
This is a Russian wooden doll .
Let us imagine that this doll is the Regulation on transparency in question .
When we open up the doll we find new dolls inside . This is just how these rules work .
And , at the end , who do we find but Mr Solana himself !
The European Parliament emphasised the importance of greater transparency in the EU ' s institutions early on .
It means that people are entitled under the Treaty to be given access to these documents .
Parliament ' s representatives , in particular , have campaigned vigorously and persistently for such rules .
We consequently have an obligation to do everything that can be done to fulfil these expectations .
Ultimately , it is the EU ' s credibility that is at stake .
Secondly , new and better provisions are needed .
The proposal on which Parliament is to adopt a position is a clear improvement upon the current legal position .
It is a proposal of its time .
In many cases , documents will be accessible directly via the Internet .
It will also be possible , just as before , for documents to be handed over upon written request .
The time which the institutions now have in which to respond to a request has been cut back .
This improvement is also a result of the European Parliament ' s initiative .
The new rules will markedly improve citizens ' access to EU documents .
Through the new rules , the European Union will gain increased public confidence and acquire increased democratic legitimacy .
However good the new rules may be , they must be adapted little by little to new requirements .
It is now up to the European Parliament to decide .
The Commission therefore believes that the draft regulation before us today is of particular importance and significance .
It is now the task of Parliament to deliver a completely independent opinion on the outcome of this work .
Naturally , ladies and gentlemen , the text is probably far from perfect .
It is very likely that not everybody will be pleased with every aspect .
I heard Mrs Hautala use a symbolic expression earlier , involving Russian dolls .
Mrs Hautala , I do not think that you will find Mr Solana if you open all the boxes .
In this respect , it does , in all sincerity , represent the best possible compromise .
In previous proposals , it was enough that releasing a document might harm the public interest .
There are still critics of the compromise .
How much control would the public have exercised then ?
The agreement is a considerable improvement on the Commission proposal and on the existing regulations .
Fortunately , that is not the case .
That is why this is the right time for me to adopt this compromise .
That was not acceptable to us .
The European Commission ' s evaluation in January 2004 will certainly need to lead to adjustments .
The Court too has to accept this veto .
Public access to documents is , of course , the very stuff of democracy .
The conclusion is that this proposal is really worse than nothing .
All we can do is vote for or against .
I too would have preferred a more far-reaching compromise .
However , I think that for the time being we must be satisfied with what has been achieved .
I would like to reiterate the basic principles of that opinion , which are still valid today .
These principles require an administration to be legitimate , efficient , responsible and meaningful for the public .
Furthermore , they provide protection against arbitrary actions and the abuse of power .
Any necessary exceptions to this principle should be justified .
This has now been firmly established .
I would also like to see a coordinating body facilitating all this .
We shall see how this works in practice .
That can be covered in the revised version .
The answer is no .
There are details in this document about which we have reservations and which we could wish were better .
That applies , for example , to the issues surrounding documents of a sensitive nature .
Even though discussions have taken place , the procedure is not especially open .
My answer is an unqualified yes .
It constitutes substantial progress in relation to the present situation .
I really cannot understand those who say that it is a retrograde step .
The answer is an unqualified yes .
That , if anything , surely constitutes progress .
The proposal is not , therefore , a retrograde step for those countries which have more open legislation .
All this does constitute substantial progress .
It is quite clear that we in Parliament must vote in favour of this proposal .
People want the institutions to be more open .
I would like too to thank the rapporteurs of other committees for their considerable contribution .
Many of us would have liked wider rights and fewer exceptions .
The wording concerning sensitive documents is too general and too vague .
In that case , it is a substantial infringement of the Swedish constitution .
In some areas , it is downright worse than the EU ' s existing practice .
Respect for national rules on transparency is not guaranteed by the proposal .
National rules are subordinate to an EU Regulation .
What are called ' sensitive documents ' do not even need to be shown in the registers .
It is an unfortunate confusion of different issues which ought not to have happened .
This is not the time to conclude this work , for it is not complete .
The conciliation ought to continue as normal .
Documents which are at present in the public domain may be classified tomorrow .
At present , we in practice operate with common minimum rules governing transparency .
It is possible for those countries that wish to do so to go further .
The EU Regulation makes the rules the same in every country .
That is good for consistency but bad for transparency .
We are now to be given common maximum rules on transparency .
See the text on euobserver.com , if you do not have it in your briefcases .
The various forms of progress have , of course , been decided upon ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
That needs to be stressed here today .
I hope at least that we as Members will derive some benefit from this .
If there are now to be some exceptions to this , then I regard that as positive .
So we should maintain this balance here and certainly not abandon it .
Both of these are bad and we do not want either .
I would like to congratulate everyone who has worked on this report and been involved in this outcome .
You talk about a crowning achievement , a historical decision , a milestone .
It reminds me of Faust - Gretchen would have liked to record this day .
But receiving the EU 's proposal here is rather like getting to see a new car .
" Now you can have a look ! " they tell us .
We certainly will .
Will we now get to see what documents really exist and which ones are sensitive ?
What does sensitivity mean ?
We are all very sensitive .
How will you interpret sensitivity ?
Or will we get there and see the whole car ?
I believe that there is room for optimism when you look at the example of the United States .
There is money available for that .
In the USA , the Freedom of Information Act costs USD 40 million every year .
The bill for the American Government 's public relations is USD 1.5 billion .
I share the opinion of our rapporteur , Mr Cashman , who is to be congratulated .
He says that this is something that will develop by itself .
We are relying on it developing by itself up to 2004 .
Quite a few of us voted for making the EU more open .
It is a step forwards in many ways .
It lays down important principles , a fact which quite a few of my fellow MEPs have touched upon .
However , we Liberals are also sorry to see that it is deficient in a great many ways .
This is an unfortunate rule which may be interpreted arbitrarily .
What happens if a document is secret in Brussels but in the public domain in Stockholm ?
Those of us who believe in transparency must constantly fight to demonstrate that the opposite is the case .
Public scrutiny is not dangerous . Rather , it is democratic and efficient .
Further efforts are required in this regard , and we shall test the limits of the legislation .
But I am not thrilled with the end result .
The procedures are not particularly wonderful .
Many phrases are so vague that they could be interpreted in any which way in practice .
It is utopian to believe that we will always reach the ideal policy at European level .
The range of opinions on the desired transparency is unfortunately too wide for that to happen .
The most achievable result is then a compromise which , in fact , satisfies nobody .
This is a reality which we must accept .
Let me be clear .
This report does not go as far as I would like .
We welcome the assumption of access and hope it proves just that .
It does not give us freedom of information , but merely freer information .
The latter , however , is a goal well worth achieving .
Nevertheless , it is a political pleasure to be here .
We have achieved a compromise and made certain gains .
It is also important that the exceptions are more limited than those proposed by the Commission .
It is interesting to see what was dispensed with .
Citizens will be able to monitor the Commission ' s activity in a completely new way .
Many images have been used today .
We have acquired a powerful tool .
We must respect the meaning of the words .
What we have here are marked improvements .
Transparency does not come about through legislation alone , however .
It also depends upon a culture of transparency .
Transparency ought not to be perceived as an inconvenience for the administration .
Transparency is an advantage , not only for democracy but also for the authorities to which it extends .
We must see how the new rules work .
I can well understand why the compromise has been called a victory for the willingness to negotiate .
In other words , our points of view were worlds apart .
We Danes have a special love-hate relationship with our Swedish neighbours .
We shall carefully monitor the implementation of the result that has now been achieved .
Mrs Kessler might want to do the same at the end .
Hardly any representatives from southern European countries have spoken .
The debate and vote on the first draft report was held on 16 November 2000 .
The rapporteurs were given a clear mandate by Parliament for discussion with the Council .
The European Parliament 's Conference of Presidents also gave their clear political support .
Things move on .
This Union has moved on .
Post Nice , we have a security policy .
It is right that we operate properly and responsibly .
Thank you very much , Mr Cashman .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
EU / FYROM Agreement
This has certainly not happened without various debates and problems .
In a democracy , no one should bring bombs and murder to the negotiating table .
Violence and terror tactics should not be rewarded .
Some of the provisions of the constitution have also been called into doubt .
That would not help anyone except the extremists themselves .
( Applause )
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I could actually say that Johannes Swoboda has said it all .
I could say exactly that .
However , perhaps I can highlight some slightly different points .
This demonstrates whom Parliament has decided in favour of .
However , we must also make it clear in Macedonia that this Union is a Union of values .
We need to fight together against criminality .
I deeply regret , in particular , the death of four Macedonian soldiers in the last few days .
So we need to fight together against criminals and agitators .
Albanian terrorism must be condemned , but Slav-Macedonian nationalism is not an appropriate response to it .
There are many areas of policy in Macedonia where assistance is needed .
But they need jobs and they need prospects .
I am sure that in conjunction with the Commission we will do everything to achieve this .
Macedonia has been a nightmare for the West for years .
Well then , it cannot do without dialogue or the country will fall to pieces .
So , we must continue to make good progress .
My group , in any case , has decided to make a determined effort to achieve this .
This , Mr President , is the agreement that has been reached .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , I was just about to say that the issue of information is also fundamental .
I will now turn to the issue which is more central to our debate , the issue ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
You must admit that this is going too far .
At last , we have an agreement .
These frustrations are far-reaching .
So federalism cannot provide a solution ?
In my opinion , Mrs Pack , quite the contrary : we must consider federalism .
Federalism does not necessarily bring division .
The ethnic disturbances in the city of Bitola are further proof of this .
I would appreciate it if both the Council and Commission could shed some light on this .
That is something which we will not forget in a hurry .
It was not an easy task and we will not forget this .
A boycott was introduced , the effects of which Macedonia had to shoulder .
But there is more .
A Stabilisation and Association Agreement is the first step towards EU membership .
It underlines the focus on Europe and on European values .
We hope that the Macedonian model will be copied promptly by the others .
There are already negotiations under way with Croatia .
With regard to Albania , preparations to that effect are being made .
And we should not overlook Bosnia , of course .
That is a form of conflict prevention .
We have actually noticed these effects in the candidate countries .
This agreement is the right move in the right direction .
However , it is a fragile agreement .
Eight policemen and soldiers were killed the other day .
The response from a few irresponsible people in Bitola , a bomb at the airport .
Only then can there be political stability .
Otherwise we shall come back in a few years ' time to count up our mistakes .
It is very important that the European Union and Yugoslavia normalise diplomatic relations .
It is a familiar tactic .
Unfortunately , it has proven effective and we must oppose it .
The negotiations were launched by the Commission on 5 March 2000 .
As honourable Members are aware , this is a critical period in Fyrom 's history .
Thank you all for your contributions and thank you also to Mr Swoboda .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Wallström .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Nuclear safety fifteen years after Chernobyl
The commemoration of this event provides us with an opportunity to reflect upon nuclear safety in the region .
On 15 December 2000 , Ukraine shut down definitively the Chernobyl nuclear power plant .
Nuclear safety is a priority for the European Union .
The strategy followed by the EU was in line with the G7 multilateral programme of action .
The case of the Russian Federation is particularly important .
Some 15 % of electricity in Russia is generated by nuclear power .
An enormous quantity of spent fuel from nuclear submarines is stored under very poor conditions .
This poses a major threat to the Barents Sea and the Arctic environment .
It is not .
We are right to say in our resolution that there is widespread concern .
We want help for the Ukraine .
We have nine new nuclear power stations there with 27 reactors .
Of which we know that three power stations with eight reactors are to be shut down .
The Commission has a debt to discharge here .
It is a question of the utmost interest to all of us and all of our citizens .
These are the pressing practical matters which must follow from the voting of this resolution .
Is that at least not something we should be able to agree about ?
In Belarus , 18 per cent of the total population live in a heavily polluted environment .
These figures are extremely high , considering what they mean for individual people .
Just as Commissioner Wallström pointed out , children are the most vulnerable .
The question is whether we have learned anything since then .
Is the precautionary principle being applied today ?
Food from the polluted area remains unsuitable for consumption .
That is the finding in a report by the Otto-Hug-Institut at Munich University .
The repercussions could become apparent in seven million people over the next 50 to 70 years .
Because there is no money , people over the age of 45 are no longer being treated .
Meaning that they will die .
We call on the European Union to issue strict , uniform nuclear safety standards .
I need only think of Bohunice , Kozlodoui or Ignalina .
These power stations cannot be upgraded , even with the very best western technology .
In Austria no one - not one party - is in favour of using nuclear energy .
We have learned to accept that we cannot force others to follow our example .
Commissioner , the same thing has been put to you twice today already .
But we must have a minimum consensus .
We shall soon have a common currency - wonderful .
We also hear talk of standard shapes for cucumbers .
So why no minimum consensus here ?
I have tried to achieve a minimum consensus in my group .
I believe that Mr Mombaur or Mr Chichester will be tabling an oral amendment tomorrow .
If we cannot , then what I want to know is why we bother about the shape of cucumbers .
In the latter country , nearly two and a half million people were exposed to radioactivity .
A great deal of materials polluted by the explosion need to be stored and processed .
Ukraine ' s main river , the Dnepr , is still at risk of becoming contaminated .
The situation in Belarus is possibly worse still .
The health situation is alarming , especially for the children .
Its policy is often counterproductive and screens the problem from the outside world .
The international community is involved , albeit on a small scale .
NGOs carry out their work under difficult conditions .
But that , of course , is not enough by a long chalk .
Relations between the European Union and the undemocratic government in Belarus are strained .
We can understand that .
I am not convinced by the argument that neither TACIS nor ECHO allow this .
Let us for once overstep our own political and bureaucratic boundaries .
Victims , human lives are being lost to cancer .
For example , what has been said about Kozlodoui ?
Surely this is a very long time to leave dangerous reactors in operation .
And why ?
Because there are financial considerations .
Well , let us deal with the financial considerations .
The reactors may even be sold to private individuals .
For the love of God , how can they say such things ?
I think that , if money needs to be spent , Commissioner , we should spend it .
The financial problem is secondary .
The most important considerations are the environment and health , the public health of the citizens of Europe .
An area about the size of Britain is permanently contaminated and uninhabitable .
There has been continuous monitoring for 15 years and the restrictions will last for another 10-15 years .
We must have sustainable energy policies .
Nuclear power is no solution .
It is not clean and it is not cheap .
Nothing illustrates that better than Chernobyl and we have to learn from it .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much for the debate .
These issues also illustrate the nature and character of the environmental problems .
These must then be followed up in order to ensure that they are really being implemented .
I have been asked what standards are applied .
What does that mean ?
We are still vulnerable , and we still have a problem with waste .
That is incredibly important , I believe .
Thank you for the debate .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Wallström .
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
( The sitting was suspended at 8.28 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
Protection of euro against counterfeiting
The names of Mr Kohl and Mr Delors ought to be mentioned in this context .
With the euro , European integration is taking a giant step forward .
The euro will become one of the most significant and most important currencies in international trade .
Unfortunately , they have their legal bases in two different pillars , the first and the third .
How can citizens be expected to carry detection equipment the same size as a large PC around with them ?
This is a position which Parliament definitely ought to adopt in order to protect people .
However , those who adopt the euro can be party to decisions on the same conditions as other members .
Those who do not adopt the euro do not , unfortunately , have the same influence .
It is about nothing other than political leadership .
The fact that Sweden , in contrast , did not is something I deeply regret .
Thank you , Mr President .
It will be the cornerstone on which to build a political union .
They are going to be the key players in detecting counterfeit currency .
It is also a guarantee that the money distributed by these bodies will be authentic .
I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Cederschiöld on her excellent report and the recommendations contained therein .
Of course the circulation of the euro will have both positive and negative impacts .
I shall therefore take it upon myself to do so .
It may have been designed to do exactly that .
Yet , who is going to pay the price for this huge risk ?
We are asking the national and European authorities not to shirk their responsibilities .
Otherwise , then , we should provide small businesses with free detectors for forged banknotes .
Some will say to me that we do not have the money to do that .
I shall reply that we should have thought of this before .
She said that we cannot allow counterfeiting to undermine our single currency .
Therefore , for all of these reasons , the security of our currency is extremely important .
Congratulations , Mrs Cederschiöld !
I would like to congratulate her on the overall thrust of the report .
My concerns are twofold , however .
There is a threat and an opportunity with the introduction of the euro .
The European Parliament has dealt with the preparations and the necessary steps right from the start .
I should like to remind you that the Commission has submitted various proposals since its communication in July 1998 .
An advisory committee has been set up to help the Commission here .
Various additional instruments have already been adopted or are currently being prepared .
We are not underestimating the problems , we are tackling them .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Illegal substances - Synthetic drugs
Mr President , we are now to deal with the issue of synthetic drugs .
Europe is a world leader in the manufacture of synthetic drugs .
That is not a fact to be too proud of .
This initiative against synthetic drugs ought therefore to be warmly welcomed .
The proposal is based upon a highly developed method of analysis applied by certain laboratories .
The Member States are obliged to send samples of certain drugs that have been confiscated to particular laboratories .
At present , such laboratories unfortunately exist only in Sweden , Germany and the Netherlands .
In that way , the relevant skills will be extended throughout the European Union .
The second decision concerns the actual transmission of samples of controlled narcotic substances .
The Member States are obliged to allow these to pass through their territory .
It must also be underlined that the system proposed is not definitive .
It is not perfect in every respect . I know that .
I completely share that view .
The report also states that the method of transport must be continually reviewed .
That would be deeply regrettable .
There is now every reason for us to join together in offering just such a compromise .
These are the latest figures available .
And all of these drugs are taken , by more and more youngsters .
The producers and traffickers who deal in these drugs are part of organised crime .
I therefore welcome the Swedish initiative because it takes a step forward here .
Both instruments are essential in the fight against drugs and organised crime .
The objective , and I know that it is an ambitious objective , is to achieve a drugs-free society .
It will be no easy task but these measures certainly take us a step closer to this objective .
Drugs cause harm when they are abused .
I therefore think that this initiative will not be much help .
That is why I think that we should not agree to this repressive measure .
But that is exactly where the problem lies .
Setting up laboratories presupposes that the criteria are sufficiently clear and the procedures transparent .
The Commission has been working in this area for some time .
All these elements show how important this debate is at world scale .
Thank you , Commissioner Vitorino .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
She is one of the most energetic , enterprising and intelligent members of the committee .
She is in Berlin tonight and is to have an operation in the morning .
Dagmar Roth-Behrendt intended to move one of the two amendments tonight .
So , from the point of view of my group , we are not supporting any amendments .
I think it was 16 May last year , the time of the first reading .
Not a lot has happened since in one sense .
It must be taken relative to the cattle population in each country .
This is not an indication that the disease is spreading , because we are get increased numbers .
It is not .
BSE is a disease of older cows , primarily older dairy cows .
I do not mind underpinning the market .
That could be part of it .
Again , we have not been telling the story as it is .
Congratulations to all concerned .
I should like to take this opportunity to ask us to think in the longer term .
The situation requires a certain humility on our part .
It would also be a good idea if we were to give a little consideration to our own history .
Our forefathers knew perfectly well that animals that had died of natural causes should not be eaten .
Today , we are discussing a package of measures which was announced back in 1997 .
All of this is of crucial importance .
The measures must also be able to count on the commitment in Brussels and in the Member States .
That is a deciding factor .
With this statement , he was , in fact , vague once again .
Confidence can be restored by means of a credible policy and clear language .
Safety , prevention , control and eradication of BSE now require political commitment .
In this way , BSE became the cause of a complete overhaul of European food policy .
A European food authority is set up and we re-establish the principles of policy on foodstuffs .
But our discussion goes further than that , of course .
We must now take a good look at food production .
And we should not wait six years to achieve this .
The Regulation under discussion will help in the harmonisation of the legal basis .
The Regulation takes account of scientific development .
The rapporteur is proposing two amendments .
This is not necessarily a sensible solution for all Member States .
There should also be immediate 100 % compensation for the animals slaughtered on these farms .
If all the animals are slaughtered they are left without their livelihood .
We now have to shift the emphasis from quantity to quality .
Consumer confidence dropped to a record low .
Faced with this crisis , the position of Council , Parliament and the Commission drew closer .
The Council agreed to additional demands from Parliament increasing the number of tested animals .
Consequently , the common position of Council was adopted by unanimity and endorsed by the Commission .
This compares with the very sharp differences in approach in the past on BSE-related issues .
In this resolution , Parliament asked for several protection measures .
Further amendments at second reading would , however , delay formal action upon this resolution .
It is vital , therefore , that this regulation enters into force as soon as possible .
Neither of the two proposed amendments falls , in my view , into these categories .
I cannot accept Amendment No 1 for reasons of substance also .
This is against the principles of laying down Community rules .
These are in addition to the tests on fallen animals and at-risk animals .
May I just comment briefly on some of the contributions made by some Members a moment ago .
This particular proposal is compatible with the OIE international standards .
Thank you , Commissioner Byrne .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Movement of pets
The proposal also allows the free movement of insects , fish and some other animals .
I hope that we can reach agreement on the legal base .
Tattoos can cause problems , they can become difficult to read or they can be altered .
If this scheme is to be successful , it is crucial that it is operated effectively .
The use of specified ISO transponders would help achieve this .
A controversial issue has been that of ferrets and whether or not they should be included in this regulation .
In the course of dealing with this matter , the legal basis has been changed .
The change is explained in terms of the fact that the Regulation is aimed at protecting public health .
Examples include aggressive forms of distemper .
There are now scientific proofs that vaccinating ferrets against rabies is effective .
Completely to omit ferrets is irresponsible .
We have to be a little more lenient there .
Finally , ferrets .
I would happy to go along with that .
I am sure the Commission has too .
The reality is that ferrets seem to have caused no particular problems .
Mr President , I will start where my colleague finished .
I would not like the job myself .
I must confess a conflict of interest at the start .
They feel very strongly that only a standard microchip should be used .
Remember it is 8 years down the line .
We have plenty of time to sort this out and get things in order .
Initially , we also thought that microchip numbers could be changed .
Tattoos , however , are much less satisfactory .
I will begin with the amendments the Commission cannot accept .
This is one of the reasons why Article 37 is included as a legal base .
Hence the need for Article 37 rather than Article 152 .
This is not consistent with the conditions applicable to internal movements .
This would be a discrimination which is not scientifically sound , and therefore Amendment No 10 is not acceptable .
Finally , the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 14 .
Therefore I can accept this amendment .
Thank you , Commissioner Byrne .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Mr President , I welcome the Commissioner to the House .
This is what the Commission proposes and I fully endorse it .
They announced these measures to increase the availability of products .
But major species have also been affected .
There are many different perspectives to be reconciled .
Unfortunately , no satisfactory solution has yet been found .
This legislation is currently being reviewed .
Obviously , these legislative changes will take some time .
Such an exploration would only be possible under certain conditions .
Thus , a need for appropriate analytical methods of control will have to be considered .
Thank you , Commissioner Liikanen .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
( The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m. )
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
( The Minutes were approved )
Nevertheless , the list of sources of pressure and oppression against journalists is a long one .
That is indeed the case , Mr Wurtz .
We have certainly taken account of the statement you have just made .
We do not have the time to write to Mr Pastrana again .
Thank you very much Mrs González Álvarez .
Stability and convergence programmes
Mr Katiforis has the floor for seven minutes .
It was the example to be eschewed in the European Union .
Few believed that it would be able to resolve these problems .
Unfortunately , these rates of growth are unlikely to continue .
The stability programmes presented indicate that the Member States are aware of these needs .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to start by thanking Mr Katiforis for his report .
What exactly is this report about ?
In May 1998 , resolutions were passed making economic and monetary union a reality .
At the time , economic and monetary union and the introduction of a European currency were irreversible .
What were they based on back then ?
We must remember what this Stability and Growth Pact calls for .
Today , the important thing is to achieve a balanced budget or a surplus .
So what news on this front ?
That is one very good point .
On the other hand , however , we must face the facts .
The Bible exhorts us to save in fat years for the lean years ahead .
We must face up to these risks .
Now to my group ' s stand on the Katiforis report .
We can support it , as it now stands .
It did , however , always include growth factors .
Mr von Wogau , you referred to possible dangers .
I only wish that Mr Katiforis ' words would be attended to in my own country .
The Union ' s economic policy stands out for its passivity and its dogmatism .
With regard to the medium-term , however , it refers us to the structural reforms .
This is clearly absurd .
What , however , do we say about it ?
I think that this is the way forward .
Take , for example , our resolutions on reducing social security contributions coupled with wage moderation .
Our social and public spending contributes to keeping workers poor .
This requires a large contribution from public funds .
All of this would require a real increase in investment .
Mr President , I support economic cooperation within the European Union .
From an Irish perspective the stability programme is central to the budgetary process .
Needless to say , I fully support the policies being pursued by our Minister for Finance .
Our inflation rate is now lower than that in a number of other EU Member States .
Mr President , over the past year , we have seen a slight improvement in the budgetary situation .
The favourable economic tide should have been used to bring about reforms .
Whether you like it or not , the ECB ' s objective is price stability .
Moreover , the real interest level is low enough to offer an incentive for growth .
The stability and convergence programmes are right to confine themselves to the monetary policy .
Mr President , we have all seen the European indicators .
Economic growth in Europe is slowing down .
Under no circumstances , however , should we simply increase public investment .
We need more forwards on the European economy team .
For me , reducing debt means taking responsibility for the future .
The Stability and Growth Pact is therefore a question of responsibility for the future .
I should like to call on everyone to put an end to the lassitude which has set in .
Mr President , I want first of all to welcome Giorgos Katiforis ' s report .
You will no doubt soon hear Herman Schmid express something similar .
There is an alarming tendency towards complete centralisation within the Euroland countries .
The relative weakness of the euro against the dollar seems to have triggered a number of excessive reactions .
EMU must not become a straightjacket for Europe .
Mr President , Mr Schmidt is absolutely right .
Despite the fact that the economic reality is changing , policy has to remain fixed .
Mr President , there has been a marked slowdown in the rate of growth in the EU economy .
The Commission and the IMF have revised growth forecasts from above 3 % to 2.8 % .
The rate of inflation is 0.3 of a percentage point above the 2 % ceiling .
We all know why this is . Exploding oil prices , agricultural problems , the depreciation in the euro .
There is absolutely no cause for the passivity which Mr Herzog referred to .
Reducing government debt must continue to be our top priority .
We also need , however , targeted investments in information networks , technology and research and development .
What I am interested in is structural stability .
However , it is the opposite of this - namely poor practices - which my country is currently delivering .
Chancellor Schröder ' s days of talking it up and laughing it off are finally at an end !
Many items in the report attest to this .
We shall , of course , be voting against this report .
It is merely one of the many ways in which Gordon Brown succeeds in fiddling the figures .
This has already happened in Ireland and it could happen in the United Kingdom .
The Member States have improved budgetary consolidation though close cooperation .
All , apart from the United Kingdom , will have balanced their budgets by 2004 .
Basically , the Commission insists that progress must be made on both counts .
There are still a number of cases of excessively high debts .
It is essential to balance the books in the medium-term .
Mr Katiforis also refers to the need to have the Commission ' s documents available .
That is a long-standing debate .
I will now turn to Paragraph 9 , which deals with the Commission ' s macroeconomic forecasts .
Quite simply , all that happened in Ireland was that current regulations were applied .
These were the issues I wanted to bring to your attention .
Thank you again .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
The debate is closed .
Mr Harbour , the rapporteur , has the floor for seven minutes .
I hope that it will get the same level of support from the House today .
I know that a number of colleagues who will contribute here today are also actively involved in this programme .
Why do we use the word initiative in presenting this to you ?
What do we want to look at and how are we going to achieve it ?
But what is the contribution for Commission and publicly-funded research ?
It is clear why we should do it but what do we need to do in that context ?
Issues of security and data protection are clearly important .
They are becoming more and more important as our personal data are so easily and quickly circulated .
That technology is something that will give us a real competitive advantage .
Mr President , I should like to start by thanking Mr Harbour for his excellent report .
I am not just flattering him , I really mean it .
I should like to pick up on a few points addressed by Malcolm Harbour .
Malcolm Harbour mentioned this .
What does that mean , anticipating the future in the Internet sector ?
We shall need to invest much much more in this sector than we have done in the past .
I would urge the Commissioner to show more ambition in this area .
There is also a need for good quality content .
Once again , the lack of capital is a huge barrier , especially to innovation .
Moreover , Europe displays strong regional differences in the supply of capital .
Mr President , the government itself will also need to adjust to the information society .
People must be allowed to choose for themselves in matters of information .
This alone brings us up against the main obstacle to this free network , to free communication .
There has already been a great deal of talk here about consumer confidence .
However , I think that this expression alone is most telling .
There is one obstacle : monitoring is being driven further and further forward , including at European level .
At the same time , most measures are only able to frighten off the really stupid offenders .
The question of data protection is addressed in Articles 10 and 13 of the report .
I think privacy is important for all data .
However , any changes to our telecommunication infrastructures must be fair and balanced .
Mr President , the new Internet generation is making many interactive applications possible .
The Harbour report , however , is very technology-led .
The public task consists of more than providing infrastructure .
Secondly , legislation on safety and content is insufficiently highlighted .
The needs , conditions and infrastructure required must be identified for weak groups .
Specific groups can then receive additional support .
In a nutshell , the applications deserve more consideration than is evident in this report .
The House certainly appears to be fully in support .
Secondly , in paragraph 7 , we talk about it being technologically neutral .
We need to feed into that process and be flexible , but we also need to be active .
Finally , the key issues of universal access .
I also feel that account must be taken of this issue in the White Paper on European Governance .
Better coordination of the Commission ' s activities is needed , as Mrs Mann also mentioned .
One point always needs underlining .
We must ensure that the outlying places are brought into this .
Next Generation Internet , will be realised through developments in both technology and policy .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m.
It is a challenge born less out of crisis and more out of evolutionary progress " .
I believe that this work has been brought to a mutually satisfactory conclusion and I commend it .
In this instance , the euphemism ' creative accounting ' has been used in place of ' irregularities ' .
I now give the floor to Commissioner Bolkestein .
My message to you is therefore : go for it .
You want me to confine myself to today ' s topic .
I am in a generous mood , Commissioner , but go ahead .
May I reply as follows to the two interventions made , and in particular to the rapporteur .
As you may know , accounting is a European invention .
This is what accounting in the European Union should not become .
Indeed , accounting has evolved to reflect these changes in business practice .
In 1995 , the Commission started to be actively involved in the work of the International Accounting Standards Committee .
Why do we need that proposal at all ?
Accounting is a technical and perhaps even esoteric issue .
Nevertheless , it is important to highlight the most important elements of this proposal .
However , small companies can be excluded from this disclosure .
One of Parliament 's amendments seeks to include banks within the scope of the proposal .
The Commission supports this amendment from the point of view of a single EU market .
Banks and other companies compete for capital on the same capital market .
We want it to be up-to-date and forward-looking .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place in Strasbourg .
( The sitting was suspended at 10.50 a.m. and resumed at 11.00 a.m. )
Mr President , I wish to make a brief point of order .
( Applause from the left )
Mr Krivine , I have taken note of your important statement .
I rise on a point of order .
Mr Gawronski , we shall indeed investigate the content of that meeting .
This is an extremely important and serious issue .
This is completely unacceptable .
This is a diplomatic issue and one that must be raised urgently .
The matter shall be followed up thoroughly .
We have taken note of your statement .
Could you please pass this request on to the Presidency .
I would like a straightforward answer about the use of this Parliament 's facilities .
( The President declared the common position adopted )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Relating to Amendment No 4
This wording is more far-reaching .
Relating to Amendment No 14
At least , so you intimated .
It was a more restful dream than the previous one .
Thus , I could not fail to vote for the motion .
Failure on the part of Member States to fully conform to new guidelines and regulations must not be tolerated .
Member States have taken positive and expensive steps to deal with BSE .
Animals infected or at risk are now considerably reduced in numbers .
Cashman report ( A5-0318 / 2001 )
She said to me : " That is very interesting , but what is the Council ?
It is never mentioned on Italian television .
What is the Commission ?
It is never mentioned on Italian television .
I know what the Parliament is because you have become a Member of it . "
In other words , more or less everything can be classified as secret .
This suggests that the old-fashioned Commission is still characterised by bureaucracy and an unwillingness to change .
The Regulation states that the rules will be reviewed in January 2004 at the latest .
The ELDR Group will be pushing the issue further .
However , he is right to limit the grounds for exceptions to the bare minimum .
, in writing .
The best is the enemy of the good .
Article 255 of the Treaty does not require any more to be done .
Evans J report ( A5-0125 / 2001 )
I tried to ask him what he thought of the regulation .
This report raises certain questions .
There is no mention of harmonisation .
For all of these reasons , we oppose the text .
Swoboda report ( A5-0132 / 2001 )
" No , " I replied , " it does not mention them . "
Greater internal autonomy could be given to the regions which have an Albanian majority .
Albanians should also be given better access to public sector jobs , in which they are currently under-represented .
For these reasons , we will not be voting in favour of this report .
The European Union is claiming to be a factor for stabilisation in the former Yugoslavia .
This pretension is both dishonest and vain .
Consequently , we voted against the recommendation .
By granting this premature aid , we are inciting unintended state violence .
Cederschiöld report ( A5-0120 / 2001 )
Mr President , I am sure that I will always remember you for your kindness .
In other words , would it not be better for the euro to be the same on both sides ?
This is not the case at all .
Admittedly , these budgets would probably prove to be very high .
They would not satisfy the Maastricht criteria for public deficits .
This is a paradox about this operation which we have to accept .
This would clearly be a definitive operation .
There was no financial need for it .
( The speaker was cut short pursuant to Rule 137 ( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
The euro currency is already an international reserve and a transaction currency .
Cederschiöld report ( A5-0121 / 2001 )
Let us be clear about one thing .
The long-term effects of the use of ecstasy are still very much unknown .
The trade in synthetic drugs is often a case of organised crime .
Enough reason to fight it and to coordinate and intensify the investigation activities at European level .
That is why the Group of the European Socialists has voted for Mrs Cederschiöld ' s report .
However , a number of members of my Group were less satisfied with the underlying Swedish initiative proposal .
It recommends a long-term policy which specifically includes energy savings and the use of renewable energy sources .
It questions the reliability of the ' risk model ' used by the official agencies .
These measures are all in the right direction .
Even today , however , the European authorities have not really learnt the lessons from this disaster .
The resolution itself does no more than recommend the closure of ' at risk ' nuclear power stations .
The causes of the accident , however , were not primarily technological ones .
Doyle report ( A5-0119 / 2001 )
" But this steak smells like medicine ! " I said to her .
" Yes , but the meat tastes awful , " I said .
" Couldn 't we stipulate that animals which fall ill have to be treated but not eaten ? "
Katiforis report ( A5-0127 / 2001 )
Mr President , the Christian Social Union supported the Katiforis report in the final vote .
I should , however , just like to point out that we voted against item 4 .
I have therefore voted against this report .
We shall be voting against the Katiforis report , every point of which we disapprove of .
Harbour report ( A5-0116 / 2001 )
However , half way through the meeting , Mr President , Mr Mauro used an example .
He said : " You see , the Internet is a tool , not an end in itself .
For example , here is a glass . Can you see this glass ?
It is to be used for drinking .
He used this example to explain that the Internet must be used properly , not abused .
The rapporteur often forgets that these new technologies must exist , first and foremost , to serve the public .
I am delighted that the Harbour report takes up these two points again .
Unfortunately , my amendments on this subject were rejected , largely at the behest of Mr Harbour !
The great caution needed is clear .
That concludes Parliament ' s agenda .
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
( The sitting was closed at 11.50 a.m. )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 3 May 2001 .
Statement by the President
I have also assured the Spanish authorities of our support .
I can only hope , now , that this message will be heard by all the political powers .
I shall now ask you , please , to observe a minute ' s silence .
( The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence )
As far as Monday , Tuesday and Wednesday are concerned , no amendments have been proposed .
As far as Thursday is concerned :
This amendment was tabled by the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance .
In that case we can deal now with the serious situation regarding the floods in France .
We therefore agree with the substitution proposal .
I think , in fact , that we can assume that things will move in that direction .
( Parliament gave its assent )
The agenda is thus adopted .
Speeches on procedure
Madam President , I have a point of order concerning the death penalty in the United States .
Thank you , Mr Ford .
Madam President , you mentioned the elections in the Basque Autonomous Community .
The Spanish Reconquista of the Basque Autonomous Community has not succeeded .
We , Euskal Herritarrok , have paid for that .
It is therefore not astonishing , if we appear as losers .
They have not achieved their goal of ousting Basque nationalists from the autonomous government .
The election results give us a clear message .
Thank you very much , Madam President .
Thank you , Mr Obiols i Germà .
Madam President . I wish to congratulate Mr Berlusconi on his splendid victory in the Italian elections .
The Commission has still not replied .
Thank you , Mr Alavanos .
You can count on me to do that .
There is one essential point .
You will remember , ladies and gentlemen , that this was what we were waiting for .
That is the position .
I think that would lead us away from the matter in hand .
I believe that matters are clear at the moment .
Moreover , for many of us they have always been clear .
They have been the subject of a certain amount of controversial debate , which I personally regret .
Have you been informed that the dossier is being sent to you again ?
Yes or no ?
Will you be doing that directly , or will you be informing Parliament first ?
There are , after all , two cases here .
Thank you , Mr Schulz .
The answer is no .
So far , I have received nothing .
That is the position , and I think I have made it very clear .
Do you mean the letters from the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ?
By all means , in fact I thought that they had already reached you .
Of course , we shall see to it immediately .
I am sure that Parliament ' s steadfast and almost unanimous decision helped to bring about his release .
I should like to thank all my fellow Members for voting in favour of this resolution .
Thank you , Mr Katiforis .
Manufacture , presentation and sale of tobacco products
No , of course not .
In that sense things have been brought into line with the judgment of the Court .
We have reached agreement on the publication of ingredients and on the common list of ingredients .
An extraordinarily important and pioneering provision .
It is also important from the point of view of a possible future assessment of less harmful tobacco products .
This topic will definitely be a political challenge to us all .
We have reached agreement on warnings .
Then there is the matter of misleading descriptions .
I should like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the Council .
I also believe that the participation of non-governmental organisations and of industry was positive .
They were able to achieve a lot with their contribution .
It was a remarkable conciliation .
I have three concluding observations .
I should like to mention the rapid decision-making .
In scarcely a year we managed to get this controversial and complex legislation carefully onto the statute book .
Where are those slowly grinding Brussels and Strasbourg wheels that are always talked about ?
We have discussed it on a number of occasions .
Jobs are also at stake .
I hope that we can really achieve reciprocal recognition of testing methods .
Exports to third countries are a sore point .
I deplore the fact that this may have adverse consequences for employment in certain countries .
For that reason I am for the time being reasonably optimistic .
I also believe that we have reached a reasonable compromise on transition deadlines .
In conclusion two more general observations .
The first is on young people and smoking .
That is not universal .
A second observation concerns the subsidies on tobacco .
It is my view that these should be gradually phased out .
Madam President , we have reached the final stage of this major directive .
We advocated the latter approach , and the text adopted in conciliation takes this line .
The second key point concerns the definitive regulation of the substances added to tobacco products .
These are not minor measures .
Surely it is axiomatic that rapporteurs do their work well ?
However , I should like to make an exception for Mr Maaten .
That is of course also dependent on the Commission and the Council .
I wish that were the case on more matters .
Now to come to the point .
Still , there are differences .
That was where you had to smoke , but it did not taste good at all .
Smoking was completely forbidden in the meeting room itself .
The number of non-smoking train compartments must be increased everywhere .
More and more we insist on using and meeting in non-smoking areas .
I experienced first hand that giving up smoking is a lot more difficult than starting .
Smoking also leads to substantially increased health care costs in many countries .
We see the results in these areas as major progress .
This will have to be a future task .
There is at least one commitment in this direction for the future .
Possibly EUR 1 billion per year is still spent on subsidies for tobacco cultivation .
The final text which we will vote on tomorrow is to be welcomed as the fruit of successful negotiation .
Cigarette smoking is the cause of fatal diseases amongst a quarter of all smokers .
The new regulations being proposed will be a significant step forward .
Twenty-five per cent of all heart-related diseases are caused by smoking .
Smokers are less long-lived and their health is less good .
Smoking is therefore a serious threat to public health .
Reason enough to discourage smoking then .
However , many people already smoke .
Because of the addictive effect giving up proves very difficult .
Unfortunately it is still the case that many young people start smoking .
The directive at present being finalised is an adequate response to the above-mentioned problems .
The Swedish Presidency also ensured that this file was processed quickly , for which it earns my praise .
There were disappointed noises from the Council .
Obviously it had not been expected that Parliament would want to change so much in the common position .
Indeed , the Netherlands Minister of Health felt that the European Parliament was weakening the directive .
However , I believe that most amendments were an improvement of the common position .
Unfortunately , however , these texts from the Council were not changed .
Other unhealthy results of smoking included blackened smokers ' lungs and rotten teeth .
It is precisely the intention that confrontation should have a preventive effect .
I am therefore gratified that Council has adopted this idea from Parliament .
Although an outright ban on the adding of ammonia or ammonia compounds would have been preferable .
In actual fact , it is quite incredible that this method of production has been accepted until now .
It is good that we are going to do something about it .
This should have happened earlier , but it is good that there will now be rules .
I believe that these types of designation are very misleading and give a false impression .
They create a false sense of security among consumers .
Finally , I would like to mention exports .
We have had a discussion concerning what I will call export hypocrisy in this matter .
There will be a transitional scheme for these exports .
I do not think that this was necessary , but it was , of course , a political compromise .
This piece of legislation will have a dramatic impact .
Over half a million people in the EU die needlessly each year from smoking .
At the end of this month there is the World No Tobacco Day .
However the battle against big tobacco continues .
One life lost due to tobacco is one life too many .
The Commission was happy to accept many of these amendments .
This directive recasts several existing directives from the late 1980s .
These ceilings will directly attack the agents in cigarettes responsible for cancer , addiction and cardiovascular disease .
Importantly , these rules now apply to all imported products and to all products manufactured in the Community .
Thus , we will not export products , which are considered inappropriate for our citizens .
The same threats were also expressed when the original tobacco directives were adopted in the late 1980s .
They were not true then and they are not true now .
Manufacturers and importers will in future be obliged to declare these constituents .
We will then move towards preparing a legislative proposal when these data are provided .
This will be done before 31 December 2002 .
In the meantime , Member States remain free to protect their consumers .
This directive introduces a requirement not to use such misleading terms on tobacco products .
This will replace the directive annulled by the Court of Justice last October .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Tuesday , at noon .
We are not , in fact , playing with words here .
They have arisen in natural processes which really should not have taken place .
Hay should not be allowed to go mouldy , since this makes it downright dangerous .
We should endeavour to create legislation that is clear , consistent and easy to grasp .
I think that this is very important .
It is of crucial importance that we get a comprehensive control system throughout the Union .
The big problem comes with control and compliance .
Mrs Paulsen has at the end again made the reason for this clear .
Member States are obliged to inform the Commission immediately and in full of any case of contamination .
This will ensure that the Commission is able to act at once .
These were included in the common position .
This took account of the intensive debate in the European Parliament .
Mrs Paulsen has just referred to this .
The report was accepted unanimously by the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Consumer Policy .
If codecision is to have any meaning , that is a position we will maintain to the end .
They need to be tightened up quickly .
Precision is at the heart of what Mrs Paulsen has had to say to us today .
I have known and represented that place for 30 years .
Ten years ago you would never have heard these considerations .
The fact that they are now paramount argues the case for this report .
Thank you very much , Mr Whitehead .
I would ask you to give Mrs Roth-Behrendt our best wishes for a speedy recovery .
The purpose of my speech is mainly to state that we support the amendments the rapporteur has tabled .
They are most justified with regard to the users of animal feed , the farmers .
This is also only right .
One or two amendments likewise very aptly stress the importance of inspections .
Finally , I would like to make one point , Mr President .
The future Member States are predominantly agricultural countries .
Mr President , I join in the compliments to the rapporteur for her dedication .
As you know , the proposal was articulated on three main issues .
I am satisfied that this agrees with the most fundamental parts of the common position .
In principle , the Commission accepts the legitimate expectation of informing the European Parliament on the inspection results .
If that oral amendment is tabled , it will take the place of Amendment No 5 .
So be it , the Commission can accept that .
I am grateful for the constructive approach taken to this dossier by the European Parliament .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Tuesday , at noon .
Mobility in teaching and training
It also rejected anything related to researchers , which I understood .
This is why we have had to make a few amendments to the common position .
I have asked for some follow-up action from Member States .
I have looked at ways in which we can reduce the administrative costs of implementing this recommendation .
I am happy with this report .
It further strengthens the joint position and has also taken account of the conclusions of the Nice Summit .
That experience may lead to increased knowledge of various languages and cultures , even in European countries .
For that reason also it is a good and extremely important programme .
At the first reading a first initiative was taken towards measures that would remove these hindrances .
It was possible after all to further improve the text of the recommendation .
There is a mountain of red tape .
Finally , I welcome the Commission ' s intention to make such a recommendation for researchers .
This is a great day for education policy throughout Europe .
The Americans have a very high degree of mobility among students and among their workforce .
This is undoubtedly an area in which we can learn something from the United States .
In this connection , it might be asked whether the EU ' s education programmes are adequate .
We are on the right track with this proposal from Mr Evans .
We are still , however , far from our goal in everyday practice .
We must continue to dismantle all barriers to freedom of movement .
Mr President , mobility is one of the subjects that the Commission holds dear .
To be mobile is to get to know other people , to work better together having studied together .
The European Parliament has proved to be extremely cooperative .
This is actually a very small correction that in no way changes the content .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon .
New technologies in tomorrow 's education
on the one hand , on three reports :
and on the other hand , on the oral question
Firstly , the rapporteur , Mr Alavanos , has the floor .
In a sense , therefore , this Commission text has been overtaken by events .
Not technologies that individualise , isolate and alienate pupils .
If that was true for America then , it is certainly true for Europe now .
We should not forget that prime responsibility for education rests with students and scholars themselves .
The question we have to address is : what can Europe do ?
What can we add to the educational business ?
The prosperity of our Continent depends upon the level of education offered to our citizens .
The other reports we are debating this evening deal with the present and the future .
My report deals primarily with the past .
My report is : White Paper " Teaching and learning - Towards the learning society " .
It was rather enthusiastic , but vague in terms of the impact of certain actions .
What was the European added value ?
What results were achieved ?
And what lessons were learned for the future ?
There are some things that can and should be done at a European level .
Europe with its richness of linguistic diversity presents problems as well as strengths .
I would say : let us be realistic , rather than too idealistic .
Because in some Member States that is not yet a requirement .
I will not deal with that .
The single market requires a much more mobile workforce than we currently have .
Mobility in Europe is less than half that of the United States .
I would say , however , that it is not just the Commission that can do things .
Let me suggest one way in which this Parliament could help .
I suggest that we give some thought to turning this building into a European university .
Things cannot be allowed to continue that way !
This is an issue that affects all Europe ' s citizens .
If success is coming at this late stage , I am grateful .
It involves matters that can be tackled only in the context of subsidiarity .
Perhaps the Member States can learn from each other . There is no need to keep reinventing the wheel .
We cannot , however , do very much more in these fields .
These things cost money , however .
I am sure that the Commissioner will do that .
I also hope that we can work together on the things laid down in this working programme .
I shall limit myself to the recommendations contained in my written opinion .
Students deprived of such a preparation run the risk of exclusion from the development of the new economy .
We must therefore also aim for optimum use of government investment in the use of technology .
Finally knowledge of languages , one of the principal European aims .
In my opinion , I stated that I should like to go a step further .
Because quite a few Member States have more than one official language .
Belgium has three .
For this to be effective sufficient resources have to be made available .
So it can help break the cycle of poverty and unemployment .
Lastly , I wish to congratulate Mr Mauro on his excellent work .
Eighteen countries contributed their experience .
There is a digital discrepancy .
The ratio of women to men on the Internet is in the region of one to four .
We must , for example , abandon coeducation in some matters .
We must tread new paths here .
I think it is particularly important that we catch up with the Americans .
Here , too , we find that American women already have much greater access to the Internet .
In some fields they have actually overtaken men .
I think we still have a good chance of achieving something here with our action plan .
I shall reply later to the discussion on the reports .
Having said that , I should like to give a clear reply to the question raised by Mr Gargani .
In the final analysis , however , it was the Commission which prepared the work of the Council .
It received the documents afterwards , immediately afterwards .
This is why I think that in future we ought to operate slightly differently .
After all , ladies and gentlemen , we are aware of the time limits .
Each time , the Education Council will prepare for the summits .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to make four points .
Maximialists in the strategies and political ambitions they develop on paper .
These programmes have their purpose !
They have the financial resources for that and nothing else !
I hope we can go this way together .
They also make clear some of the issues which we now face in developing such systems .
If we do not do this , we cannot attain them : it is as simple as that .
We need to have a coherent understanding of what constitutes good and what constitutes bad practice .
We need to learn from best practice .
These reports also point to the development of educational content .
We need mobility .
Here , as elsewhere , new technology is one of the keys to unlock all of these solutions .
The three reports on e-Learning by Messrs Mauro , Perry and Alavanos are excellent .
I should therefore like to thank them warmly for the work that they have done .
It goes without saying that we must not limit ourselves to mainstream educational institutions .
I have made that observation on more than one occasion .
This is important for the internal market .
I understand , however , Commissioner , that you have meanwhile repented .
The previous speaker spoke a little while ago about lifelong learning .
I read a plea for calling it instead ' learning as you live ' .
In fact I prefer that .
For children it should be ' learning as you play ' .
There is no such thing as a statutory framework for ICT coordinators .
It seemed an excellent idea to put this to you .
I therefore feel that we should be given the facts : what is the position now ?
It is said that in Flanders there is a computer for one pupil in every ten .
Luckily , a wave of protest has risen up against this policy in numerous countries of the European Union .
We , as members of the Communist Party of Greece , shall do whatever we can to foster this .
However , certain programmes can only be carried out from above .
Since their powers are limited , the States cannot act beyond their own borders .
What is the issue ?
In Lisbon , we took a number of important decisions with a number of concrete objectives .
The question now whether or not we can realise those objectives ?
That is what today ' s debate is about .
Let me make two observations before I start , two things I find really regrettable .
I feel the lack of that debate .
This is understandable because of the timing .
The second point a great deal less understandable and I will return to it shortly .
We simply have nothing to say on the subject , have we ?
Let me return to a number of reports before us , very briefly .
Rightly , but we can nevertheless learn a great deal from it .
Mr Perry is absolutely right when he says that the Commission has not achieved its objectives .
Let us try to define what European value added is .
We are again on the eve of a debate on the future of Europe .
Certainly there is talk of the debate on ' demarcation of competence ' .
Definitely very actively in Belgium on the eve of the Laken Conference .
However , what is ' demarcation of competence ' ?
What is the debate when we are discussing education ?
It is about subsidiarity .
In my previous life , I worked for the Flemish Minister for Employment .
Well , in that Ministry , people toiled to implement the European employment guidelines .
To return to Bologna .
It is terribly embarrassing .
I have received piles of letters and e-mails .
If we are unable to make that link I believe we will be missing a chance .
E-Learning is becoming increasingly important .
Until now perhaps less weight has been given to it in relation to education .
It is , however , becoming increasingly apparent that our children 's future is indeed a digital future .
The training of teachers in this field is a top priority .
I fully support this .
This has been , and will be , an added problem for schools working within very tight budgets .
Let us reduce the gap between Europe and the United States .
Let us create an e-Europe which is accessible to all .
I think this debate shows that very well .
One thousand and ninety already have their own Internet sites .
I am pleased about that , but at the same time it is not enough .
Commissioner , I thank you for your persistence in this matter .
We are on the right road together .
The destination is known , but we still have a long way to go .
This brings me to a number of points in the debate .
Firstly , the concept of subsidiarity .
Education policy is therefore the key to the success of economic policy .
The next point is lifelong learning .
For that reason it is natural that education should play a prominent role in the Union ' s strategy .
The work is to continue .
A follow up report is to be presented at the European Council meeting in spring 2002 .
The Committee has been stressing the importance of a European debate on education for a long time now .
Mr President , in Europe today , education has increased in importance beyond all recognition .
I offer my support to the reports which have been submitted .
Mr President , much has been said , and indeed , much has been well said .
First of all I should like to thank Mr Perry for his report on the White Paper .
The White Paper dates from 1995 .
That is a long time ago .
There is a change taking place beneath the surface .
Look at the Netdays Europe initiative , look at the E-schools .
Of course , at the moment there are only a thousand of them .
There really ought to be five thousand , ten thousand , a hundred thousand .
I am well aware of this . These thousand schools , however , represent experience on the ground .
The e-Learning action plan is also helping to change things .
Lastly , we are now in the middle of European Year of Languages 2001 .
Those who are doing nothing about it are beginning to have a guilty conscience .
That , at least , is a start .
We must continue to nurture that guilty conscience .
Some Members have mentioned subsidiarity .
As far as I am concerned , the interpretation of subsidiarity is very clear .
This is a revolution !
Yet this is now being done .
As regards financial provisions , the White Paper does not contain any .
As far as second-chance schools are concerned , I had my doubts .
I went and had a look at them and I was most pleasantly surprised .
It really is extraordinary .
This assessment confirms the great success of the pilot project and the thirteen schools .
The views of the education ministers have been expressed in the demands they have addressed to the European Council .
However , this does not mean that we can assume that we have achieved everything already .
That is far from being the case .
Nevertheless , the machine is in motion and progress has been made .
In 1995 , all we had were grand ideas , but no practical action on the ground .
Now , we are making progress .
I should just like to say a word or two about Bologna .
Now we are waiting for the Prague ministerial conference , and then the Belgian Presidency will take over again .
It is not always necessary to wait for the Commission to draw up a report before you act .
Parliament has the right to take its own initiatives .
Use that power , so that we can hear your voice .
The first is the principle of access for everyone .
However , a computer in the classroom is not an end in itself .
A computer is only a machine , a tool .
In my opinion , therefore , we must never separate the tool from the person who is using it .
There are also those who have left school .
I believe that we need to take this into consideration .
We must also train our teachers .
We have discussed this issue a great deal in recent weeks .
Teachers are the key to the success of e-Learning .
It is essential to convince them that they can teach differently by using new technologies .
The ideal situation , of course , would be one in which there was symbiosis between the two .
These two types of knowledge , working together , could be highly effective .
This brings me to another subject .
They are put into practice in our regions , our towns and our villages .
Any contribution towards getting specific local projects off the ground will be welcome .
So you see , ladies and gentlemen , we are standing on the threshold of a great adventure .
So , dear colleagues , we have had the right idea for many years now .
There are a few small problems here and there .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
Ladies and gentlemen , the joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Tuesday , at noon .
( The sitting was closed at 8.43 p.m. )
Yet here they are in our own building .
Thank you , Mr Corbett .
I will indeed discuss this matter with Mr Solana .
I do not know whether she wishes to reply .
Not at this moment , it would seem .
Madam President , on a point of order .
I wish to draw attention to some other rather unwelcome visitors on our premises .
Apparently , the courtyard of the Parliament is a public space .
They had not informed Parliament that this demonstration was going to take place yesterday .
I agree with Mr Van Orden .
You replied that yes , of course , you would see to it immediately .
It is now Wednesday morning and I have still not received these documents .
That is quite unacceptable , Mr Caudron .
I shall check what has happened at once .
Believe me , I will look into this matter .
Madam President , I had the same observation as Mr Corbett .
We also received notification that a high-ranking Burmese delegation is in Brussels .
Madam President , some more points on the Berlusconi affair .
First a positive point .
But now a second matter , Madam President .
As you know , Berlusconi controls a large part of the Italian press .
I find this unacceptable .
Madam President , there is a limit to the patience even of calm , restrained people like myself .
Naturally I immediately offered this journalist all our sympathy , on behalf of the European Parliament .
Situation in the Middle East
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in the Middle East .
I give the floor to Mrs Lindh , President-in-Office of the Council .
Distrust between the parties is growing .
Violence is claiming more victims every day .
Innocent civilians have lost their lives , including many children .
The economic situation is also difficult .
In practice , the Authority is living on financial grants from Arab donors and the EU .
The daily lives of Israelis are becoming more and more difficult .
Israeli civilians and children are being killed .
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was elected on the promise of increasing security .
Quite simply , the security situation has got worse .
There is no long-term military solution .
The conflict will neither be won or lost .
The only solution to the conflict lies in negotiation .
Therefore the peace process must continue .
A crucial difficulty is the basic lack of trust between the parties .
A diplomatic initiative is required to break the deadlock .
Measures to build trust are required if negotiations are to succeed .
Both the Egyptian-Jordanian initiative and the Mitchell Report demand a freeze on all settlements .
The EU considers that these requirements are justified .
The EU has encouraged Israel to start to withdraw from its settlements .
Considerable progress has been achieved in negotiations between Israel and Syria .
One condition for positive development in the region is the cessation of the current conflict .
Thank you , Mr Patten .
In general , the Arab countries are becoming ever more demoralised and positions are hardening .
Nonetheless , neither the Community nor anyone else can replace the will of the parties concerned to negotiate .
It is my heartfelt desire that this should come about at the earliest opportunity .
But Israel , like any other country , must recognise its international frontiers .
That , however , is not the case .
The entire territory of Israel ?
What territory ?
Faced with fait accompli after fait accompli , the international community stands by and does nothing .
Last Saturday , Israeli shells once again fell on a Palestinian refugee camp .
On Sunday , the army killed five Palestinian policemen whom it regarded as suspects .
And so the list goes on .
Enough is enough , Mr Sharon .
( Applause from the left )
Let me make the position of my group on this matter quite clear .
The rejection of the Mitchell Report is a lost opportunity for the Israeli government .
Will it be business as usual for products from Israel itself ?
Not in the view of my group .
The Palestinians are waging a war that they cannot win .
We have been saying for too long that we must stop the cycle of violence .
What , then , is our policy ?
This would be a positive message to the Palestinians , the Arabs and the international community .
There are no military solutions .
Commissioner Patten has made this very clear , as has Mrs van der Laan .
I condemn without reservation violence from whatever quarter .
A peaceful solution in the Middle East can be achieved .
In the overall context , securing peace in the Middle East is going to take time .
The permanent status negotiations resumed in September 1999 .
How can this spiral of violence in the Middle East be averted ?
What exact contribution can the Member States of the European Union make ?
Mr Sharon characterised it as ' unbalanced ' .
This judgement , though , did not apply to the Netherlands , the premier added .
In addition Mr Van Aartsen points to the dangerous radicalisation of the Palestinian camp .
And in that case what political prospects will there be for peaceful relations between Israel and Palestine ?
At any rate they can count on the support of the Israeli vice-premier Nathan Sharansky .
Surely that Jewish dream demands a European effort too ?
In this morning 's debate in this Chamber , we are repeating all the same things all over again .
It is no coincidence that Jesus Christ was born in Palestine .
What was then a Utopian ideal is now political reality .
But where are today ' s European Kreiskys ?
No one can seriously ignore Israel ' s desire for peace .
The present catastrophic situation is the result .
Our opinions must take second place if we want to be taken seriously as peace brokers .
I arrived back in Strasbourg last night directly from visiting Israel .
My statements are perhaps coloured somewhat by my private connections .
But you can rest assured that this nation wants peace on both sides .
It is part of our job to engage in talks with both sides .
It does not always have to be the politicians currently in office .
The vote will take place on Thursday .
I feel that Parliament 's role is coming into its own in this case as well .
This makes no sense . It is appalling .
We call for this to be done in Gothenburg .
What Mr Salafranca said makes sense .
If the violence does not cease , we will have to do something to assist the process from outside .
I believe that both parties will have to make great efforts to achieve this .
In addition , we must insist on mutual respect and good will .
Of course , many unsolved problems and unanswered questions will remain .
That is why we should envisage imposing sanctions on Israel .
We have now destroyed it .
I am surprised at such forgetfulness .
The policy proposed by Mrs Lindh , MEPs and the Commission is a formulaic policy .
We should take a more objective view .
Madam President , the European Union is expected to do something in the Middle East .
Now it must play an even more active part .
So what can we do ?
Let me also say that the Palestinians have the right to a state .
Europe can and must make its contribution and set out a balanced and active position to that end .
I have found such a position set out in the statements by the Council and the Commission .
Madam President , Israel and Palestine are two independent nations but they are not yet two independent states .
Sadly , there is provocation by people who should be showing leadership .
Of course I understand Israel 's nervousness about taking the first steps .
Israeli withdrawal was met responsibly by the Lebanese .
Madam President , I would like to thank you all for an excellent debate .
I also think this unanimity can be seen in this context too .
Mr Lagendijk said that it is unacceptable for resistance fighters on the Palestinian side to be executed by Israelis .
We have brought this up several times with the Israeli government .
Mr Sharon must acknowledge his political responsibility .
So what can the EU do further ?
Just as Mr Napolitano said , it is important that we also act .
We also support the Jordanian-Egyptian initiative .
It is of major international interest .
What I would like to do is rehearse exactly what has happened so far .
A great deal has happened since then .
On 16 December 1999 the Commission informed COREPER on the outcome of these meetings .
In early 2000 concrete information on specific imports from Israeli settlements was supplied to the Commission .
After this meeting Member States returned around 2000 EUR1 certificates to Israel for verification .
That is all the information that I have at hand on the history of rules of origin .
That is not what is meant by a balanced approach .
I happen to think that the Mitchell Commission report was an extremely balanced and sensible document .
That is a sensible , balanced approach .
To go beyond that would risk putting us on a very slippery slope indeed .
I thank Mr Patten for his replies to Members .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday .
State of the transatlantic dialogue
Transatlantic relations are good .
In 1995 , we also adopted the New Transatlantic Agenda .
We have also worked together within the framework of the EU ' s Northern Dimension initiative .
We have worked together on issues related to the new economy .
We have worked together on the fight against HIV / Aids and other infectious diseases in Africa .
The theoretical solution to the banana dispute that was recently achieved is one example of this .
However , as I said , there are also differences of opinion .
The EU ' s reaction to the actions of the US has been swift and powerful .
In these talks , it emerged that the US does not question the problem of climate change .
The US admits the importance of finding global solutions to the problem .
However , without the participation of the US , the Protocol will be considerably weaker .
Links between the EU and the US are vitally important in today ' s world .
Mr President , I now look forward to hearing the opinions of the Members of the European Parliament .
So where are we today ?
Secondly , the communication contains ideas on how to make the process more effective .
In view of these aspects , my group considers this communication a disappointing one .
It is more a stocktaking exercise than one that will encourage a broader transatlantic partnership .
How do you prioritise the agenda if you have already set eight strategic themes ?
The communication refers to an Interparliamentary Assembly .
That is not what it is .
It is a delegation which has converted itself into the Transatlantic Legislators ' Dialogue .
So we need broader thinking to develop the transatlantic partnership before 2004 .
First , we should stake out the ground for a broader transatlantic partnership .
Why not make sure we can re-energise the transatlantic business dialogue ?
It is in some difficulty .
I want to speak a little about what our role as parliamentarians should be .
We need to do a lot more work on that .
In that sense , I would like to pledge my group and my time to working on that .
Is it soft law or hard law ?
Self-regulation or co-regulation ?
In my opinion , we could even speak of a sort of crisis .
This is my free interpretation of the matter at least .
I would finally like to say a few words about security policy .
First there is the legacy of the Clinton era .
In view of this escalation , are we condemned to pro forma protests before settling for realism ?
I think not .
Mr President , dark clouds are gathering over the Atlantic and they are storm clouds .
I am thinking here of the Kyoto agreements .
I would like to quote from a Commission document about how to avoid or minimise new trade disputes .
That might be a lofty target but one worth aiming for .
He is absolutely right .
To be European is also to encompass a generous inclusivity about people 's notions very different from our own .
So I welcome the strong language in our compromise resolution on this .
But we need more than words .
But it is not just Kyoto .
Asking the US to consult before proceeding is not enough .
We should take up this offer by the US Administration .
It is of fundamental importance that we should oppose the arms race .
We want multilateral cooperation and agreements , and support for a reformed UN .
We want Europe and America to work together to that end .
The best security shield is the battle against poverty .
That is the route we should like to take .
Mr President , the EU-US partnership is of crucial importance .
If I combine both things , it may be possible to reach new agreements with the US .
Whether an agreement is called Kyoto or New York is a matter of supreme indifference to us .
But we must get down to work together .
My final point concerns parliamentary relations .
For some years , we have been enjoying better relations .
The Legislators Dialogue has gained momentum and has begun to bear fruit .
The collective memory on the US side appears to have been erased .
We are starting completely from scratch .
It is still too early to express real concern .
See my observation as part of a European " early warning " system .
A light is on , but it is not yet red .
Mr President , I will focus on the single area of environmental issues .
The question is how we react .
Should our reaction lead to a strong anti-American position ?
That must be our position .
We must fight together for greater environmental protection and greater safety .
Mr President , I think that our debate on the transatlantic dialogue has come at a very good moment .
Today we must at all costs protect this achievement of the transatlantic dialogue .
The concept of an ally must not be a one-way road .
The issue here is neither competition nor disengagement , but simply a united approach .
Discussions on US missile defence should continue .
I wish Parliament success in this area .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon .
There are two amendments that we are concerned about regarding port state control .
Mr Watts has requested the floor .
But I seek clarification on Amendment No 1 .
It is an important clarification .
I would appreciate a statement from the Commissioner on that particular point .
( The President declared the amended common position approved )
In brief , we accept Amendments Nos 2 , 5 and 6 .
( The President declared the amended common position approved )
[ COM ( 2000 ) 751 - C5-0638 / 2000 - 2000 / 0297 ( COD ) ]
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Voting time will be suspended now and resumed after the formal sitting .
( The sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and resumed at 12.35 p.m. )
No , Mrs Doyle , it is not the last vote this morning .
But that does not matter now and they are welcome to join us again .
Before the vote on block 1 by Mr Posselt and others :
Before the vote on block 2 by the Technical Group of Independent Members :
Madam President , whenever amendments are tabled , the name of the author is given .
Thank you for that clarification .
After the vote :
I think that that would be consistent with the democracy we practise in this Chamber .
Thank you , Mrs Thorning-Schmidt .
The Conference of Presidents will act as it sees fit .
I now have to join the President of Slovakia .
The voting , however , will continue .

Having said that , these proposals are inadequate , cynical and hypocritical .
Ludford recommendation ( B5 ­ 340 / 2001 )
Area of freedom , security and justice ( B5-339 / 2001 )
But there is , indeed , ' no room for complacency ' in Europe .
The centuries of slavery and colonisation weigh heavy in the history of the member countries .
We have expressed our views on this before .
The criminalisation of immigrants is a real scandal against people who are fleeing from political or economic oppression .
Those are a few of the measures with which we can fight racism and xenophobia effectively .
This is why the European Union must set an example .
In particular , direct decision-making power should be returned to the national parliaments .
As for national policies , instead of becoming more flexible they are more and more restrictive .
But not people .
Obviously , we voted against this motion for a resolution .
- ( SV ) I have voted against the motion for a resolution .
González Álvarez report ( A5-0133 / 2001 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
Is Mr Fatuzzo there ? "
" Speaking , " I replied .
" What about ? " I asked him .
We consider them dangerous because they are sexy , provocative and fascinating . "
Please help us ! "
The responsible parliamentary committee therefore decided , justifiably , to table them again .
Additional provisions to encourage producers and distributors to become more involved in the voluntary sector .
These proposals go in the right direction .
It is vital to the sound operation of the single market .
Amending this directive is , therefore , a step in the right direction .
We should , therefore , reinstate the European Commission ' s original proposal .
Lastly , another important issue is safety in the field of services .
We in the European Parliament are addressing this concern in a sensible , common-sense manner .
There were fears that the British tradition of charity shops would be threatened by these proposals .
We must not allow hidden dangers to consumers to creep in unseen through the back door .
Watts report ( A5-0140 / 2001 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
We have to work during the day and at night and we are poorly paid .
The Danish Social Democrats have voted in favour of improved European rules governing safety at sea .
Many accidents involving pollution could have been avoided by means of better safety .
We have seen all too many accidents in the last couple of years .
Most recently , we have seen an extensive oil spill in the Baltic .
The oil spill in the Baltic could have been avoided . Better European rules were needed .
The ship owners do not think that a black box has anything to do with safety .
However , that is not the case .
If we become better at discovering the causes of accidents , we also become better at preventing them .
We cannot wait for international rules in the IMO .
The EU must take the lead in the IMO by adopting better rules .
We cannot compromise on safety .
Rapid and complete compensation of the victims .
Eighteen months later , what has become of the measures we called for ?
We also note with interest the progress of the ' Erika II package ' , which we await impatiently .
Ortuondo Larrea report ( A5-0144 / 2001 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
At last , I understand what is going on !
Now I understand !
Today we are voting , at second reading , on the Ortuondo Larrea report on classification societies .
We cannot accept some others , which seek to reduce the financial liabilities .
van Dam report ( A5-0151 / 2001 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
I hope that Mr van Dam 's report will receive just as much support .
The single market liberalised the carriage of goods by road .
It is mainly for these reasons that we are voting for this report .
Calendar of part-sessions
We hope that our decision will be seen as a pragmatic and not a moral one .
Stihler report ( A5- 150 / 2001 )
Madam President , this was an extremely important report .
The alcohol industry portrays alcohol as something that is necessary to enjoy life .
It portrays the abuse of alcohol as something that is acceptable in society .
We have to address this issue .
One of the best ways of addressing this is by looking at the advertising industry .
There is something seriously wrong here .
Yes , smoking damages health and causes major problems for the smoker and for passive smokers .
It is completely unacceptable .
We need to address this .
We need proper restrictions on the advertising of alcohol .
It is a drug and should be accepted and recognised as such .
Who would not do so ?
The rapporteur is therefore quite right to raise these major issues .
- ( SV ) We believe that the focus of alcohol policy should be decided at national level .
The Stihler report addresses a recommendation from the Council in this area .
Therefore , we need to be very vigilant in face of the rising alcohol consumption by children and adolescents .
At the same time , we have to distinguish between different drinks .
That is why we certainly do not wish to condemn the producers .
Our aim is to put a stop to the excessive consumption of alcoholic drinks among young people .
Yet the producers do have a role to play .
They should not target their commercial and advertising campaigns specifically at adolescents .
That is why we will vote for Mrs Stihler ' s report and for most of her amendments .
Yes , we must protect the youth of Europe against alcoholism .
Swedish alcohol policy differs from that of many other EU Member States .
We want to retain this system .
Therefore , we are voting against this proposal .
For these reasons , I preferred to abstain .
Sturdy report ( A5-142 / 2001 )
Mr President , we are constantly calling for environmentally-friendly , ecological production methods in multipurpose agriculture .
However , the European Union still needs to be prepared for any sudden crises in the future .
This problem has yet to be resolved .
Mr President , the matter at hand is the measures adopted as a result of the fight against BSE .
Isn 't BSE a good thing !
Maybe we will not all have to end our days as beef steaks ! "
" I do hope not , " replied the other cow .
I also hope that this will not happen .
I therefore voted for the motion .
We have also voted against Parliament ' s report .
Both proposals are along the wrong lines .
We have therefore voted against all amendments aimed at increasing aid .
Instead , the proposal will introduce still more bureaucratic and expensive premium schemes .
The crisis is therefore a good reason for embarking upon a fundamental reform of agricultural policy .
Intensive breeding and the massive use of animal and bone meal led to the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy .
Portuguese producers are still suffering from the ban on beef and veal exports .
For all of these reasons , we did not vote in favour of this report and chose to abstain .
The European Commission is still clearing up after BSE .
The supply of beef would thus be limited in order to adapt to the drop in demand .
Every Member State will set an individual ceiling for each of its farmers .
I have voted against the Sturdy proposal .
Problems are moved to new areas or are not addressed at all .
The Doha summit is approaching and is due to take place in November 2001 .
Who , apart from Europe then , can give in ?
And this is exactly what is happening .
Between 2006 and 2009 , these three products will become entirely duty free .
The sector is therefore now experiencing the consequence of what we regard as the normal operation of market forces .
There is no reason for further increasing subsidies .
Langenhagen report ( A5-0129 / 2001 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
Why did I vote against the motion , Mr President ?
We should let every State catch its own fish !
Miranda report ( A5-0128 / 2001 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
It is precisely the treatment of rice in this report that concerns me .
And now , " Bon appétit , " Mr President .
I hope there will be a good risotto on the menu .
That is why we abstained .
That concludes voting time .

Situation of Turkish prisoners
This is a major human tragedy .
Discussions with the Turkish government are ongoing , particularly within the framework of our deeper political dialogue .
Meetings took place in Stockholm on 14 March and in Brussels on 26 April .
Their condition is worsening day by day .
The second law requires that a judge oversee the execution of sentences .
Suitable medical care must also be provided .
At the same time our Parliament does not want to intervene too hastily .
Turkey has been going through difficult times since the beginning of this year .
We are aware that this creates an extremely difficult situation for the Turkish authorities .
It is very much to be hoped that this humanitarian problem can be settled in the meantime .
I recently made a short visit to Turkey with Mr Cohn-Bendit .
We all know that reform is needed in the Turkish prisons .
The Commissioner announced a series of measures which Turkey intends to implement .
Solitary confinement must be the exception and not the norm .
Prison rules must be applied scrupulously and the arbitrary treatment of all prisoners must stop .
Mr President , allow me to start by making a basic observation .
We all know that .
Prisons are always the Achilles heel , the weak point of a democracy .
I think that , legally , this is the wrong approach .
The law is one thing and generosity is another .
That is the problem .
How to create trust ?
They are not making so many incredibly complicated demands .
Secondly , to instigate a dialogue with the prisoners so as to clarify exactly what they want .
It is important to recognise that .
The European Union must stop standing by in silence as more and more people die .
We must not be indifferent to the massive violations of human rights in Turkish prisons .
We must not forget human values .
The European Union must insist that human rights are respected .
The Turkish parliament recently passed a law relaxing conditions of solitary confinement .
My criticism of this law is that it does not allow all prisoners to take part in group activities .
All prisoners must be treated equally .
People in solitary confinement are totally cut off from the outside world .
And yet everyone needs human contact and interaction .
We urgently need to find a way of preventing further deaths .
My group cannot regulate Turkey 's internal affairs .
But we would all like to help put an end to this situation .
Human rights must apply to everyone , including prisoners .
That is why we must speak out .
In order to actually join , such a candidate must meet the Copenhagen criteria .
An important European demand in this connection is that there should be a constitutional state .
It led to a veritable deluge of complaints and even mass hunger strikes .
There they experience many difficulties .
Then in Western Turkey there are the Greek Orthodox Christians .
The Armenian Christian community particularly is constantly subject to new attacks .
The only crime was the selling of Bibles .
Anyone protesting is imprisoned and as a non-Muslim treated badly in the prisons .
Those people who have stayed are intimidated , imprisoned and badly treated .
Having said which , it is really very , very sad and disturbing to note that ...
Mr Ceyhun , it is fair to say you do not usually create so much excitement with your speeches .
Mr President , I shall not take advantage of the situation by taking up more time .
I assume that I have about half a minute left and shall wrap my speech up straight away .
Naturally , I regret this incident .
I shall say no more .
As far as the problem itself is concerned , this incident just goes to show how difficult things are .
And it is Turkey 's reputation that stands to suffer most .
These people could not have got in without being let in .
The fact that the Communists stood up when they came in shows where they came from .
Please look into this very carefully and check who signed the slip .
Well , the Members remained admirably calm when the demonstration was taking place .
Let us not have a row now .
We do not know how they got in but it will be fully investigated .
The President will , of course , be informed and an investigation will be held .
Unfortunately no action has yet been taken .
And rightly so .
It is a scandal .
Next time it will a president who is interrupted or attacked while making a speech .
I should like to know what that will do for the European Parliament 's reputation .
You must have misunderstood me , Mr Swoboda .
Of course , I take the incident extremely seriously .
The matter will be reported to the President , and the appropriate authorities will be asked to take action .
There is , however , one problem .
We have about 15 posts blocked .
I think it shows great , constructive involvement in the situation in Turkey .
I believe that the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission must continue their joint efforts .
On behalf of the Council , I would like to thank you for this work .
I therefore look forward to continued close dialogue with Parliament .
The Council will continue to present itself very clearly to the Turkish government .
The debate is closed .
Situation in FYROM
At local level , the EU Presidency set up close contacts with the key players .
Then , intensive shuttle diplomacy was also started .
Unfortunately , we have to say that the practical reforms have made slow progress .
Foreign Minister Mrs Lindh travelled straight from this House to Skopje .
We also believe that there is a vital role for Parliament and its party groups .
It is still possible to avoid all-out civil war in FYROM .
We must ensure that we make the most of this chance .
Macedonia is the first country in the region to sign such an agreement .
The second agreement with Croatia was initialled in Brussels last month .
The agreement makes it quite clear that Macedonia has European prospects .
These prospects now need to be given tangible form .
The EU shall continue to give its unrestricted support .
The European Union is already doing its best to facilitate this dialogue .
They themselves are responsible for the future of their country .
In all events , we shall promote continuing dialogue leading to tangible results .
The European Parliament has acted consistently since 1993 .
We have constantly discussed all the problems with our Macedonian counterparts and the Macedonian government .
For years little was done and that is a pity .
If the truth be told , this problem was criminally neglected for years .
And we simply have to concede that they have been imported from outside .
That is why we now need to look at the situation outside the country .
Elections were held in Kosovo last year .
But we have no proof of that .
It may well be a very good constitution .
It is just not on .
You have to learn from your mistakes .
Perhaps they should have asked their counterparts in the European Parliament .
We could have told them .
So I think that mistakes were made .
We must just hope that the elections can still be brought forward .
Now back to Macedonia .
In English it would be " Situation FYROM " .
It is the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
We hope that none of the parties will pursue separatist or nationalistic agendas .
So I think we are on the right course here .
I take up the Council 's suggestion .
We shall try to take a delegation to Skopje before the summer .
So what is to be done ?
Here again the primary concern must be qualification , with the ethnic principle coming second .
I think this is the right step to take .
In fact , just such an agreement has also been initialled with Croatia .
However , we must think one step ahead .
I think that the region as a whole needs to be able to feel at home in Europe .
What was done in Zagreb was a good thing .
I think that we must definitely view Macedonia as a potential member of the European Union .
Therefore those political criteria must be fulfilled .
Secondly , we as the European Union can do something ourselves .
That caused a row .
I do not assume that Macedonia can now be seen as a candidate .
It should merely be given a chance to attain this status through regular monitoring .
It is not just the responsibility of the Macedonians .
Thank you very much , Mr Katiforis .
The debate is closed .
Statute and financing of European political parties
( The sitting was adjourned for five minutes )
Thank you , Mr Ribeiro e Castro .
Does anyone wish to speak in favour of Mr Ribeiro e Castro ' s motion ?
Mr Dupuis has the floor .
Mr President , I fully agree with the motion tabled by Mr Ribeiro e Castro .
Mr President , the motion before us will sink our work without trace .
We need this debate now so that the Swedish Presidency can bring this matter to a close .
So I am most decidedly against this motion .
I am also sorry to have to say as much to my friend and colleague Mr Dupuis .
May I ask you in a spirit of friendship , Mr Dupuis , perhaps to reconsider .
Mr President , we debated this matter in committee .
It has been discussed .
Whether we want to or not is a political decision .
The committee decided by a large majority that it would take this article as a basis .
We have been asked to check that we have a quorum .
Mr Poettering has the floor .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would imagine that certain honourable members are delighted .
It is a most interesting coalition which we have here .
I hope that you will always feel at home in this alliance .
Mr President , I simply wish to make a point of order .
Mr Dupuis has the floor on a point of order .
I would , however , like to warn Mr Duff about the work of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs .
I think and fear that this is the case with the study we are looking at today .
My view is that we should remove party financing as soon as possible from that twilight zone .
That is also in the interest of European citizens .
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs will , therefore , have to meet and discuss the matter again .
That too is a democratic right enjoyed by parliamentarians here .
We do not wish to do this .
We cannot collaborate in this .
We must discuss this matter again as soon as possible and then adopt a motion .
We have therefore acted totally conscientiously .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I shall limit myself to making a point of order .
That is my first point .
We would be creating a monster .
It is in this sense that I protest because my democratic rights have been undermined .
We can see that the trick worked and that it is perhaps for the best .
We are now being asked to allow a short delay , in order to improve it further .
There is certainly room for improvement and I think that some good can come out of this .
Thank you , Mr President , for not having overlooked me this time .
I should like to say three things .
That is a problem .
Parties should be bottom-up and not top-down organisations .
Combating social exclusion
As we all know , the common objectives that must be set out in the national action plans are :
to facilitate participation in employment and access to all resources , rights and services ;
to prevent risks of exclusion ;
to work on behalf of the most vulnerable members of society ;
to rally all the parties involved .
I refer here in particular to my own country , Greece .
But I really must say that the Council has taken precious little notice of us .
Only a few formal matters have been adopted .
That is , I believe , unacceptable .
Our amendments are an attempt to change that just a little .
The common position that we have been examining incorporates 25 of these amendments .
The following amendments cannot be accepted .
So it is obvious that these are national efforts and national targets .
I cannot accept at this stage an increase in the budget .
To summarise , the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2 , 4 , 6 and 11 .
I have a couple of questions for the Commissioner .
If I have understood correctly , she rejects any mention of the European Parliament in the programme .
Is that correct ?
Is that also correct ?
Of course , we can find other ways of cooperation .
I have already said that we can organise a round table .
As far as the budget is concerned , I insist on the original proposal of EUR 70m .
It is very difficult to change it .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Wednesday , at 12 noon .
Safe and sustainable pensions
It would be irresponsible of us to ignore the data on economic requirements .
No Biblical curse is about to befall us .
They are the reserves we have to mobilise .
Mr President , I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for a well-balanced report .
That is not how things stand , however .
The injustices which women suffer throughout their lives continue when they get older .
In the end this will also produce a fairer pension system .
There are two ways of approaching this .
It is essential to link the two .
That debate is also about solidarity and also the equality of men and women .
For us a number of principles are essential in this .
I should like to mention four .
Firstly , pension systems must be able combat poverty in an efficient way .
Secondly , reasonable pensions are of course more than the minimum necessary for survival .
Pensions based on savings must be an important part of pensions systems in the future .
It is only right and proper that we should each of us take responsibility for our own old age .
This cannot , of course , come as some sort of surprise .
Lastly , the report warns against any attempt to undermine public pay-as-you-go pension systems .
This is why our group recommends that we adopt this report , without undermining its current balance .
Much has been said about solidarity and security .
This is exactly what should be addressed with regard to pensions .
There is still great anxiety about the discussion on pensions .
My colleagues have expressed unease over certain crucial points .
What will happen to security ?
How will it affect women ?
However , this presupposes that people will manage to keep working up to the raised retirement age .
I believe this is unrealistic .
In the first case a gradual approach is essential .
Mr President , this is a very good report .
Today 's youngsters will need a pension in the future .
There are three messages or conclusions which could come out of this report .
The people of Europe need to be convinced that we shall pursue our options consistently .
Mr President , Mr Cercas Alonso has drafted a quite excellent report .
That is why both the Member States and the European Union need to act here .
The idea of an active old age has , basically , been accepted .
It refers to the numerous women on widow 's pensions with no source of income of their own .
We must reverse the trend whereby these widows ' pensions are being whittled away .
This is one very important matter addressed in the report .
As far as the future is concerned , the concept of open coordination is on the table .
We must also ensure that this has real meaning as far as pensions are concerned .
On the contrary , we need new forms of coordination and these need to be created .
I would also mention the idea of capital formation by employees .
I therefore call on the Council to reformulate its mandate for this committee .
Capitalisation must have clearly-defined borders and must be part of the solution , not part of the problem .
All these areas must be addressed together if pensions are to be secured in the long term .
A variety of measures is needed for this .
This reform is social and economic in nature .
Pensions are , first and foremost , a social issue , but with huge , serious economic implications .
An initial Commission communication was ordered following Lisbon and has been issued .
I would just point out that one basic guideline given to this committee concerns the gender dimension .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday , at 12 noon .
Question Time ( Council )
The next item is Questions to the Commission ( B5-0169 / 2001 ) .
Question No 1 by ( H-0323 / 01 ) :
With regard to sugar , full liberalisation of trade will apply from 1 July 2009 .
I note that we have once again made an exception .
I hope that the Council will continue to exert pressure for unanimity for reforms .
There are differences of opinion among Member States .
This is a sensitive issue for many Member States .
Question No 2 by ( H-0325 / 01 ) :
Belgium , in particular , has put forward proposals for ' developing ' the informal euro Council .
I would like to thank Mr Danielsson for his reply .
My second question concerns the future .
However , I can honestly say that things have not turned out that way .
Can we be absolutely sure about what will happen in the future ?
Question No 3 by ( H-0329 / 01 ) :
On the contrary , the threat of renewed armed conflict between the two parties is now greater than ever .
These weapons are now deployed at the border , along the so-called ' defence wall ' .
Can the Council confirm this information ?
Does it propose to intervene with the Member State in question ?
The Council has not discussed the particular matter brought up in the question .
Deplorably , it also demonstrates the support that the country is receiving within Europe .
This can only heighten the already tense atmosphere in the region .
I am thinking back to the German Presidency , which made a specific statement on Western Sahara .
As far as the Western Sahara conflict is concerned , it has gone on far too long .
I believe that we all currently feel great frustration over the lack of progress .
This is the stance the Council will continue to take .
Why should we limit ourselves to supporting James Baker and the United Nations ?
The Western Sahara conflict is extremely difficult and has a complicated background .
Secondly , continuing my straightforward train of thought , which code of conduct are we referring to ?
The code you mentioned might or might not exist .
I would be grateful if you could explain how you plan to support Mr Baker .
I cannot therefore comment on this .
Question No 4 by ( H-0330 / 01 ) :
The Council has had the opportunity to answer similar questions from the honourable Member on several occasions .
Therefore , the Council ' s stance ought to be well known .
Let me also point out that the battle against human trafficking is a priority issue .
The Council is not turning a blind eye .
As far as I know , there are no plans to make any changes to the regulation .
Question No 6 by ( H-0338 / 01 ) :
What stage has been reached in the further consideration of this document in the Council ?
Why has the Council not yet completed its consideration of this directive ?
The Council has also taken on board Parliament ' s declaration to a large extent .
We too have worked on this .
This part is also very important to economic operators and economic partners in the EU .
This directive has now been through conciliation , i.e. it has been adopted .
This directive says nothing about definitive licensing .
That needs to be decided in the release directive .
I totally share the honourable Member ' s view .
The Presidency ' s firm strategy is to try to get a decision on the issue .
As I said , we have until June to try to achieve this .
Question No 7 by ( H-0340 / 01 ) :
This promise was given to the Swedish people ahead of EU membership .
As President-in-Office of the Council , I can be very brief to start with .
Nor do we foresee any such harmonisation in the future .
Thank you for your answer .
I believe that a procedure such as Mr Sjöstedt describes is out of the question .
Secondly , Mr Sjöstedt refers to the loyalty principle .
This is not new .
I want to thank the Swedish Presidency , and I want to thank Mr Danielsson for his answer .
I nonetheless wish to ask a question .
The question put by Mr Sacrédeus is obviously of relevance .
It is perhaps even more relevant in a Swedish Parliament than in this illustrious European Parliament .
I have a lot of confidence in the Swedish authorities ' ability to make independent assessments of such issues .
I think the risk of self-censorship is very slight .
We have compulsory registers .
We have a requirement for rapid assessments to be made of whether or not documents can be released .
We have clearly defined provisions governing secrecy etc .
If not , when will it be in operation ?
In other words , when can I get my first document out of the Council ?
Question No 8 by ( H-0342 / 01 ) :
In other words , he threatens all and sundry .
What does the President-in-Office have to say about all this ?
This is not the first time we have been pestered in this way .
This is also a question of the security of the European institutions .
Does the Council have any plans to strengthen security in the European institutions ?
Rest assured that no effort is being spared in dealing with the matter .
The second supplementary question is by Mr Fatuzzo .
You have the floor .
Such monitoring is taking place .
Questions Nos 9 and 10 lapse .
In any case , Mr Alyssandrakis has the floor on a point of order .
However , we are allowed a supplementary question during Question Time .
There are many ways in which you may express your views in this House .
Question No 11 by ( H-0348 / 01 ) :
The precise arrangements for this have not yet been determined .
Thank you for that very full reply , Mr President-in-Office .
Will it be budgetised within the EU 's normal financial procedures ?
Question No 12 by ( H-0352 / 01 ) :
The verbal reactions of European leaders to the statements by Bush do not constitute a policy .
Is the possibility of economic sanctions under consideration ?
The Council still stands by its belief in the Kyoto Protocol and the Kyoto process .
The most important objective right now is to get the United States involved in the Kyoto process again .
Thank you , Mr President-in-Office .
Question No 13 by ( H-0353 / 01 ) :
What action has the Council taken in response to Parliament 's appeals ?
As from next year , Finland too will have such a national day .
It is , unfortunately , a sad fact that new technology is exploited by anti-democratic forces .
It is a very pressing issue that Mr Sacrédeus is addressing .
It has also been discussed in detail in the Council .
There are so many other dates .
Question No 14 by ( H-0356 / 01 ) :
What criteria did the Council use to justify this distinction ?
The Commission had proposed a TAC of only 11 000 tonnes for 2001 .
The Total Allowable Catch for hake is divided up into four administrative areas .
The distribution of quotas is based upon biological and scientific advice and not , therefore , upon socio-economic advice .
Question No 15 by ( H-0357 / 01 ) :
It is therefore up to the despatching Member State to determine and pay out the chairman ' s salary .
Thank you for your answer .
The matter is clear .
That was something you promised last time .
Do you intend to send out that information ?
I can assure the honourable Member that I have in any case signed the answer .
I hope that it is on its way .
As they deal with the same subject , Questions No 16 and 17 will be taken together .
Question No 16 by ( H-0359 / 01 ) :
What improvements are planned ?
Question No 17 by ( H-0377 / 01 ) :
These killings are continuing at a rate of about 200 a month .
The negotiators meet almost every month with a view to concluding the negotiations this year .
Much has been achieved .
We expressed our concern about disappearances , arbitrary arrests and torture .
The European Union is also providing aid to selected institutions with a view to strengthening civil society .
We are actually talking about an association agreement with that country .
Is the President-in-Office of the Council prepared to pass on this request ?
You yourself mentioned the Berbers .
There are many other groups which also need to be mentioned .
Let us therefore work together in order to achieve this .
That is why we want Association Agreements .
The Council believes that this is a more effective instrument than just letting things happen .
Question No 18 by ( H-0366 / 01 ) :
This is an important issue that the honourable Member has addressed .
I shall therefore give a relatively long answer , in spite of the lateness of the hour .
The Regulation came into force on 5 May 2001 .
The doubts related mainly to three particularly sensitive products : bananas , rice and sugar .
Where bananas were concerned , complete liberalisation was postponed until 2006 .
The Community has just given up the tariff .
Consequently , no protection of this sort will be available after 1 January 2006 .
I anticipate that the beneficiaries of this measure will be the large multinationals .
The Commission ' s assessment is that there will be minimal consequences in the medium term .
Thank you for being so very helpful this afternoon , Mr Danielsson .
We shall now invoke the Rules of Procedure .
Questions Nos 21 and 22 have been withdrawn .
That concludes Question Time .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
Aid scheme for olive oil
The next item is the combined debate on the following reports :
These plantations do not use terraces , which often creates slopes of more than 12 % .
Furthermore , this proposal is certain to have a beneficial impact on quality strategy .
Mr President , first of all I should like to thank the rapporteurs on these important issues .
The amendments tabled and approved are a step in this direction .
Here I shall ask the Commission a formal question .
With this resolution we are going to intervene in Regulation 1638 / 98 .
The Regulation expires on 31 October 2001 .
My question is this : what is the Commission going to do ?
We must reject this proposal .
Unfortunately the answers have never been reassuring , and sometimes they have been quite alarming .
I thank Mr Peres for the truly excellent results of his work .
I should like to cite two examples here .
The same applies to market balance .
In 1998 , the Commission established that there are 180 million olive trees .
That is a difference of 40 million trees , a discrepancy of about 31 % .
There was no obligation to keep records or ledgers of accounts payable .
As a result , there was a huge amount of fraud and irregularity .
Only 6 % has been recovered so far .
We really do have our work cut out here .
As far as export refunds are concerned , just 13 % of the money has been recovered .
Mr Casaca 's report shows us how .
Mr Casaca has dealt with the special report by the Court of Auditors .
Mr Jové Peres has led the debate on the Commission proposal .
First to Mr Casaca 's report .
However , I should like to take a more detailed position on two points .
However , come what may , we need a geographical information system .
Besides , the Court of Auditors ' proposals suggested other ways of making improvements here .
These doubts should come as no surprise .
They were expressed at every Council meeting between 1995 and 1998 .
I should like to comment on all four .
The outstanding problems are connected with marketing structures .
Amendments Nos 7 , 11 and 14 call for greater involvement of the Commission and additional research .
As a result , at least 30 % of mills must be controlled in situ .
In addition , the mills must send in data on their stock accounts at the end of every month .
The proposal for a computerised system for monitoring on a day-to-day basis is being examined .
If it proves to be sensible and practicable , the Commission could issue the corresponding regulation .
We therefore reject Amendments Nos 17 , 20 and 32 .
The Commission will , however , include your suggestions in subsequent Council discussions .
However , the details of possible measures must be decided by the Commission .
This is certainly a good idea .
Thank you very much , Commissioner for this very full answer .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Draft SAB 2 / 2001
That was the brief which we stood up for and which we negotiated .
That would have been too confusing .
My thanks to the honourable members from nearly all the groups for supporting me .
The chairman of the Committee on Budgets will cast our vote on this motion tomorrow .
Now it wants more money to spend on yet another ambitious and seriously misguided project .
Can we have an assurance that this total of 141 personnel will not be exceeded ?
That is a reality .
That is what it is all about .
It is very dangerous .
Tonight we are discussing an unnecessary EUR 10 million .
Now their project has run out of control .
We know who is to blame and we cannot support this budget .
I really expected nothing of the sort .
But nothing should come as a surprise in the European Parliament , especially not in this area .
At times we remember this and smile .
So support in principle is there .
All that does is to demonstrate that you do not want any parliamentary control or any parliamentary support .
Which is unacceptable .
That cannot be .
We shall , of course , bring our standpoint very clearly to bear in the overall debate .
Now is not the time to be petty .
Europe 's share of the common foreign and security policy is still very small .
We should not start by being petty .
That cannot be .
Mr President , first I would like to thank Mr Ferber for an excellent report .
One ' s attention is drawn the urgency of the situation .
Another problem is the overlapping of functions .
This overlapping must definitely be prevented .
Expenditure relating to the common security and defence policy falls within the competence of Parliament .
Mr President , I too must say that this is a most interesting debate .
On the contrary , we truly believe that Mr Ferber was a tough negotiator .
We have the greatest respect .
These are politically charged questions , as Mr Ferber has already made clear in his speech .
Here too we are of one opinion .
We have our doubts .
What is at stake here is the delicate balance of power between Parliament , the Commission and the Council .
There is also another point which must also be addressed .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , just two brief comments .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Commission presentation of the preliminary draft budget for 2002
By that I mean both new and traditional priorities .
No doubt the rapporteur , Costa Neves , will have something to say about this now .
Obviously , we too want a speedy and fair budgetary procedure without too much arm wrestling .
The Council needs to heed that more than in previous years .
That sounds solid enough .
At the same time , however , it is the penultimate budget of the Union of the Fifteen .
We need to bear that in mind at this point .
I just want to list a few points which will be important to us .
It is good that the Commission intends to do more about clearing the backlog of payments .
Commissioner Schreyer has just quoted a few figures here .
The actual figures will be available in the autumn .
It is good that the Commission has left room for manoeuvre in internal policy .
These are examples of where there is a real need for consultation .
That would be too little for me from a foreign policy point of view .
Commissioner , I should like to address one final point : administration .
I should like to remind you of this resolution .
To confirm our fears , the reduction of unpaid commitments ( RAL ) , will be in appearance only .
This would be the equivalent of rehashing the RAL and would not solve the problem .
It would be useful to have the precise figures as soon as possible .
The broad economic guidelines give 15 September as the date for this document to be presented .
The Letter of Amendment is another possibility to consider for the presentation of this document .
What will happen then ?
And what about the operational costs of our defence and security policy ?
It seems quite clear that the resources decided on in Berlin are insufficient .
We shall see .
Consensus with the Commission and the Council is both desirable and possible .
I would stress that this position complies with the broad economic guidelines .
I thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner .
Estimates of the European parliament for 2002
We shall shortly be receiving the three-year plan on administrative preparation .
Think , for example , of people required to set up a language regime .
Mr President , enlargement will increase pressure on the margin of the budget .
In addition accelerated financing leads to considerable savings in interest .
An interinstitutional working party was even set up .
But since it was not given the slightest priority , it was short-lived .
Equality of opportunity is still not a reality .
Enlargement : of course we must prepare for enlargement .
We face a huge challenge if we want to master all that .
Why are there no other options in situ ?
That is our job as representatives of the people .
That is best done locally .
The Commission is on the right track here .
But that is only the second cheapest solution .
We must be clear about that .
The cheapest solution would be to build ourselves .
We went through that in Brussels and we have been through it here .
We could show a bit more intelligence here .
That would be the cheapest solution .
This means that more posts are saved than new posts requested .
We still need an in-depth discussion of how this can be reconciled .
I am delighted that the rapporteur has also taken up our transport options .
I hope that we shall not have to cycle around Brussels .
I consider that far too dangerous .
Perhaps we can take the metro in Brussels .
That would take us one stage further .
But , as I say , bicycles in general are too dangerous in my book .
I hope that we can find a reasonable solution here .
However , the reform process embarked upon so far sometimes feels a bit slow .
As everyone agrees , this is essential because of the challenges presented by enlargement .
All of us know that enlargement will have far-reaching effects on all aspects of Parliament 's services .
We could need about 459 new offices in Brussels alone .
This will need considerable planning , with all the implications well thought through .
Therefore , Parliament 's three-year plan is essential to make enlargement successful .
It is critical that this plan should be considered and not rushed .
Where are the principles of budgetary rigour and efficiency which the PPE-DE Group often talks about ?
It is important that we review these issues , but not at this stage .
Madam President , I will try and keep to the timetable .
My sincerest thanks go to her accordingly .
The EU ' s forthcoming enlargement will make these especially necessary .
The other problem is buildings policy .
There must be an aim to rationalise the work of Parliament so that buildings expenditure can be cut .
Buying property is quite acceptable when money can be saved as a result .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
( The sitting was closed at 11 p.m. )
Address by Mr Schuster , President of the Slovak Republic
Under your Presidency , Mr Schuster , democracy has been established and consolidated in Slovakia .
I want your country to know that it has the support of the European Parliament .
Mr President , I shall now ask you to address our Parliament .
( Applause )
This is the first time that the Slovak language has been spoken at your plenary session .
It is therefore natural that we should link the future of Slovakia with Europe .
Europe that is unified and prosperous , peaceful and attractive .
Our common Europe .
You are performing your work for Europe in a truly momentous period .
We owe you our respect and gratitude for promoting this process .
The citizens of Slovakia will always bear this in mind .
The accession of the Slovak Republic to the European Union is among the key priorities of our foreign policy .
I can understand their concerns - they are natural and human .
At the same time I have the impression that these worries are often conjured up artificially .
It is not our wish to disturb what has been achieved in the integration process in past decades .
We have to jointly focus on two areas .
And we must work together to strengthen European solidarity and the feeling of togetherness .
Europe is not only a map .
The entry of each new country will enrich the common house by its spiritual , cultural and historical heritage .
This was not a good situation for Slovakia .
The next such meeting is to be held in a few days in Bratislava .
Today - after 17 months of negotiations - we note great progress .
The path of integration is interspersed with exceptionally lively political discussions and , sometimes , disputes .
I want to assure you that we have no shortage of this energy .
The year 2000 was the year of the " economy " .
Structural adjustment brought improvements in the effectiveness of the corporate sector .
This year , 2001 , is the year of " legislation " .
The amendment has put in place the legal prerequisites for the integration of Slovakia .
I fully agree with the individual approach and the assessment of the countries on their merits .
We all , both members and candidates for membership , want a stronger Europe .
We may agree with many , although not all the opinions .
Our objective must be to further build the European Union as a political community .
But the process must continue and the system must remain open .
An important part of the entire European integration process is the building of the European identity .
The Slovak Republic declares its willingness to share in this common responsibility .
Thank you for this opportunity of addressing you
( Loud and sustained applause )
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
In so doing I would point out that the Bureau is required to request the relevant transfer of appropriations .
That said , you raise the issue of yesterday ' s incident .
I can assure you that we take such incidents quite as seriously as they deserve .
The Quaestors have already met and looked into the matter .
That is one thing .
Everyone is well aware of that .
Of course , the Bureau is seeking the cooperation of the Committee on Budgets .
We hope we will be successful as soon as possible .
The two are wholly unconnected .
The people are there . We do not need any new posts .
Secondly , people are saying that the security guards posted at the entrances were responsible .
That does not have anything to do with the posts either .
What is important is that we improve security .
Mr Ferber is right there .
However , there is no direct link to yesterday 's incident .
( Applause )
It is an extremely serious and vitally important point , because security in this House is not good enough .
Thank you Mr Provan .
We will see if that is possible tomorrow morning .
I am joking .
That being so , on 30 May , we will look at the whole situation in all its aspects .
I do not think Mr Provan has understood my invitation .
Thank you very much indeed for that statement , Mr Wurtz .
The Spanish version , in any case , is incorrect .
I should like this to be recorded in the Minutes once again .
I did say it yesterday to your representative .
There must be no repeat of this !
I would really ask you to ensure that these matters are investigated .
Quite , Mrs Pack .
Madam President , I want to speak on the item ' statute and financing of European political parties ' .
I do not think the Minutes accurately reflect the point Mr Ribeiro e Castro raised yesterday .
It cannot therefore be put back on Parliament ' s agenda .
Is that what you said yesterday , Mr Berthu ?
Very well , we shall amend the Minutes so that your remarks are properly reported .
You have jumped ahead rather , but we are still on the Minutes .
That being the case , we will be able to save time later on .
The relevant provision was Rule 143 .
That is why there can be a vote straight away on whether we address this report or not .
I would like to make something clear .
During the sitting , three demonstrators carrying banners entered the Chamber .
That is what it says .
That was not the case .
Are there any other comments ?
Quite , Mr Barón Crespo .
We will make that change to the Minutes .
We will look into all that , of course .
( Parliament approved the Minutes )
Who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal ?
Madam President , I do not wish to repeat all that I have just said .
It is completely justified to make this proposal here in accordance with Rule 111 .
The people of Europe expect us to discharge our responsibility here .
( Loud applause )
Thank you , Mr Poettering .
Mr Dell 'Alba , you want to speak against this proposal .
Madam President , I cannot understand what Mr Poettering is talking about .
So I cannot understand the rush .
We are not going to do that twice in the same part-session and on the same subject .
That really is quibbling .
So let us be realistic , there is a mini-session soon .
Your services can , I think , wait a little while .
We have heard one speaker in favour and one speaker against .
Afterwards , Parliament will decide .
( Parliament gave its assent )
The report therefore becomes the first item on the agenda .
Status and financing of European political parties
Parties are the foundation stone of democracies .
Many people ask whether we need a statute for European parties .
The European Parliament is the only institution of the European Union which is legitimated by direct , free elections .
The European Parliament is also regarded as the cradle of European parties .
In this way , new international party structures and European parties gradually developed .
The party political landscape is hardly uncomplicated .
The number of parties represented in national parliaments varies considerably across the Member States .
Our 626 Members of the European Parliament , at any rate , hail from 130 different national parties .
This work cannot be done by a national party .
Up until now the European parties have been supported by their groups in the European Parliament .
How the funds are to be distributed is also laid down in the Regulation .
This goes further than existing national legislation on parties .
There are also precise rules on how the Regulation is to be implemented and on control .
The European parties are not permitted to use their funds to finance national parties .
This ban also applies to the funding of election campaigns .
I cannot recommend detailed rules at present .
I should very much like to hand it over to the President of Parliament .
I hereby hand this speech over to the President of Parliament .
How then is the will of the European people to be expressed , if not through parties ?
That is why we need to amend our Rules of Procedure .
I should also like to acknowledge explicitly the very great effort that the Swedish Presidency is putting into this .
We want more transparency . We want straightforward financial control , Commissioner Schreyer .
They had not secured a majority in the Committee on Budgetary Control and were attacking us .
That is completely inappropriate !
I should like to refer to one further point : legal personality for the parties .
Legal certainty is actually the most important thing in the European Union .
This peaceful conflict resolution is only possible on the basis of the law .
That is why it is important for there also to be recourse to the ECJ .
( Applause )
This is an open debate .
In many European countries we have had bitter experiences in this area .
The situation in which the groups are keeping the parties afloat .
There was no other way until now .
The Court of Auditors has highlighted this , which is to be applauded .
Needless to say , nothing has happened in secret .
It is patently clear that political parties must be able to lead an independent life .
We must never end up in a situation of that kind .
We need effectively functioning parties , as Mr Poettering and Mr Barón Crespo already stated very eloquently .
We need stability in our democracy with a view to enlargement .
The new countries which are about to join us are also politically active .
Only in that way can we in this Parliament help democracy develop in the future .
That is of key importance .
Furthermore , we need stability with a view to democratic development in the European Union .
Someone will then need to put forward these candidates .
For that too , a proper system will need to be developed to accommodate this .
In addition , it is necessary for those parties to be independent .
There is more to say on this subject .
We also agree that the system does not mean that pro-European campaigns are funded with this .
We should examine these aspects further .
For example , the aspect of support for political campaigns should be addressed .
It had to be done in the twilight zone .
It must be possible to form democratic parties without creating too high thresholds .
There should also be sufficient funding for all recognised parties to be able to function as a party .
I should like to ask Messrs Poettering and Barón Crespo to reconsider their words .
I do not think that this is the case .
Rather I think that parties often tend to take themselves particularly seriously .
Nevertheless they are still democrats .
That is why I support Mrs Schleicher 's report and would also thank the Commission for its initiative .
I would come back , however , to questions of principle , which I believe we should examine thoroughly .
We should like to know how Article 308 is to be implemented .
How can it be brought forward with regard to the Treaty of Nice ?
There has never been a reasoned response .
I should also like to take the opportunity to reply politely to Mr Poettering and Mr Barón Crespo .
We are not against Europe .
We are against the bulldozing of rights , especially in the case of fundamental rights in Europe .
Neither are we against political parties !
We are against illegal discrimination against parties .
I should also like to draw your attention to Article 191 .
It does not authorise any discrimination between them .
It deals with political parties at European level and , in a special declaration , rules out discrimination .
The Schleicher report would provide some parties with special aid not available to other parties .
This is contrary to the principle of equality .
It really is a Parliament of charlatans that has spoken this morning .
I think the Court of Justice in Luxembourg will find the matter ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr Dupuis , you too are part of this Parliament .
Please try to measure your words .
Mr President , for me our Parliament has been acting the clown .
I warn you , we are working on going to Luxembourg .
The discrimination issue is just as glaringly obvious .
That is a political judgment !
I have listened with interest to the Members , and without too many surprises .
However , what are political parties ?
Nobody wants to talk about this .
That is incredible !
It is the bureaucratisation not just of Europe but also of our society .
You have invented a new tax for the citizens , which forces them to finance your bureaucracies .
Mr Barón thinks that somebody here is against parties !
He wanted yesterday 's majority to prove themselves to be democrats if the tables were turned .
I can assure him that we are behaving like democrats .
It is precisely democrats , however , who are deeply concerned about the Rules of Procedure being complied with .
That is an exclusive rule .
This was in July 2000 .
Madam President , firstly I will refer to Mr Dupuis ' s speech .
We are well aware of what those who reject this financing mechanism are waiting for .
They still prefer the system where suitcases of banknotes are handed over in the dark .
It does not really ensure transparency .
The democratic threshold for accessing the financing is far too high .
That is called organised corruption .
In that case , however , we must demand that they clean up their acts .
It is an enormous problem we are creating .
We are hugely deepening the gulf between ourselves and the people .
This is completely clear following the Court of Justice ' s pronouncement of 28 March 1996 .
Today we find ourselves in precisely that scenario with the European political parties .
We are after all living in a multi-party democracy .
Parties are not an end in themselves .
It contributes to making the post-Nice process more democratic .
The real name for that is misappropriation of public funds .
Our view also is that the Schleicher report does not follow the principles of the Nice Declaration .
The Schleicher report quite clearly discriminates against some of the smaller parties and groups .
Firstly , warm thanks go to Mrs Schleicher for her excellent work .
As you know , we opted for a twin-track approach .
At the same time , we proposed interim rules on the basis of Article 308 .
This is a sound legal base for this proposal .
In its proposal the Commission tried to adhere to two principles .
The Commission has tried to reach a consensus and find a happy medium .
I wish to comment on the most important amendments before the House .
We share the view that there should be a reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
We also share the view that European political parties ought to have legal personality .
The right rules need to be found for this .
Would an adjustment have to be made each time ?
What does a quarter mean in respect of a figure of 21 or 23 Member States ?
This would mean that extra rules would constantly have to be dreamt up .
For this reason we explicitly propose the figure five .
We cannot accept Amendment No 22 on the period of validity of the Regulation .
Secondly , the Commission has considerable difficulties with Amendment No 21 on penalties .
We can accept the second sentence , " Monies wrongly received must be refunded . "
I would point out , however , that this is simply reiterating normal budget rules .
Funds are granted by the Commission in accordance with the usual rules .
Article 274 offers neither the Council nor Parliament the opportunity to intervene in the budget 's penal system .
However , I would refer once again to the associated risks .
Why this temporary status ?
Party financing is a politically sensitive issue .
It is in the interests of democracy and in the interests of democracy in the Community .
Thank you for the very full information you have been kind enough to give us , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
Firstly , the extended and clear-cut list of Eurojust 's areas of competence is very important .
Money launderers must feel just as vulnerable as polluters .
Secondly , we have added a recital on data protection .
Rules on data protection must also be observed unreservedly when personal data are exchanged .
Thirdly , we want to ensure that Eurojust is able to work as flexibly as it possibly can .
This is a fundamental prerequisite for success .
Direct and uncomplicated contact between those involved is particularly important .
This is a relatively short period of time if you compare progress in other areas of European policy .
In Parliament we have been very positive towards this rapid progress and have taken an active interest in it .
To compound matters there were communication problems because of the natural language barriers .
With Eurojust these obstacles should now be surmounted .
Eurojust has , first and foremost , a clearing function .
Alongside her amendments , there is one further amendment in particular to which I attach great importance .
Until now , the judicial network has been a body without a head .
This is one of the ideas which our proposals contain .
I should like to ask the Council to take account of these in its considerations .
Today we are discussing two important segments of judicial cooperation in criminal matters .
That also applies , for example , to the network of consumer ombudsmen .
We see that we can all cooperate .
We shall bring about practical results .
As previous speakers have pointed out , it is important that the rules relating to personal protection are respected .
It is extremely rare for prosecutors to deal with these crimes .
This gives rise to a few questions .
What protection will be provided for this information ?
Who can access and use it ?
What right of reply and defence , indeed of correction of incorrect or out-of-date data is there ?
That is the purpose of my amendments , on which our support for this report will depend .
The stakes are as high as they can be .
Eurojust is about giving Europol a real judicial partner .
So , what use is it to establish supranational structures ?
The people of the European Union must reverse this march and they will .
The European Union must no longer be a soft touch for serious crime .
Traditional enforcement measures are no longer enough .
It also extends to the laundering of proceeds of crime .
Today in Brussels the EU Forum on Organised Crime is holding its first meeting .
The Commission must keep us and the public informed of the results of such meetings .
Let us make it a general rule that all relevant EU policies will incorporate a crime prevention element .
Our group will be supporting this report .
I am told Saint-Just was a good lawyer too .
Eurojust raises many questions , so I am glad Commissioner Vitorino is here .
Nice clearly rejected the principle of an independent public prosecutor .
The countries do not want it , for all sorts of reasons .
The rules on that vary from one country to another .
I wonder where we will end up if these methods are exported to Europe .
For pity ' s sake , let us reject this ' Euro Saint-Just ' .
Where police cooperation is concerned we can say that substantial progress has been made .
We have Europol , and Europol is working extremely successfully to fight crime .
In principle , then , Eurojust works like Europol .
It coordinates the criminal prosecution authorities in the fight against organised crime .
I would congratulate the rapporteur .
There is only one point on which I disagree with her .
She has proposed that Luxembourg should be the seat .
The proposed college is an innovative instrument essential to the pursuit of these objectives .
The Tampere decisions are moving ahead , making their way .
Eurojust is to operate with appreciable independent status .
Fourthly and lastly , data protection .
We feel it would be preferable to speak of competence in matters of economic and financial crime .
One of the most sensitive questions is the relationship between Eurojust and OLAF .
Thus , we feel it is very important to specify their different scopes .
Not perfect , but an essential first step .
That is why I hope the House will support Mrs Gebhardt ' s report .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place in a moment .
Thank you very much Madam President .
I think their professionalism in the situation deserves much credit .
Thank you for that statement , Mr Martin , which we are very pleased to note .
Naturally we fear for the safety or even the lives of the hostages .
Mr Queiró , we have understood your message very well .
However , it is 12.20 p.m. and we have an enormous amount of votes .
All the same , we have certainly heard your message .
Before the vote on Amendment No 12 :
After the vote on Amendment No 54 :
It is a compromise amendment from the PSE , Liberal and Green Groups .
A new situation has arisen .
Now the parties are only required to be represented in a quarter of the Member States .
Before the vote on Amendment No 46 :
For that reason this amendment is redundant .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Joint motion for a resolution on the situation in the Middle East
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Joint motion for a resolution on transatlantic relations
( Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution )
Joint motion for a resolution on the state of transatlantic dialogue
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
All in all , we are not nearly as nasty as people say we are .
Mr Gollnisch , I note that it is also an explanation of vote , really .
So you are quite entitled to present it now .
Thank you very much , Madam President .
Fine , I do not think I need to respond to those remarks .
I think everyone can testify that the way that vote took place was perfectly objective .
It is not my fault if you were not at the sitting at the time of the vote .
I do apologise !
Mrs Doyle presented a procedural motion , and we waited some time .
I can understand your being embarrassed , Mr Coûteaux .
This is all rather stupid , really !
Of course I understand your embarrassment as a Frenchman , but that is not my business .
I am the President of the European Parliament .
I do entirely understand your embarrassment , Mr Coûteaux , believe me .
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Figueiredo report ( A5-0155 / 2001 )
Madam President , the document by Mrs Figueiredo is very important .
Will Europe succeed ?
Mrs Ilda Figueiredo 's report on the programme to combat social exclusion deserves our support .
Core funding for key European networks involved in these actions should also be considered .
To my great regret , the Council has rejected some of the most important amendments .
The funding of the programme also represents a stumbling block .
Indeed , I think the programme ought to be as determined as possible .
A Programme of Community Action to combat social exclusion must be fully supported .
It is in fact concentrated in many specific blackspots .
There will also be continued national support for local job creation programmes under the principle of subsidiarity .
We do not want to build a two-tier Europe , or a Europe of the haves and have nots .
It is very important that education and training opportunities are given to those without skills .
It is equally important to give retraining opportunities to those in the existing workplace .
We cannot assume that work is the only activity that implies that you are a worthy citizen .
It is essential that we are given this opportunity .
Ferber report ( A5-0138 / 2001 )
They are both veterans and pensioners of the future European force .
' How are you ? ' asks the captain .
' Fine , and you ? ' answers the general .
' Not so good , ' says the Italian .
' Why ? '
' Because my pension is too low , ' says the Italian captain .
' But no , ' continues the Englishman , ' my pension is quite high , actually . '
' How much is it ?
Oh , three times as much as mine !
There are also , however , institutional and technical issues to examine .
We cannot , therefore , vote in favour of this rejection .
Schleicher report ( A5-0167 / 2001 )
Europe is being constructed by beginning to construct European centres for doing politics .
As long as we have national parties , we will never have a Europe .
The same applies to European parties .
Moreover , the small parties of today could be the big parties of tomorrow .
We should not close the doors on the future .
In fact , this measure excludes the parties that support territorial identities , even if they are sizeable .
It is a profoundly unfair measure , and that is why we have voted against it .
Madam President , I would like to thank you for your skilful and impartial management of the sittings .
My remarks concern Mr Schleicher ' s report on the financing of European political parties .
For this reason I voted against donations by companies .
Of course , they will deprive those not large enough of that funding .
What about those who would challenge the Treaties ?
What about those who will be challenging the Charter of Fundamental Rights ?
They are pariahs , vermin , scum .
They will be deprived of financing .
They will be prosecuted .
As in Belgium , they will be placed under police surveillance .
They will be dragged before the courts .
Today ' s totalitarian system is no longer behind any iron curtain .
In terms of content , the proposed text turns the logical progress of a free society on its head .
The perversion , however , does not end there .
The Treaty contains provisions concerning the political parties .
An important point are the demands that European parties be representative .
- ( DA ) We have voted against the report for two basic reasons .
The first reason concerns the content of the report .
It is contrary to democratic principles to favour larger political groupings over smaller groupings .
The word ' appear ' is highly suspicious .
Finally , provision is made for contributions to be published for the sake of transparency .
Woe betide that it should say the opposite !
In my view , this proposal is mainly a tool for legalising this unprofessional conduct .
It is therefore important that we regulate on this .
Thus , they do not safeguard justice for minorities and the protection of the latter .
Today ' s decision is premature .
Democracy means , first and foremost , respect for the law .
Court of Justice case law on this point is as clear as day .
There is no Community competence .
Next , democracy means transparency .
Democracy is also respect for minorities .
. ( NL ) It is important for a democratic Europe to have European parties .
They offer the citizen the opportunity to vote for a party directly .
In order to form major European parties , a sound legal basis is required .
We cannot be bought .
We are at the service of the citizen who has elected us .
Brussels is an attractive base for industry to lobby from .
Lobbyists often perform the useful task of informing us .
I would call on the Greens , the Liberals and the Christian-Democrats to support this standard .
Jové Peres report ( A5-0137 / 2001 )
It is almost time for lunch , Madam President .
At the moment , the EU provides aid per ton of olive oil .
This form of aid requires the monitoring of actual production .
Such monitoring has not operated at all satisfactorily .
The Member States have not been anything like good enough at doing the monitoring .
Unfortunately , the Commission is able to cover up its unacceptable action with the collusion of the Greek government .
Gebhardt report ( A5-0153 / 2001 )
This should not become a way of achieving a lowest common factor of protection .
May I remark that the provision on national representatives allows for substitutes ?
His answer was unequivocal : ' It is an important document .
I followed his suggestion and therefore I voted in favour .
This apparent moderation , however , conceals several traps .
As we see it , this surreptitious transformation of the original text is utterly unacceptable .
The European Parliament is once again treating the deep feelings of the Member States with disdain .
Is this progress in common security ?
No , more like another step towards confusion of powers .
Situation in the Middle East ( RC B5-0344 / 2001 )
Madam President , this is a very serious and important argument .
The Pensioners ' Party believes that these should not be the reasons that make us do things .
As we all know , Israel has occupied Palestinian territories since 1947 .
It is time for sanctions against Israel , Mrs Lindh .
That is deplorable .
It is the extremist and terrorist violence which is holding back the peace process .
I feel uncomfortable in approving the so-called compromise resolution .
I find too many condemnations of Israel in it .
It is not a resolution that expresses an equal distance from the parties in question .
And Europe never spoke up at times like that .
State of the Transatlantic dialogue ( RC B5-0342 / 2001 and RC B5-0345 / 2001 )
I experienced the warmth , the enthusiasm , the creativity and the intelligence of the American citizens .
Cercas report ( A5-0147 / 2001 )
In doing so , the report imposes a certain vision : the pursuit of social convergence .
Consequently , Member States are afforded little scope for creating their own solutions .
It is precisely the diversity of systems that requires every Member State to use its own tailored approach .
We have more than enough to deal with .
As such , the report is not in touch with reality .
Pensions will thus become unsafe , untenable and unaffordable .
The document by the European Commission , on the other hand , gives a clear analysis of the issue .
The Commission document has a much more targeted approach .
The report is thus no improvement on the Commission document .
We therefore cannot vote for the report .
We therefore see no reason why we should go along with the proposed change of strategy .
Many of the children that are presently being born will live to the age of 120 or more .
The fact of the matter is simply this .
People are living longer .
People are leading healthier lives .
Equally , those working in the private sector will have to look more carefully at their pension plans .
I am aware that EU leaders discussed this matter when they met in Stockholm recently .
For that reason , I abstained .
So there you have it !
The rapporteur has managed to duck the issue in 31 convoluted paragraphs .
One of the goals of the Lisbon Process is to increase the number of women in the workforce .
In this way , it was hoped that taxes and pension premiums would drop .
The only way to stave off that poverty then is to suddenly raise government spending sharply .
This report still leaves something to be desired but is moving in the right direction .
You are sowing an anti-grass roots storm and you will reap a grass-roots hurricane .
However , you can be sure that what you are trying to do will not wash !
Buitenweg report ( A5-0166 / 2001 )
( The sitting was suspended at 1.30 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
Situation in Algeria
The first item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0350 / 2001 by Belder , on behalf of the EDD Group , on the situation in Algeria ;
B5-0394 / 2001 by Caullery , on behalf of the UEN Group , on the situation in Algeria ;
As a result , it is possible to lock up Algerian journalists more quickly and for longer .
At long last , the state printing office can no longer prevent our publications .
We have taken a portion of the power from those in power . '
How exactly ?
The Algerians sum up this abhorrent government attitude in a single word : ' hogra ' .
' Hogra ' is , in other words , the key word in Algeria ' s tragedy today .
Mr President , since December 1991 , Algeria has been in a situation of permanent violence .
So far , however , this policy has had a very limited effect .
It does not seem to have been accepted as a true policy of total democratisation and reconciliation .
The situation is really very critical .
Tomorrow , a delegation from this Parliament will travel to Algeria .
What choice did they have other than to rebel and bemoan their fate ?
Are they supposed to keep quiet as well ?
Is the government supposed to turn a blind eye as well ?
Otherwise , this fire will continue to smoulder beneath the surface of Algeria .
Mr President , Algeria has a turbulent history .
When social exclusion is combined with national sentiment , the result is powerful and explosive .
Secondly , there is the danger of Islamism , which is systematically fomented by certain groups .
We must therefore give the country our support , but we must proceed very sensitively .
President Bouteflika has taken steps towards opening up Algeria .
He has moved towards reform .
These are signs of openness , and they are important .
Once again , our courageous foreign affairs ministers have decided to put their heads in the sand .
The entire world is being condemned , except for Algeria .
The MEDA agreements demand respect for diversity .
One third of the Algerian population are Berbers .
Pluriformity should form part of the state fabric .
At this moment in time , I still have grave doubts as to whether that is the case .
President Bouteflika constantly promises to contain the violence .
He pledges to investigate the recent tragedy in Kabylia , but will the guilty be punished ?
So these were peaceful demonstrations calling for more social progress and greater freedom and democracy .
Numerous eye witness accounts printed in the newspapers talk of outright brutality .
President Bouteflika and the national assembly announced that committees of inquiry would be set up .
Yet many of our hopes have not been fulfilled .
There can be no consensus here .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission deplores the recent incidents in Kabylie .
The issue of the disappearances of individuals is of particular concern to us .
The Commission will continue to pursue this issue vigorously in future .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will be taken today at 6.30 p.m.
Situation in Bosnia / Herzegovina , particularly Banya Luka
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
Needless to say , there are also opposing forces , and those claim victims .
We cannot be deterred now , however .
Above all , however , it is vital that Republika Srpska plays its part .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today we are discussing an incident concerning a mosque .
This mosque was not destroyed in any war .
This mosque stood in Banja Luka , where there was no war .
We never liked this Agreement .
This situation has proved highly problematical in practice .
In essence , we have created an artificial product .
Do we really expect Bosnia 's inexperienced politicians to cope with this state of affairs today ?
It is extremely difficult .
What 's more , we do not always help each entity equally .
The numbers of people returning are still too low .
I think we must appeal to everyone to take action here .
In my view , we should also have no qualms about coupling financial assistance with conditions at last .
There is now a new government in office , and we really must proceed with caution .
Refugees wishing to return must be able to do so .
The same naturally applies to the neighbouring region of Croatia as well .
We have addressed a number of other issues in our motion as well .
They will never be successful .
The moderates are stronger , and we must give them our support .
This is the best contribution we can make to promoting peaceful relations between the communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina .
Mr President , what is the European Union ' s task with regard to Bosnia ?
That is , of course , not difficult to answer .
We also need to call a spade a spade .
That sounds simplistic , but it is a fact which we very often ignore .
In my view , Doris Pack pointed the right way forward here .
Dayton was a step towards the absence of war .
Now it is time to start moving towards genuine peace .
There is a considerable lack of symmetry as regards the extradition of indicted persons to The Hague .
Unfortunately , that distorts our view of what is important in the region .
My colleague Chris Patten , who is responsible for this area of work , is visiting Bosnia this afternoon .
The European Union will not withdraw from Bosnia and Herzegovina .
Of the 18 measures in total , just 5 have been fully implemented so far .
In contrast to CARDS , the Commission 's reciprocal macrofinancial assistance is not linked to specific conditions .
Commissioner Verheugen , thank you very much for your statement .
As you know , the Commission is not a member of the Council of Europe .
I would be very happy to assist you , of course .
He is only human , and we must accept that !
This was rejected yet again , so we only have the Thursday .
I assume that it is too late for you to change these arrangements for today .
We have already had this problem several times on Thursdays .
We obviously need more practice !
Then there is the debate about three reports .
This is painful .
As international community , we have concluded a partnership deal .
We will sign this as ' the Cotonou Agreement ' .
In that document , we aim to establish good relations by entering into a dialogue with each other .
This is , in fact , possible within the framework of the Cotonou Agreement .
In a way , I appreciate the efforts that this is costing them .
That is why we will give our unqualified support to this resolution .
Unfortunately , this image has been brutally shattered .
I strongly commend this resolution to the House and hope it will be adopted unanimously this evening .
They are referring to disappearances , extra-judicial executions , tortures , mass graves and overcrowded prisons .
However , that is not enough , of course .
Cameroon suffers from an enormously huge problem of lawlessness .
We welcome this , and will give our full cooperation .
No difficulty , be it economic , social or demographic should or could justify torture .
They deserve and have our solidarity .
Press freedom in the world
Should we not also consider whether this is an area where we can make a contribution ?
Mr President , press freedom is one of the keystones that underpins real democracy .
As Social-Democrats we consider this topic of press freedom to be a cornerstone of our belief .
That affects diversity in a fundamental way .
This becomes even more serious if economic power and political power are combined .
That is when freedom is at risk .
I do not need to name any names to make myself clear .
In fact , it has threatened to vote against this resolution if this section were to be adopted .
It will make for an interesting outcome of the vote .
Mr President , I speak as a journalist .
Then something absolutely regrettable happened .
I do not even want to waste words on this .
Last Sunday , 18 million Italians gave their answer .
I just want to see the result of all this .
We only believe in positive values .
The journalists then asked : who will give us the money to publish newspapers ?
The matter has still not been settled .
I should like to add that the problem of the press is part of the struggle for power .
Turning conformists into saints , however , is not a job that can be regulated by resolutions .
Mr President , thank you , also for this piece of advice .
In many cases , the journalists involved get killed .
The trend is clear .
Needless to say , we also need to keep a watchful eye on democracy in Europe .
I find the initiative of Mr Van den Berg ( PSE ) an interesting one to contemplate .
In fact , we should also be aware that this phenomenon not only occurs in Italy , of course .
There are similar developments in other countries too .
There is one further problem in particular , namely the growing tendency to separate information from commentary .
Mr President , I should like to start by making a brief comment on Ethiopia .
The Commission welcomes the fact that this issue has been tabled for debate here .
It also regretted the violent action on the part of the security forces .
It has made declarations proposing the process and - where necessary - voicing its concerns .
The Commission thinks this is the best way of supporting the efforts of the UN .
This decisive process should , in its view , be promoted and shaped by the people concerned .
At the present time , the Commission considers a formal summit organised by the international community to be premature .
It has also examined a support programme in the area of the criminal justice system .
The situation is being monitored on the ground together with the Member States .
He is seriously injured but , thank God , he will survive .
Assistance ranges from training measures for journalists to media monitoring .
Support under the European initiative should continue .
Thank you , Commissioner Verheugen .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
Forced labour by African children
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
Children are being shipped off to work on plantations .
In short , children are often slaves .
May I ask the ladies and gentlemen in the galleries not to clap .
However , I must ask you to observe the democratic rules of play here in Europe .
After all , we are all Europeans .
That contravenes all kinds of ILO Treaties .
It is also fundamentally at odds with the Cotonou Agreement .
That is not done , however .
Children have human rights , which are fundamental agreements .
That is a situation which simply cannot be tolerated .
The violation of children ' s rights should finally be a thing of the past .
Child traffickers rarely get caught or punished .
At the same time , we must have the courage to tackle the underlying causes : poverty and unemployment .
That makes us indirect accessories to what is happening .
What is the point ?
Finally , I think it is important for us to think about much more potent matters .
When we see how European children grow up , we have to think about these African children .
( Applause from the left )
This is the primary objective of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement .
At the same time , the Commission is funding measures which will help directly to resolve this problem .
The Commission emphatically supports these initiatives .
Thank you , Commissioner Verheugen .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
I have an announcement to make .
Floods in France
The next item is the joint debate of the following motions for resolutions :
There is much uncertainty as to whether they will be able to regain their original production levels .
The financial consequences are unquantifiable as yet .
We have seen how far rapid reaction facilities are lacking .
However , most importantly , we need to study the issue in depth .
Thousands of people have been evacuated , often having lost everything .
The damage to infrastructures , houses and crops has been put at several billion francs .
This wave of solidarity , however , which many citizens have been involved in , is still not enough .
The floods have caused huge damage - estimated at several hundred million euros .
Houses are subsiding .
Madam President gave me a positive reply and I thank her for that .
I should also like to take the opportunity to thank the honourable Members who finally rallied to this initiative .
This initiative should not - I repeat should not - be a simple declaration of intent .
It should be backed as quickly as possible by practical decisions and tangible action .
Finally , measures should also be taken to fight the consequences of climatic change .
That is the purpose of my amendment .
I am from a neighbouring region , and my father was born in Abbeville .
I have regular contact with the département of the Somme .
It is to be expected that we should express our desire for solidarity with this resolution .
This crisis is not exceptional because it is going to continue .
This is a disaster that is going to go on and on , and it will not go away .
We must take both immediate and long-term action .
Everything must be done in order to assist these people , who have suffered considerably .
It is a sign of progress that everyone here today acknowledges this .
Once the water levels have subsided , it will be time to work out who is responsible .
To cite fate , high tides or exceptional levels of rainfall is not enough .
The only way to respond to the suffering of the people is with practical , swift and effective action .
The Commission has also introduced measures to extend the seed time beyond 15 June .
Unfortunately , the Commission cannot see how it can accommodate this request .
Thank you , Commissioner Verheugen .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters
As a result , it is again your turn to speak .
, deputising for the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
We must admit that this is a very delicate subject .
In my personal view , we never shall have uniform criminal law .
There are states which have the death penalty and there are other states which do not .
In this respect , the EU is far more uniform .
There is no place here for countries with the death penalty .
Even England and Scotland have very different criminal laws and legal traditions .
We talk a great deal about a European community of values .
This will make mutual recognition more and more difficult .
Of course we know that there are considerable problems today .
I could quote many examples .
I think that we have before us an important report .
Mr President , I fully agree with Mrs Palacio .
I too therefore invite Parliament to approve this important and thoroughly well argued report without reservation .
The discussion of certain definitions appears to be random rather than systematic , as far as I can see .
And then it would be curtains for the rule of law !
Mutual recognition , ladies and gentlemen , is only effective if it can be achieved without great administrative obstacles .
A degree of mutual trust is therefore required between Member States concerning their judicial procedures .
There are differences between our Member States , despite their extremely substantial , noteworthy common cultural and legal heritage .
The concept originates from the internal market .
Some of the projects proposed in the programme have already been started .
The resolution calls for full application of the ne bis in idem principle .
We must face the fact in our daily work that the devil is in the detail .
Obviously it would be helpful to push this development forward .
It is time we put flesh on the bones of the theoretical concept of mutual recognition .
Works councils and redundancies
The next item is the Commission statement on works councils and redundancies .
I have hardly sat down .
Restructuring is often used as a euphemism for redundancies .
I intend at this point to confine myself to the legal aspects .
The Commission will press for the Council to adopt the directive on 11 June .
We hope that a consensus will be reached .
Now to the Statute for European Companies .
Finally , to the revision of the directive on European works councils .
Globalisation and industrial change bring social problems in their wake .
I think the Commission is right to criticise how companies are behaving at present .
It proves that works councils have , as a rule , fulfilled their duties .
This is often not the case .
I think that the Europe of the future is also a Europe of the workers .
My second and final point relates to mergers .
One year on from Lisbon , the outlook is bleak .
We have the responsibility of setting this high-speed train in motion .
Our objective is to have a Europe that works on two fronts : economic dynamism and genuine social democracy .
The Commission has demonstrated its will to make progress on this issue .
All we need to do now is persuade the Council .
The European public is now demanding practical and meaningful measures .
Therefore , Commissioner , I would like you to give clear answers to three questions .
You mentioned it yourself and it is cautious and to my mind , quite inadequate .
Nevertheless , the Council , to this day , refuses to review it .
Have I understood correctly ?
My second question is this : the directive on establishing a European works councils dates back to 1995 .
To this day , only a minority of companies concerned has implemented the directive .
I feel that the Commission ' s working programme for 2001 ignores this problem .
Why is this the case , Commissioner , and what do you intend to do now ?
What are your plans on this matter ?
Only in the case of workers ' rights does this still not happen in Europe .
They are seated in the gallery and I should like to welcome them .
They must instead be the main beneficiaries of it .
The Commission sees this debate as important support for its initiatives .
For which I also thank you .
I should like to comment on the specific questions asked .
You also understood correctly that the Commission takes the view that this directive must contain sanctions .
The results of this examination are not yet ready .
That brings us to the end of that item .
However , this bill has yet to be passed by the French government .
Until then no date for final acceptance has been set .
The Commission is therefore determined to continue to make decisive progress with this file .
Can we believe a word it says ?
Where stands the credibility of the Council and the whole European Union ?
Ladies and gentlemen , let us make no mistake about this .
I have also taken good note of the European lesson given on this matter by my British fellow Member .
In 1997 and 1998 , our group opposed this directive .
The debate is closed .
( The sitting was suspended at 6.20 p.m. and resumed at 6.30 p.m. )
The next item is the vote
Mr President , on a point of order .
You make a very valid point .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
' Cristina , I am a Europeanist ! ' I replied .
' Great !
Now all the MEPs know that I am not keen on studying .
What an impression you have given the other MEPs of me ! '
Something which may be against the law in one Member State , is not in another .
That concludes the vote .
Adjournment of the session
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament .
( The sitting was adjourned at 6.45 p.m. )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday , 17 May 2001 .
Statement by the President
I would ask you to observe a minute ' s silence .
( The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence )
The next item is the order of business .
First of all , I have two pieces of information to give to you .
( The order of business was adopted thus amended )
We want quicker justice and tougher legislation .
This is what is called ENFOPOL 29 .
It has never been discussed in this Parliament .
It is a fundamental rights issue .
( Applause from the Verts / ALE Group )
Madam President , I should like to address the same issue .
In other words , there would be no part of the communication that was not monitored .
That was not even mentioned in the documents before the Council .
We have no way of getting hold of the information !
It appears that , because of a formal error , the actual decision has not yet been taken .
It can be taken at any time , however , and no further meeting is required for the purpose .
I should like to repeat the call . We need to debate this .
( Applause from the Verts / ALE Group )
This paragraph says : ' There is no doubt about the purpose of Santiago ' s murderers .
Specific technological R & D programme
It is my pleasure to give the floor to Mr Busquin .
The specific programmes are the instruments for implementation .
The proposals do , however , provide some clarification .
I would like to reiterate the main principles .
In order to implement the Framework Programme , we are proposing a structure based on five specific programmes .
This structure is a faithful reflection of that of the Framework Programme and translates the political project into reality .
This is the meaning of Article 169 .
Our aim is , therefore , to launch a political debate on this issue .
Thank you , Mr Busquin , for your statement .
That is a major achievement .
I have two explicit questions to put to the Commissioner .
Why does he not apply Article 168 of the Treaty ?
Surely that would be a far more practical approach .
Mr Van Velzen will be given a very clear answer to this in the answers to the questions .
What are the reasons ?
We therefore have fewer specific programmes for the sectoral themes .
Are you not afraid this will make the framework research programme less visible ?
We must not , therefore , expect the Framework Programme to fund all European research .
We have therefore attempted to tackle the problem by dealing with priority issues first .
We are , therefore , aiming for consistency rather than to cover a whole range of problems .
We will , obviously , be able to go into much more detail in the content of the priorities .
I think that the current shortcomings are well known .
We must encourage coherent action .
Madam President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for his explanation .
That was not my question , however .
I hope that this will now change .
It is Wednesday today , and we shall , therefore , answer them before the end of the week .
Ultimately , I am still asking the question - what else do you wish to add ?
Mobility is extremely important for providing research with a truly European dimension .
There are , therefore , obstacles that we must try to face and to remove .
It would be extremely useful for many people in Europe to know what is being done .
European research is therefore absolutely urgent .
We are , moreover , planning to allocate EUR 600 million to this section of the programme .
I would also like to confirm that we support the general structure of the project .
My second question concerns the instruments .
Thank you , Mr Caudron .
This is quite clear and that is why we need new instruments .
I understand the concerns felt every time the word ' new ' is mentioned .
It is difficult to adapt to change and this is to be expected .
The proposal is , therefore , understood .
I hope that our proposal will be adopted .
I believe , therefore , that this could be done .
My last point relates to the Joint Research Centre .
I believe that public opinion can no longer accept the massive slaughtering of healthy animals .
( no microphone ) ... problems relating to research , since I am speaking about research .
Could you give us a reassurance that you will be devoting the necessary attention to research in this field ?
Europe is lagging behind in areas such as spending of resources .
Could we , despite this , assume that fundamental research in Europe will not lag behind ?
Studies of this type are planned .
They must step up their efforts .
This is a positive aspect that we are indeed attempting to make known as far and wide as possible .
The Framework Programme must play a part in increasing awareness of this issue .
I fully support what Mr Schwaiger has said as that is exactly what we want to do .
For the first time , we are attempting to establish links between them .
Madam President , I welcome the Commissioner ' s statement that he is in listening mode .
I fully understand this question .
I believe that this is the type of discussion that we are going to have .
First of all , let me take the content of the priorities .
I recently attended a meeting of the leading European cancer specialists .
One of our objectives is , therefore , to create a network of the leading cancer researchers .
There is no contradiction whatsoever .
It is true that this has not been planned in Category 8 .
We could , therefore , put ' co-operate ' on , for example , all epidemiological data .
EUR 400 million has been set aside to strengthen the European Research Area .
There are several angles of attack .
These aspects must always be taken into consideration .
The second question relates to the instruments .
I would therefore like the Commissioner to respond to this double concern .
Mr Westendorp y Cabeza has asked a fundamental question .
We will try to answer it point by point .
I have already mentioned this .
What , then , is the meaning of the question ?
The risks of dispersion will increase with new countries joining the EU and with enlargement .
This is the negative aspect .
We are managing 14 000 projects .
I would like to say once again that the European Research Area is not simply the European Framework Programme .
The European Framework Programme is an aspect of the European Research Area .
We must , therefore , play a part in this .
That is our aim .
Have we taken account of this important issue in connection with the restructuring of the Commission 's procedures ?
I fully support what Mr Rovsing has said .
The new instruments aim to provide greater responsibility and increased flexibility .
This is absolutely clear .
We certainly think the programme as a whole is going well , but it does need improvement .
That is the task we must undertake together .
Improvement is needed , for example , in the general approach , which is still too bureaucratic .
Thank you , Mr Nisticò .
This is one of the fundamental criteria .
Thank you , Mr Busquin .
I would also like to thank all the Members who have taken part in the debate .
The debate is closed .
Can I make a suggestion for the future .
It might help us .
Certainly , Mr Purvis .
Your suggestion has my support .
Treaty of Nice and the future of the EU
Amsterdam is one more step in that direction .
The Treaty of Nice has not resolved many of these issues .
It has only resolved some of them , satisfactorily in some cases and insufficiently in others .
The Treaty of Nice itself contains the seed of such a reform .
This Parliament also wishes to see the Intergovernmental Conferences prepared by means of a democratic method .
Because we want serious and far-reaching solutions .
We therefore propose , firstly , a new method of preparing for a revision of the Treaties .
We want a convention .
( The speaker approached the President-in-Office of the Council and gave her the aforementioned sticker )
Thank you , Mr Seguro .
The sticker matches the Mrs Lindh ' s suit perfectly .
That is a good sign !
Madam President-in-Office of the Council , I shall now give you the floor .
, Council .
The EU ' s future lies in coordinating foreign policy so that we can prevent armed conflicts .
The Union is also currently working on developing its cooperation with Africa .
An EU troika is visiting West Africa at this moment .
The responsibility and future of the EU also encompass a global responsibility .
Europe must mean more than a market .
The future of the EU lies in an open and democratic union .
An important aim must be to make citizens more active participants in the European project .
The institutions are also planning a number of common seminars and conferences .
Their hopes and expectations will undoubtedly extend further than the four institutional issues pointed out in Nice .
I think this is a good thing .
Before we attempt to define our tools , we must know what the tools are to be used for .
The same applies to the debate concerning a ' constitution ' .
As quite a few people have said , the existing Treaties already form a kind of constitution .
Democracy is not a zero sum game .
Both national and European parliamentarians have a direct mandate from the people .
Some think that a small group of so-called wise men should table proposals .
We need a combination .
The Swedish Presidency will continue the discussions with the European Parliament alongside the deliberations in the Council .
This will naturally also form an important basis for the presidency when we present a report in Gothenburg .
I now look forward to your viewpoints .
Please allow me therefore to illustrate and expand on it a little .
This was the right time to do it without waiting any longer .
This legal problem has not been resolved in Nice .
This frankly causes frustration in Parliament .
The European Union is strong wherever the Monnet method is used .
The European Union is weak wherever the intergovernmental method is used .
We need to remind ourselves why the Nice Conference took place .
We therefore have to recognise that the present method is no longer working .
We have to see to it that the citizens of this Europe enjoy their rights .
That is why the Charter must be made binding .
We must make this European Union democratic .
There must therefore be codecision in all matters of legislation , including agricultural policy .
We must make it transparent so that citizens know who is responsible for a bad decision .
That is why the Council as legislator must meet openly .
These are the decisive measures that we must get accepted at this Intergovernmental Conference !
At the same time , it is also necessary to strengthen the national parliaments .
That must be the starting point !
( Applause )
( Applause )
I represent fisheries policy .
The democratic deficit of which we rightly complain is all the more obvious to all concerned .
The future of Europe ' s fisheries from 2003 is being rewritten at this very moment .
A mere consultation of Parliament is not enough .
We want to be really involved in defining the most important themes .
It is only logical .
We hope that a means will be found for supporting such meetings .
The second is the financial consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty in 2002 .
I would like to address the President-in-Office of the Council because she has said some important things .
Firstly , she has said that she has launched a virtual forum .
We could also seek formulae so that we can connect to our own debates .
The forum now exists .
She has indicated that it might be appropriate to create a committee of wise men .
I am in favour of the idea that experienced political leaders should not go on the dole .
We could look for some political leaders to advise us .
I am very pleased to hear the President-in-Office 's positive remarks in that regard .
A " yes " vote is a vote to reunite Europe .
I urge my fellow citizens in Ireland to take that into account .
The problem with Nice is how much more was left to be done .
These people are themselves still incomplete democrats .
We should not accept lectures from them on this topic .
We know that NATO and the US would not act and did not act .
We , the EU , could not act .
If not NATO there was nothing .
This represents responsibility and maturity in Europe , not militarisation .
I have been very generous with time for the three political group leaders .
Mr President , what kind of generosity would it be that confined itself to the large groups ?
It would be a power-based generosity that I would not like to think you capable of !
We are witnessing and involved in a struggle for power in Europe .
The Intergovernmental Conference in Nice was a failure .
The Intergovernmental Conference has proved to be an unsuitable instrument .
The heads of state and government are making Europe into a bazaar of national interests .
Ladies and gentlemen , I am terribly bored with the debate about a federal state or a confederation !
Nice has weakened the Community .
Nice was a step backwards in terms of integration .
I want to take up a few points here that I consider important .
There can be no discrimination against these two countries in their parliamentary representation in this House .
Post-Nice must tackle an ambitious , really far-reaching reform , a reform that must achieve two things .
It is no longer the appropriate way of carrying Europe substantially forwards .
Europe ' s future cannot remain confined to the market and common currency .
The European Union will remain a Union of peoples and states .
The unanimity requirement for tax changes remains the order of the day within the Union .
Enlargement of the Union will promote and consolidate democratic structures in Eastern and Central Europe .
What really was the background to the Treaty of Nice ?
All right , it had to do with the enlargement and integration of the European continent .
There are only two remarks to be made about this .
We can see this in the curious provision whereby the EU élites are to supervise the democracies .
What kind of talk is that ?
Is it not the people who supervise their democracies ?
No , it has to be the EU élites .
What kind of view of democracy is that ?
Finally : are the various populations being asked about this Treaty ?
The Danish people are not being asked .
I think that then we would all stand to benefit .
Everyone is well aware that the common agricultural policy is on its last legs .
We oppose any form of European nationalism .
Almost everything has already been said about Nice .
The arguments put forward for that are not convincing .
For one thing we also have important elections in Europe in 2003 .
It can therefore easily be accommodated after the elections to the European Parliament .
Be warned !
They are all extremely useful .
What we do hope for is convergence on the proposal for a convention .
Parliament will bring wisdom and commitment to the process and focus upon common European solutions .
This would subvert the convention and it would be an insult to this Parliament .
It would also ruin the pretence that the European Council respected the role of national parliaments .
Of course it does .
That does not necessarily imply a full-scale federation along the lines of Mr Schroeder .
Mr MacCormick , I am sorry I did not recognise that yesterday was one your special birthdays .
I do not believe that this is correct .
This is because the institutional issues involved in the enlargement are not resolved by the Treaty of Nice .
The decision-making process in the Council of Ministers will become more complicated , not simpler .
However , it is important to point out that the report does contain some positive elements .
It calls for open meetings of the Council of Ministers .
However , we do not believe in the convention method .
So what should have been done in Nice instead ?
Now we are instead seeing the social democrat governments starting to fall around the EU .
The so-called crisis facing the European Union is a result of this federalist obsession .
We could concentrate on reforming the institutions so that they function more effectively .
We could begin here in Parliament , where democratic representation is so lacking in authenticity and so mediocre .
But no !
Instead , you want to reform everything else .
This has opened up the fight for power .
The federalists like invoking the founding fathers , but they would do better to read what they said .
Where is the real cohesion ?
Exactly the opposite .
We do not want to see a United States of Europe , but a Community .
Nothing more and nothing less .
Who is abandoning ship here ?
Who is actually destroying the Europe that has been successfully achieved ?
Drafting a European constitution is another perverse fantasy .
If there is no single European people , there can be no legitimate constituent European power .
If there is no constituent European power , there can be no European constitution .
Treaties can only be reformed by Treaties .
( The President cut the speaker off )
That is not our view .
This Treaty will not facilitate enlargement - on the contrary , it will complicate the issue .
Mr President , Nice was simply not a successful Summit .
Maybe we would not be facing this debacle now .
The question is now how to ensure that these proposals actually take shape .
I wish you good luck in Gothenburg , and I hope that a convention will ensue .
That appears to be the best solution to me .
Conservatives back home , however , are coming up with this idea that this Treaty sets up a superstate .
The public can see through this particular fanciful idea .
Why is only Ireland holding a referendum ?
Why not Denmark and others ?
It is not a centralising treaty and the critics , of course , know that .
Rejecting Nice would have caused delay and confusion .
Yes , it needs improvement , but so does our method for working on it .
Hence Parliament 's demand for a convention of the Council , not just a forum .
The forum is the wide debate that is taking place with civil society .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , the Treaty of Nice is obviously open to a wide range of interpretations .
It also leaves much to be desired in democratic respects .
The method for the Intergovernmental Conference is rather reminiscent of that for choosing a new pope .
During that time nobody knows what is happening .
However , now the next treaty is to be prepared differently - together with the citizens .
It is important to remember these fine speeches when the plans are being made for Laeken .
Perhaps it will be a convention after all .
It is the most open and democratic way of preparing proposals .
However , now there are rumours that it will be a convention without government representatives .
So what will it be ?
A talking shop , an alibi that the ministers then ride roughshod over ?
It is not a good solution !
It is also time to turn away from Nice and look to the future .
Some Heads of Government are also doing so .
We want them to become our allies in obtaining two things : a constitution and a convention .
We expect their support on these two matters .
They gained more votes at the expense of small countries .
The Treaty of Nice was justified by the needs of enlargement .
This is an unparliamentary and undemocratic method .
Other countries do not dare to ask their citizens , who are the sole subjects of democracy .
This is a huge new political fact which cannot be disregarded .
I hope France is not going to maintain this position in the future .
Only certain matters were regulated by a common authority .
How did they deal with decision-making in those days ?
Every province used to have veto right in all decisions .
Furthermore , the representatives were not authorised to render decisions binding upon their provinces .
That was only possible following approval from the province .
The complex political system evidently did not cause any obstacles .
The European Union is said to head for a deadlock , unless more far-reaching and in-depth centralisation takes place .
I would call that into question .
Decision-making will mainly depend on consensus among governments .
The past has shown that this can also be reached unanimously .
More important , however , is the EU ' s future stability .
That will depend largely on the extent to which its decisions are experienced as being legitimate .
The EU ' s legitimacy is a far greater problem than its complex political structure .
However , the legitimacy of decision-making cannot be enhanced by centralisation .
That is why I shall be voting against it .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on this objective , interesting report .
They deserve our sincere thanks .
As Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , I should have liked the language to have been clearer .
We regret that precisely because we want enlargement and want it as quickly as possible .
Unfortunately , the draft repeatedly speaks of a constitution .
I want to argue here for the clear legal concept of a constitutional treaty .
Nice was the summit of interests , not to mention the summit of national egoism .
The post-Nice process now gives us the opportunity to reassert the importance of politics .
We do not need any new institutions .
Let us strengthen the existing institutional triangle .
Mr President , this report does not reflect the political reality of the sub-state situation .
This is the desire of many people in Europe .
Mr Méndez de Vigo , this report gives hope to many of us .
The Treaty of Nice allows a core group of Member States to form an elite inner circle .
That should be unthinkable .
Mr President , I disagree with this report for three basic reasons .
The lowest possible number !
We have already endured that situation .
We have had the work in committee and now we have to make a choice in plenary .
We are not convinced this is the right course .
We believe that there should be an early IGC .
I look forward to the debate at that time .
Mr President , the Treaty of Nice represents both a failure and an opportunity .
One thing is quite clear , however .
That is how simple it is , irrespective of the reasons given for voting against .
I would also like briefly to touch on the criticism of Nice .
After all , we know the problems that we see arising when decisions have to be taken unanimously .
Now we are making decisions by qualified majority in many more areas .
Finally I would like to thank you for today ' s debate .
Parliament cannot stand on the sidelines of this debate .
Parliament must promote a debate going beyond the pragmatism that ties the hands of the national governments .
I am sure we will find that tomorrow in the vote .
This is something new and different from Maastricht and Amsterdam .
I think it should sound an alarm to the governments that negotiated this treaty .
This is a cause for concern .
It is why we cannot say a clear yes .
We want something to be done about what happened in Nice .
We all talk about it , but we still have different ideas about how it should be done .
This Parliament must therefore be strengthened .
We unite people , not states .
We therefore need the Europe of citizens and not just a Europe of governments !
Mr President , five arguments .
First , yes to the constituent convention , but it also needs to represent the regional level .
Finally , the constitution must offer an international guarantee to the minority populations of Europe .
This is the first treaty which puts Europe back .
Power on the one hand , democracy on the other .
These were the two stakes , and both have been lost .
Which is why the Europe of Nice will not work .
They are entering a house in which European impotence and a lack of transparency are the main features .
I would like it to be even more critical , however , which is why I shall abstain .
Mr President .
I agree with much of the criticism .
It is a difficult treaty that is difficult to understand .
This is something that we must change .
We need more decisions by qualified majority and codetermination rights for Parliament .
No outsiders were allowed to participate in the process .
Let us not do this again .
After all , it does not mean that we must not carry on national debate with organisations and others .
How is this to be done ?
What tools shall we use ?
We must start with the objective debate .
The answer is clearly no !
Nice is too restricted as a step forward .
We should not , however , throw away the baby with the bath water .
Everything seems to be focusing on the Belgian Presidency and the Declaration of Laeken .
This was also its main task .
How will item 42 be received in Estonia , in Poland or Cyprus ?
In other words , we are in favour of item 11 and Amendment No 68 .
Mr President , the enlargement process is the bridge from the old Europe to the new .
It is important , however , that we do not allow ourselves to become prisoners of old ideas .
This report does not close off any options .
It does not seek to give a view on the ratification of Nice .
That is being left to the Member States whose responsibility it is .
If we do , it will not happen by accident .
Nevertheless , they have real fears about aspects of the Treaty .
However , no one can afford to be complacent about the outcome of the Irish referendum .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro .
This would lead to more political integration and a new European federation .
More than anything , I want more democracy .
I therefore hope that we as a group will be achieving a decent majority for a better approach .
Take the very topical example of the common European trade policy .
It is based on common principles and there is in principle majority voting .
It is a useful treaty , but it is a short-term treaty .
There are too many unanimous votes and too many rights of veto .
Finally , to say that the voting system will remain or become more complex is an understatement .
So now we have time to start a real public debate .
What is our common objective ?
This is what is so important about the major debate to which we are committed .
I think they too should have a place at the convention table .
We shall also have to decide how best to organise the work of this convention .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Council and Commission mission to Korea
The High Representative Javier Solana and Commissioner Chris Patten participated .
In summary , the results were good .
The exports were a purely commercial issue .
I hope that a first meeting will be able to take place during the Swedish Presidency .
The EU ' s visit was a fruitful one .
However , the results of our efforts cannot be finally assessed for a couple of years yet .
We are now following up in five areas : first , existing assistance is being continued .
Since this will require negotiations , I do not wish to speculate at this point on the detail .
I welcome the fact that there were good talks with Kim Chong-il .
Clearly North Korea is a state of concern .
We welcome the fact that they are continuing their moratorium on missile tests until 2004 .
They produce hardly any goods that anyone wants to buy apart from military equipment .
Obviously we welcome the moratorium .
We welcome the further aid that is going to given in the form of food aid .
There will be no day-to-day contact if that is the case .
Some would even say it was going backwards .
I would like reassurances from the Commission and the Council on these two points .
Mr President , I just thought I could make a few comments and reply to some of the questions .
This was in the troika formation and journalists come anyway .
They were not part of the delegation , but they come .
I hope I have covered the most important issues raised .
Thank you for your contributions .
Thank you for this additional response .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow .
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
The question is what we mean by a ' sustainability strategy ' ?
Is it a new political buzzword that we are attempting to invent here in Parliament ?
No , it is not .
It is an inheritance that goes back further in time .
So what is sustainability ?
What are we actually talking about when we discuss sustainability ?
Well , we are discussing the future of coming generations .
This is not satisfactory .
It is quite simply a prerequisite that our ecology is in equilibrium .
The point has somehow been missed .
It is about utilising the economy that exists .
It is about trying to set the limits we want to have on the market .
We must see ourselves as part of the planet , in the global context .
We also have a responsibility in international trade relations .
Finally , I would like to say something about political leadership .
It cannot be simply an empty manifesto .
The debate is addressing the strategy for sustainable development and integration of environmental issues in economic policy .
This criticism can no longer be levelled at us .
An effective policy on sustainable development requires direct and clear social criticism .
We must now adopt a holistic approach in which various political areas cooperate .
We must propose concrete measures , changes in principles and clear goals .
Now is the time to formulate a vision for the future .
It is also important for the policies to be based on the everyday lives of citizens .
It will mean discarding unsustainable subsidies .
Sustainable development cannot be achieved unless the global perspective is addressed .
This is therefore the vital task for us .
The European Union must take a leading role in the work towards global sustainability .
The meeting recognised no borders between countries or between people .
So what do these young people have ?
They have involvement , they have enthusiasm .
What do they lack ?
They lack patience , they lack fear of tackling difficult and complex problems .
What do we owe them ?
I would like to end by referring to the conclusion in Mr Blokland ' s report .
I believe this conclusion complements that of Mr Blokland .
In other words we cannot afford to wait .
We are not integrating our social , economic and environmental policies .
They should be pulling in the same direction , and they certainly do not at present .
We must combat discrimination and poverty .
Sustainable development is about creating a world in which there are no losers .
Many things have been considered .
Models for these exist .
Only fair competition will ensure that environmental measures , of whatever kind , find acceptance .
Trade in environmental assets must be fair .
The Gothenburg European Council needs to take an emphatic first step in this connection .
I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Blokland on his report .
The concept of sustainable development must be translated into concrete proposals and decisions .
I should like to home in on three points in this connection : production standards , bio-diversity and compliance .
Sustainable development must be given a practical dimension .
Moreover , such markets also yield new employment .
Needless to say , we must also adhere to the Bird and Habitat Directive .
Which brings us to the third point : compliance .
There is a great deal of sound European legislation .
It is therefore necessary to comply with these laws .
However , that is often a problem .
Mrs Hulthén and Mr Bowe asked in Strasbourg how the Commission intends to deal with this problem .
It is terribly easy to write about wonderful dreams and to use fine words .
I would like to see those attending the European Council in Gothenburg dare to point the way forward .
Politically , we have three demands of Gothenburg .
As far as economic aspects per se are concerned , the ECOFIN Council needs to revise the agenda .
We also need to think about national accounts which integrate environmental data .
These are a few of the things we want to think about .
We need the means to do so , however .
If this is carried out , it will prove an important step in achieving change .
The question now is whether these concrete proposals will survive the European Council in Gothenburg .
I believe it can make a real contribution to changing this policy .
I wish the Swedish Presidency luck with this .
Let us apply the principle of subsidiarity to the management of pollution problems .
Polluted rivers are a matter for the countries along their banks .
They should be free to decide what to do - as long as they are efficient .
Changes to the climate of the planet , on the other hand , are a global issue .
To conclude , we should not regulate everything from Brussels or Strasbourg .
Decisions taken closer to the ground will be more suitable and , by definition , better understood .
Surely the ambition of the European Union is to be better understood by the people .
The PPE-DE will support the report . It contains important emphases for environmental policy .
We are not , however , really in agreement with the wording on every point .
I think more could have been said about that .
It is found here in items 21 and 22 of this report .
It concerns the removal of environmentally harmful subsidies , especially on coal .
However , I think we must be very cautious about specifying a date in the very near future .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Sustainable development concerns all policy areas .
In this regard I do not share the views of the previous speaker .
Social policy is also naturally part of sustainable development .
Good social policy and fair economic policy are vital .
Sustainable development is also about a whole range of methods .
It is not the case that the current methods of legislation are poor .
The legislation must continue .
The legislation we have in the EU must be implemented better .
We must use tax instruments , which have often been emphasised by Parliament .
Naturally , my group supports these two reports wholeheartedly .
However , this must happen now and not simply be a goal for the future .
The Cardiff Process is good , but it is proceeding far too slowly .
Such a view does not fit in with the times .
We must all realise this .
They must simply be phased out .
We cannot afford to keep them in place .
Ten years after Rio , this really must be addressed ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
We need to acknowledge ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , thank you for the various constructive contributions which we have heard .
It is right to discuss these two reports at the same time , as they definitely belong together .
We also looked extremely carefully at the proposal contained in the report by Mrs Hulthén .
In this context , Parliament will naturally also have an active role .
Of course , the global perspective must be present in everything we do .
I think this is clear in the programme .
The next step is to address this at the European Council in Gothenburg .
This will be the moment of truth for us and for the EU as a whole .
At the same time , we must also ensure that we implement this legislation .
In addition , we must make it clearer for citizens of the EU how well Member States are doing .
I believe this can help to put pressure on countries .
This is naturally vital .
Thank you for this debate .
Let us ensure that we can put these issues into practice .
Several speakers have mentioned economic growth and its impact on the environment .
There is a rather outdated view that economic growth always has an adverse impact on the environment .
This is actually nothing new .
We have been working on this for many decades without perhaps using this particular term .
At the same time emissions of greenhouse gases have fallen by 4 percent .
This shows that decoupling is already taking place .
The equivalent figure for emissions of SOx is around 80 percent .
These are two further examples of decoupling .
The issue of subsidies and international costs has also been brought up by several speakers .
Biodiversity has also been mentioned here , and this is something close to my heart .
We also need environmental issues to be integrated into the common agricultural policy .
The condition of marine biodiversity is in fact much worse than that of biodiversity on land .
The marine ecosystem around our coasts is in crisis .
It is exactly this which we will be putting right through sectoral integration .
I believe , Mr President , that these comments will suffice .
Thank you , Mr Larsson .
The debate is closed .
The vote on both reports will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
( The sitting was suspended at 8.25 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
Community Environment Action Programme ( 2001-2010 )
As you know , this is due to the programme being delayed in the Commission .
I would also like to thank the Swedish Presidency and the Commission for excellent teamwork .
I wish them every success .
Achieving environmental targets requires cooperation .
Environmental issues must be included in all Community policies and decisions .
Therefore , these also require greater environmental expertise .
Environmental assessments must also be included in economic decisions .
I see this as particularly welcome .
Enlargement is both a challenge and an opportunity for the European environment .
We must also ensure the major participation of citizens .
This requires the provision of clear and visible information on environmental issues .
Firstly , it is necessary to apply the legislation .
This has still not been done properly .
We need more sustainable models of production and consumption .
The interest in this programme is clear .
The first is the application of Community law .
Spain is currently being prosecuted over the existence of more than seven illegal dumping sites .
The first fundamental issue is therefore compliance with environmental legislation .
The second is the promotion of citizen participation .
We must find a method for complying with it .
This is unfortunately the only thing the governments understand .
Mr President , I believe that this is an extraordinary programme .
We as a group have always supported the Commission because we have believed that this was a great project .
We wanted this balanced academic nature of the Commission ' s project to be respected .
This is absurd .
Some of the amendments are excessively tough and are going to have repercussions for the citizens .
To sum up , we have believed in the project and we are supporting it .
We support the Commission .
We support the idea as a whole and most of the ideas within it .
The first relates to the need to consolidate the involvement of local authorities in the action programme .
I remember that the Commissioner shared our view .
Other than that , however , the document offers little in the way of transparency .
Despite this , the Commission saw an opportunity to produce something which we did not actually want .
That is not the right way to go about things , of course .
We do not welcome many amendments because we then cannot see the wood for the trees .
It would be far preferable to implement this at national and perhaps even at regional or local level .
We therefore offer our hesitant support to this process .
It is also true that short documents save trees .
I cannot therefore but support the honourable Member .
It also forms a vital cornerstone of the strategy for sustainable development .
We have perhaps forgotten that the Commission initially did not want the Sixth Environment Action Programme at all .
One last but illustrative point .
The conclusion of the assessment was that the objectives of the fifth environment action programme were not met .
In addition , the remaining part of the present Environment Action Programme is yet to be carried out .
The solving of environmental issues in those countries is very high on the list of priorities .
What the rapporteur has made of it makes the matter even more difficult .
I think that what the Commission laid before us was a very good starting point .
I am unable to congratulate the rapporteur .
Such legal errors are then multiplied fifteen fold in the implementation .
I find there is a lot missing from this environment programme .
I am sure we could have included it .
Only what the rapporteur has made of it does not improve matters .
I feel sorry for the Commission officials !
That was when I read the communication .
There is always something missing .
If you look at it closely , you can see precisely what it is .
In the communication , the strategic objectives - and the related measures - are set out quite clearly .
In the articles there are only vague allusions .
The communication describes the types of pollution and lists the measures .
Either list of examples can be used .
There is nothing about that at all .
The next bullet point is " Revising the bathing water directive " .
What does " revising " mean ?
Does it mean raising the standards ?
So we need greater clarity here .
The extensive explanatory note was much better .
Hence the many amendments .
We have now also received the Prodi paper for the Gothenburg Summit .
We as the Group of the Greens have tabled amendments of that ilk .
If that is the case , Parliament will be supporting an ambitious programme for the next ten years .
According to the Liberals , climate , waste and bio-diversity had to be included .
Without the sixth environment action programme , the whole issue of bio-diversity would have been overlooked .
It would not have been given priority in the current policy .
That is why I welcome this fresh initiative .
The sixth action programme makes a more or less felicitous attempt to do this .
Is this the best way of protecting the environment ?
However , we should not despair .
The proposals are still there at the centre of the document in the amendments .
The Commission can still rescue it at second reading .
Mr President , the Environment Action Programme has galvanised Parliament into a high level of activity .
It has stirred up contradictory reactions , reactions of disappointment and satisfaction .
Rapporteur , Mrs Rita Myller , has compiled an excellent report , which I back entirely .
Her report contributes towards a better and more specific Environment Action Programme .
The sixth environment action programme must become the mainstay of European strategy for sustainable development .
That too receives my unqualified support .
Two matters are of key importance to me .
She has also confirmed this in the previous debate .
I am of the view that Parliament could play a more significant role in that compliance .
Commissioner , I should like to have your opinion on the possibility of these half-yearly reports .
My second point concerns international cooperation .
Sustainable development should not remain within European borders .
International agreements are important .
One of the amendments is asking the Commission to consult Parliament before and after the event .
I would welcome this greatly .
Mr President , I would like to thank all the Members who have taken part in the discussion .
I am perhaps slightly disappointed by the view of the PPE-DE .
I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs ; in my opinion the work was carried out well .
I hope that I have succeeded in this .
Thank you once again .
We learned from that programme that implementation was not good enough .
This is what we learned .
That is always the risk if you want to make a short .
There is the risk of making it a shopping list , and I wanted to avoid that .
I wanted to make it an action programme .
Of course , I am not against targets , timetables or deadlines .
I appreciate that we have broad support for the priorities and the structure of this programme .
This is what we are working on at the moment .
It was the same in the Council when we asked what kind of targets do you mean ?
It must be based on sound science and facts and it must be achievable and viable .
I would like to say something about thematic strategies .
That has been our objective all the time .
We should not specify that in every case there should be a framework directive .
There is no link made between new actions proposed and the resources available to do the job .
Finally , we welcome this opinion .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Environmental impact of certain plans and programmes
The idea behind environmental impact assessments for plans and programmes is an old one .
This can be seen in the context of the debate held earlier today .
I was not entirely satisfied with this solution .
Thank you all .
Mr President , we are essentially satisfied with the agreement reached in conciliation .
In practice , these represent all the programmes carried out , particularly in the less favoured regions .
There is also the fear that distortions of competition might result .
This is proof of the contribution to environmental improvement that the European Community can and should continue to make .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Tyres for motor vehicles and their trailers
Of all noise sources , the noise generated by cars and lorries is the most crucial one .
The Council of Ministers of the Internal Market have neglected the noise aspect enormously .
They hardly considered the environmental aspect at all .
The gravity of the negotiations did not move the Council of Ministers a great deal .
Noise-reducing tyres are already available .
It is also important to review legislation regarding the rolling resistance of tyres .
A reduction of five to ten percent is certainly within the realms of possibility .
I should like to make a brief reference to the future .
This being the case , the noise generated by road traffic can then be reduced by five decibels .
That is 3 decibels less than we are to adopt for the year 2005 tomorrow .
That is not true !
So more can be done than proposed .
To that extent I find the compromise just about acceptable .
You and the Commission really ought to go and look at what is available on the market .
Thank you , Mr Lange .
This will place the European tyre industry at the leading edge of the technology world-wide .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Financial Regulation applicable to the EC general budget
So , Commissioner , we followed your lead .
We proposed a great many amendments .
We think it is better to keep it in the financial regulation as a legislative instrument .
We stressed the independence of OLAF .
So that finishes my five minutes as rapporteur .
I am sure you will understand that this is rather strange .
It is , after all , rather strange .
A committee which has already examined a great many of these amendments and rejected them .
Then re-tables them on behalf of its chair .
Its Kramer versus Kramer .
What would you do ?
It seems a bit bizarre to me .
Many of the amendments were , as I have said , rejected by the committee .
So , inevitably , as rapporteur , I was obliged to say that I was against .
It is embarrassing because it puts you in an awkward position .
It is embarrassing when you know that a committee has already given the thumbs down .
Others have come in from the Court of Auditors .
We are not here to give the Commission discharge .
The system is up and running , however , and Parliament has endorsed it several times .
However , we shall see tomorrow morning .
Luckily the two positions are the same on this report .
Most groups showed a great willingness to compromise .
For the Budgetary Control Committee , the reform of financial control is the key aspect of this proposal .
This displacement of responsibility means , in effect , that no one is ultimately responsible . "
Has this test been met ?
( The President urged the speaker to speak more slowly to assist the interpreters )
Second , the disciplinary procedure must be strengthened .
There has been too little action in the past .
A financial regularities committee would strengthen the procedure as would other amendments we have introduced .
Finally , minimum standards of financial controls must be adhered to .
Amendment No 72 sets this out .
We will have to negotiate with the Council on this proposal .
Thank you , Mr van Hulten .
I can assure you that your speech has been translated into perfect Dutch .
There are many practical problems which we have to look at in the external budget .
We have an annual programme which does not work consistently in terms of output targets .
I want to be proud of what we do .
I want the world to recognise that we make a substantial contribution .
I want our development assistance programme to be the best in the world .
We have a long way to go before we achieve that .
I must ask that these be kept separate and that the work not be confused in this way .
We actually have quite a good climate in the committee .
I am rather shaken by the way things are proceeding here this evening !
Mr President , recasting the Financial Regulation is a necessarily ponderous process .
The fact that their approval requires unanimity in the Council makes changing them even more difficult .
All the signs indicate that we are still to see a further stage added .
We hope that the Commission will devote the necessary attention to this in its future proposals .
Another extremely important point concerns delays in payments .
In these circumstances , all we can do is postpone delivering Parliament ' s final statement on its position .
At the same time I would like to thank Michiel van Hulten for excellent teamwork .
This would also increase their own responsibility for their work .
However , change is absolutely essential .
Finally , I would like to present some details that are important to my group .
In principle we support the proposals of the rapporteur .
Mr President , the present Financial Regulation is out of date .
It no longer meets the requirements of modern financial management .
They deserve praise and recognition for this .
However , my group finds a number of points still open .
Around EUR 2 billion were lost .
In such circumstances , is there any sense in abolishing preventive ex ante checks by independent financial control ?
We should like to restore this again through a motion .
The final point : the Advisory Committee on Procurements and Contracts .
This is the advisory body that must be consulted before contracts are awarded .
At the last session in Strasbourg , this House resolved to reform this procedure .
This evening , we are discussing the review of the Financial Regulation .
Against this backdrop , I should like to make a few observations .
The Commission and rapporteurs want to abandon centralised , independent ex ante control .
That must be replaced by decentralised ex post control .
We debated this very issue at an earlier occasion .
I am in favour of a system in which independent ex post audits are the rule .
The option of independent ex ante control must continue to exist .
I am referring to the regulation of the public markets and to subsidies .
The current situation is not only bad , but chaotic .
That really is nothing for Europe to be proud of !
Remedial action is more than necessary .
The only question is how the Commission proposes to rectify the situation .
The financial controller is also anchored in the Treaty .
That is the only way we shall get the citizens to accept it !
Thank you , Commissioner , for creating a quadrilogue for us .
Do you wish to be heard ?
You have the floor .
I have been listening very carefully to what has been said .
This will happen at the ECOFIN meeting next week .
Thank you .
Mr Dell 'Alba has asked to speak .
At this stage of the debate it can only be on a point of order .
Mr President , it is 11.20 .
I just wanted to clarify something for Mrs Schreyer .
As for the Council , I would like to thank it .
That you intervened is a first .
Mr President , the Council is often asked to intervene during debates in Parliament .
It rarely does so and I would like to thank the Council for intervening on this occasion .
Thank you , Mr van Hulten .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Compulsory safety belts
This is an important issue .
We are talking about around 42,000 people a year .
The most common cause of death among children and young people is traffic accidents .
My answer is yes .
I think it is very important .
Firstly , it has a legal basis in the Treaty of Rome .
We know that safety belts save lives .
This is particularly the case regarding children .
There is therefore a need for such a system .
In addition , traffic in Europe today is , to a very large extent , transboundary .
People travel in private cars , but also in commercial vehicles .
Private and commercial motoring is increasing across borders , as we have seen in a report today .
All these are good proposals .
The committee agrees that these should also be put forward as Parliament ' s proposals .
However , we propose six amendments .
I am thinking of the use of restraint systems for very small children .
More details would be taking us too far here .
Tremendous progress has been made in road traffic safety .
Today we are already talking about the need to adapt that directive to scientific and technical progress .
The latter point in particular makes it more likely that the restraint systems fitted will actually be used .
Development work is continuing .
That is where these systems fail .
I recommend acceptance of the amendments before us today for adapting the directive .
We now believe that to be unnecessary .
Ladies and gentlemen , I will now refer to specific amendments .
Parliament thanks the Commission .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Equal treatment for men and women
The directive under discussion today took on its original form as early as 1976 .
We are now facing entirely new challenges which we must tackle through legislation .
Maternity protection also needs strengthening .
We would like to put a stop to this once and for all .
This is sexual discrimination , which is banned .
In this way , we will be able to head towards real equality .
One example of this is the recruitment of over-qualified people for less high-powered jobs .
The Structural Funds must provide an incentive to the social partners to adopt agreements on equality .
( The President cut the speaker off )
The Commission braced itself for the task .
I have tried to make people see reason , but I have been only partially successful .
In particular I regret those amendments , which disregard Article 141 of the Treaty .
I regret the amendments that introduce so-called definitions .
( The President cut the speaker off )
You can count on my group at any rate .
A great deal has already changed , including in my own country , the Netherlands .
Mr President , sexual harassment at work must be outlawed .
It is terribly difficult to combat .
Victims feel they are alone .
But of course the saying " prevention is better than cure " applies here too .
Hence our amendment .
My understanding was that there is now a pact on the matter .
Employment among women decreases according to the number of children that they have .
Once the day comes when these objectives have been achieved , the other inequalities will also have disappeared .
The challenge of equality is above all the challenge of employment .
I would like to point out that reality is often ahead of legislation .
We have talked a great deal about sexual harassment .
We have also talked about paternity leave .
Working life is part of life , not all of it .
This is true for both women and men , as well as for children .
I hope that the vast majority will back Mrs Hautala ' s proposal .
Mr President , Mrs Hautala , no one can be against equality between men and women .
This special nature leads to a complementary relationship between men and women , rather than rivalry .
So much for equality !
Who are these associations ?
What exactly are we envisaging for the future ?
We cannot separate women ' s rights from the recognition of woman ' s special nature .
Our society is aspiring towards a new feminism .
We are women , wives and mothers .
Man can never be the sole reference for the development of the human being .
We put forward practical definitions of direct and indirect discrimination in the workplace .
We are again tabling an amendment to protect fathers who apply for parental leave as well .
They are still few in number .
I hope that this proposed amendment will be widely supported by this House .
In my view , this too is an essential building block for the gender mainstreaming process .
I think that this too will encourage debate about this particular issue in Germany .
I think this is excellent .
The conduct of this municipality is certainly a breach of the future provisions .
The example shows the need for the new directives .
The legislation would provide protection for them .
How can we achieve equality without laws ?
I have never known that to happen throughout the entire history of the human race .
I have to say that this work has produced some important results .
Why are they important ?
It is the most well-known in all our Member States .
It is time that the various directives were combined , and restructured together .
Why is this directive so important ?
It is also important for those countries which are candidates for EU enlargement .
I hope that our Member States will also be equal to the task that we are proposing here today .
It enhances the protection for employees who file complaints about discrimination .
Women who bear children enjoy special protection in law .
The European directive on maternity protection contains clear provisions here .
I do not oppose the inclusion of fathers , quite the contrary .
There is one minor difference .
Children are born to mothers , not fathers .
By the very nature of things , we must therefore be able to differentiate .
In this respect , the proposal is not very well thought out .
Today we are dealing with the necessary revision of this directive .
It is doubtful whether the present revision operation will be able to contribute to this aim .
My third question to the Commissioner relates to the area in which the equal-treatment legislation will be applied .
This also cries out for further equality .
This is , after all , what all the judgements have shown .
After all , equality is one of the areas in which the EU still leads the field .
Women still suffer discrimination in the labour market .
Women still earn less than men .
Women are under-represented in senior management .
Mrs Hautala 's report is an important contribution to equal opportunities .
The proposed reform does not go far enough .
For example , it fails to provide regulations on equal employment conditions for women .
Women must have equal pay for work of equal value !
We need targeted re-integration measures after career breaks .
I urge the Council and the Commission to adopt measures to achieve these objectives .
Mrs Van der Laan , my sentiments are shared by many other women in the Christian-Democrat group .
Another problem , Mr President , is sexual harassment .
This occurs more frequently than we would like in work situations .
The report makes proposals on combating and preventing such intimidation .
I pointed out at that time the important role of confidants .
I also argued for an independent body to deal with complaints .
I support the amendments that would facilitate this .
I believe that we can provide a good impetus and at the same time make acceptable demands on employers .
It is therefore necessary and useful that legislators should now act .
I believe that the sanctioning approach of the European Commission is good , but perhaps insufficient .
I consider that a good approach that can be safely followed in Europe .
Mr President , I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Hautala on this report .
Today ' s legislation sets a new milestone .
It is better to tackle this problem now .
I should like to express my annoyance at the fuss just made by Mrs Van der Laan .
In conclusion , discrimination is often connected with gender .
I wonder if we should not provide one .
I congratulate everyone on this , especially Mrs Hautala .
Mr President , my congratulations to the Commission and to the rapporteur .
I introduced that in my own country .
Secondly , positive action .
That also remains a very difficult matter , even with women .
Thirdly , equal pay .
Numerous ways have been found of getting round equal pay .
Take the example of equal pay .
But it does not happen in boom times either .
Then I would like to say something briefly about sexual harassment .
I must say that it actually works quite well and is also supported by the social partners .
I find Amendment No 25 to be particularly welcome and well-justified .
Sexual harassment is a repugnant phenomenon .
Sexual harassment , this subject on which silence has reigned for so long , must be efficiently tackled .
A text worded clearly , accurately and in detail is one of these .
We must modernise the existing legislation and adapt and adjust it to a world of change .
I would like to briefly answer some of the questions put .
We are committed to doing that and proposals will be made next year .
As far as sexual harassment is concerned , we have accepted as many of the proposals as possible .
The Commission can only accept this in cases of approval or consent of the complainant .
The Commission never intended such a ban .
This would be unrealistic and over-complicated .
This would be incompatible with the wording of the Treaty .
This is the major issue ; it is not a question of political differences or an ideological problem .
The Commission can accept the latter wording .
Such a provision cannot be contained in a directive , which does not go beyond these fields .
But as I have already said , we are going to propose measures in 2002 .
This goes beyond the scope of the directive .
We are going to issue a communication and support and encourage Member States to take this into account .
Finally , as you can see , the Commission can accept most of Parliament 's amendments .
I would like to congratulate you .
Thank you , Mrs Diamantopoulou .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Integrated European labour market 1998-1999
Few people understand what EURES could mean for the future .
EURES covers not only the Union , but also the European Economic Area and currently includes 17 countries .
All of this makes little sense , however , if people are fundamentally unaware of its existence .
The first priority is , therefore , to promote and to publicise this programme .
In our opinion , the Commission ' s report itself contains some shortcomings , which we have highlighted .
We agree with all the key points contained in Mr Ribeiro e Castro 's report .
I should also like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his competent work .
This will also make our job easier .
It is not at all easy to be mobile in a cross-border way in the European labour market .
I believe that policy-makers should make more use of their know-how and expertise .
The Commission has formulated a number of proposals and the honourable Member has supplemented these in a useful way .
I also think it is important that there is better coordination with other Community initiatives .
But I should like to put special emphasis on two additional elements .
I should like to ask you again to give this serious consideration .
That will not be easy while decisions on this issue must be made unanimously .
The EURES network provides a very valuable resource for potential mobile workers .
It also provides a valuable , if underused , resource for employers .
Many small and medium-sized enterprises do not have the capacity or experience to carry out their cross-border recruitment .
We must also recognise that enlargement will bring additional and quite legitimate demands in terms of information .
There is also the question about dealing with tax problems for frontier workers .
I would like to add two comments .
I hope that it will never be possible to implement any such measure at European level .
This is just another example of the many qualitative examples of the EU at work for citizens .
Membership of the European Union has brought enormous benefits to Ireland .
The fact that we have come close to full employment is a practical example of what is achievable .
Let us not forget their courage and sacrifice in safeguarding freedom and democracy .
This objective surely outweighs other minor or contrived objections to Nice .
Yesterday evening , I logged on to the website and there were 7 197 vacancies listed .
Looking at the first 200 vacancies , the range of jobs is extensive .
Firstly , the rapporteur requires more information on the results of the EURES network .
My third point concerns the necessary subsidiarity .
However , local information is the responsibility of the local players .
On the other hand , I can fully support the call for decentralisation .
The term of the budget is also a discussion point .
The Commission wants a budget extending over several years as this facilitates planning .
That leads me to prefer an annual establishment of the budget .
In conclusion the attention paid by the rapporteur to expansion has my support .
Having said this , we must not overestimate the value of EURES .
Like previous speakers , I should like to emphasise the value of the activity report .
It seems to me that there are three points which need emphasising .
First there is the issue of mobility , which has already been mentioned .
Finally , I should like to end my speech by mentioning the question of enlargement .
However , there is clearly more to it than that .
EURES is instrumental to the creation of this European labour market .
Thank you , Mrs Diamantopoulou .
The debate is closed .

On the subject of Amendment No 70
I have to obtain the assent of Parliament before putting Amendment No 70 to the vote .
Nor does the Commissioner agree with them , as she has told us .
Unfortunately , however , there is no separate vote on a compromise amendment .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mrs Lulling , are you opposing the vote on this amendment or not ?
( FR ) In the circumstances , yes .
Very well , you are familiar with the Rules of Procedure .
I shall ask Parliament whether it wishes this compromise amendment to be taken into consideration .

On the subject of Amendment No 71
Is there any opposition to taking this oral amendment into consideration ?

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Schörling Report ( A5-0177 / 2001 )
Among the members elected to the Chamber of Deputies is Mr Fatuzzo .
You will think it is me , Mr President , but it is not me .
So vote for it ! '
Roo Report ( A5-0178 / 2001 )
Mr President , Mr de Roo has presented the directive on tyre regulation .
' Really ? ' I answered .
' How have you come to understand that ? '
' Well , Mr de Roo has a very obvious surname : he is called R-o-o .
Don ' t you see ?
In his name there are tyres and wheels .
Nobody else could discuss this report as well as he could . '
I know Mr de Roo will forgive me as he is a very nice man .
Méndez de Vigo / Seguro Report ( A5-0168 / 2001 )
At home they say one thing and out here they do something very different .
We need a Constitution , a Parliament , a European Government and a President elected by the people .
If we want a Europe we should also have European parties .
In particular , the following are worthy of note :
the loosening up of procedures , making it possible to engage in enhanced cooperation ;
Thus the ratification of the Treaty of Nice is regarded as a fait accompli .
We are not even discussing it .
Some provisions even contradict it openly .
This quality should not be underestimated .
This constitutional process would have to result in the adoption of an EU Constitution .
The debate is underway .
. I was present but did not participate in this vote .
I wish to put on the record my support for the Treaty of Nice .
The role of the national parliaments must be strengthened in decision-making in Europe .
We further protest against the militarisation of the EU .
We now come to the question of the container .
The Treaty of Nice is diametrically opposed to this approach , as are the policies proposed by this report .
This is why I have voted against .
( Speech was cut short pursuant to Article 137 of the Rules of Procedure )
Nice makes the European labyrinth no less impenetrable and more durable .
The rapporteur does not offer that alternative .
Therefore I myself and a large section of my group will be voting against .
This resolution acknowledges that the last remaining institutional obstacles to enlargement have been removed and we welcome that .
How will this point be received by Estonia , Poland and Cyprus , for example ?
This is now also the common view of Parliament as a whole .
The second proposal is about applying and refining the principle of subsidiarity .
There is no single European people , but a great many .
There is no single European mother tongue , but a great many .
There is no single European nation , but a great many .
There is no single European culture , but a great many .
As always , European integration is proceeding by a series of tests and necessary measures .
Is it to be a powerful Europe or a club of countries paralysed by the rule of consensus ?
Sadly the Christian foundations and heritage of the European Union are conspicuous by their absence from the Charter .
The Treaty of Nice therefore fits in perfectly well with the ideological approach of its predecessors .
( Speech was cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure )
Any new European plan will have to be accompanied by a radical transformation in the thinking behind the CAP .
Myller Report ( A5-175 / 2001 )
However , here in Parliament many amendments have been introduced .
As a group , we cannot accept any of them .
However , we find that measures have been introduced which are impossible for citizens to comply with .
The level has been raised so high that it is impossible even for the enlargement countries to achieve it .
We think that we need to govern with our heads and with a spirit of solidarity towards the citizens .
It would be crazy what the people would have to do if these measures had to be applied .
For all these reasons , I abstained in the vote .
In our conversations they have expressed a doubt , a problem .
The young , the middle-aged , the old ? '
This is why we support the general objectives of the Myller report .
We cannot answer for the replacement of production aids .
We wish to continue that work , but not in an insidious manner .
Changes in direction are now possible and desirable .
Ten years after the crucial Rio de Janeiro Summit , expectations have not been met .
The Community ' s Fifth Environment Action Programme protects people from the adverse effects of air pollution .
Ten years after the crucial Rio de Janeiro Summit , expectations have not been met .
Governments ( European , national , regional and local ) are also called upon to integrate these considerations .
Businesses have a major share of responsibility for the current problems .
One of our priorities must continue to be making the public at large more aware .
I voted against .
The report that we are voting on today will cause difficulties .
This applies in the case of environmental responsibility .
The contrast is striking , and it is not difficult to understand .
I do not think so .
I certainly would not !
However , it would seem essential to revise this ten-year-old text .
The use of child restraint systems must therefore be further harmonised and made more certain .
This proposal , though satisfactory , is not sufficiently precise .
That is why the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism wanted to provide additional details .
This applies especially to the use of child restraint systems .
All the existing exemptions for restraint systems , in particular for children , are eliminated .
Better information to be supplied to the public .
Despite the omission of important points such as
attachments for child restraint systems to be fitted as standard in all vehicles ,
detection systems to be introduced to indicate whether the front passenger airbag has been deactivated ,
my group fully supports the report .
This will make safety belt systems compulsory in cars up to 3.5 tons .
My group is gratified that her amendments have been adopted .
" Smart " airbags might be a solution .
As a result the regulation will become more transparent and more predictable .
Problems in intracommunal traffic will be solved because legislation in the Member States will be brought into line .
It is a shared competence based on Article 251 of the Treaty .
Hautala Report ( A5-173 / 2001 )
A legislative text must be capable of implementation .
Mr President , I voted for this report .
In fact , I am in favour of all measures that bring equality of treatment between men and women .
In the newly elected Italian Parliament , the number of women has fallen : thus we are going backwards .
I now want to appeal to Mr Berlusconi , who will head the Italian government .
Mr Berlusconi , is it really true that there will be no women ministers in the new Italian government ?
I hope not !
Why , you may ask .
Europe ought to have more money . '
Clearly , Mr Fatuzzo , not everyone can vote here .
This is why we have voted in favour of the report .
Is that what we want ?
It was with reference to real equality that we supported the Hautala report .
Dell 'Alba Report ( A5-0176 / 2001 )
. I supported Amendments Nos 14 and 179 of the above report .
( Speech was cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure )
Blokland Report ( A5-172 / 2001 )
I was thinking about this yesterday while on the plane from Rome to Brussels .
I had a dreadful ten minutes , Mr President .
Long live Mr Blokland !
Naturally , I voted for the motion .
To be honest , your diary is much more flexible than the President ' s .
Hulthén Report ( A5-171 / 2001 )
She said to me , ' But why on earth should the future survival of mankind interest me ?
I am 88 years old : my future is today .
The environmental aspect still ends up playing the Cinderella role .
This situation is clearly reflected in the reports tabled before the European Parliament .
We cannot count on it .
So far , a figure of only 8 % has been agreed
The Fifteen know what is at stake .
Ribeiro e Castro Report ( A5-168 / 2001 )
But what does voluntary mean ?
There is still much more work migration in America than in Europe .
It is much better to bring work to people that to take people to work .
Parliament has completed its agenda .
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
( The sitting was closed at 1.50 p.m. )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament which was adjourned on Thursday , 31 May 2001 .
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of Thursday 31 May 2001 have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I have a comment about the Minutes .
Of course , Mr Ferber , we shall certainly check this .
( The Minutes were approved )
I have no requests for amendments to Monday or Tuesday 's agendas .
Relating to Wednesday :
None of you wanted this last week .
Thank you , Mr Barón Crespo .
Mr Poettering presented the request and Mrs Hautala has spoken against it .
A speaker in favour of the request will now take the floor , since Mr Poettering tabled it .
Mr Barón Crespo in its favour , as long as the debate is placed on July ' s agenda .
This means , then , that there are two speakers in favour of postponing the debate .
Madam President , let me make an alternative suggestion .
This is completely possible .
We have the whole morning for these two discussions .
Mr Gollnisch will now speak in favour of postponing the report .
Madam President , thank you very much .
( Parliament gave its assent )
I believe that this is the terminology that we should use in our internal work .
Madam President , I have another question regarding Wednesday .
We are on the way to a five-day Wednesday !
We might as well start at midnight on Tuesday and work right through until 8.30 a.m.
I would like to know why this is the case .
I have no requests for amendments to Thursday 's agenda .
The order of business is thus established .
Speeches relating to procedure :
Nice resulted in too little democracy and failed to create a sound basis for enlargement .
Europe 's citizens would not understand if we shirked this issue at this time .
I therefore believe that this is a satisfactory outcome for you .
Mr Bonde , I would , in any event , refer you to the Rules of Procedure .
The Irish people are a generous people .
It was a decision made in good faith .
The will of the Irish people must be respected .
We should not rush into a debate .
It is time for reflection and analysis .
Clarification is undoubtedly necessary .
Let there be no ambiguity : the Irish people are a generous people .
They have a social conscience and favour enlargement .
The Irish people will resolve their own problems .
Madam President , my point also concerns the Irish referendum .
Will he now join me in voting to go with the euro ?
( Laughter and applause ) I extend the hand of friendship to Roger .
I welcome his conversion .
The tóraidhe were Anglo-Irish people who were expelled from their land on account of their religion .
They refused to go and were loyal to the king .
I hope that Roger is enlightened now .
I certainly hope that we have bridged the gap between us .
I believe we are different .
We have a slightly different culture and a very different history .
Yet we are the same as everybody else here .
We have good people and bad people .
We accept democracy nevertheless , because it is the only way .
Thank you , Mr McCartin .
I shall therefore give him the floor once again .
It was the one key issue where the public were definitely and clearly on our side .
So put that one in your pipe and smoke it !
Madam President , I rise on a point of order concerning my friend Roger Helmer .
Mr McCartin pointed out quite rightly that Mr Helmer had no understanding of history .
( Laughter and applause )
Madam President , allow me a final remark on Ireland .
I look forward to asking them on Wednesday what it is they want .
Do they want to weaken Ireland the same way they weakened Denmark ten years ago ?
I warn against that .
That is the result that we would all have liked .
I intend to speak in our common language .
The participation rate in Ireland corresponds very well to the participation rate in elections to the European Parliament .
In complete contrast to my good fellow Member , Mr Haarder , I would gladly recommend the Danish model .
Madam President , I rise under Rule 174 , the right to petition the European Parliament .
Thank you , Mr Perry .
I shall , of course , take note of what you have said .
We have campaigned at Senate and Congress level in all manner of ways .
That is why our protest against the death penalty is crucial .
Madam President , I am sorry , but something seems to have got lost in translation .
My question was very precise .
That was my question .
Yes , that was why .
Your comments have been noted .
If so , have you already forwarded this documentation to the committee responsible ?
This is not the case at all .
The Supreme Court subsequently sent further documents , and they were again sent directly to me .
This is clear .
As you see , therefore , we are keeping a close eye on the progress made in this matter .
Madam President , thank you for permitting me to rise again .
This is an absurd situation for which I hold you , Mrs Fontaine , entirely responsible .
Mr Schulz , I am sure that Mr Dell ' Utri will listen carefully to your concerns .
Thank you , Mr Alyssandrakis .
I would like to bring up two points .
First of all , the death penalty .
We are opposed to the execution of Timothy McVeigh , even though he is a murderer .
This should be pointed out .
There is no good or bad use of the death penalty .
Even the lowest of the low do not deserve to be killed in this way .
I would like the European Parliament to adopt this position .
Sexual exploitation of children - Trafficking in human beings
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
In my opinion , the Commission 's proposal should be viewed positively .
In my view , victim protection is especially important .
They should therefore be our priority , and they deserve our greatest possible support .
With the support of the European Parliament , all these points should be included in the draft before us .
Mr President , I too should like to congratulate Mrs Karamanou on this report .
We must tackle the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography across the EU .
We must make sure that we stamp that out .
I also wanted to bring in children with learning difficulties .
But we must make sure that photographs of naked children are caught in that net .
Both are on the increase .
We believe that various measures are necessary for this purpose .
Any form of child abuse is ruthless !
There is no such thing as ' mild ' child abuse .
Anything that happens to a child in this context is ruthless .
I am therefore in favour of raising the age limit to 16 .
Legal assistance and psychological support are very important .
Sadly , there is not enough time for further comments .
However , I would like to thank everyone who supports the work in this field .
I am very disappointed at the fact that , instead , the Palermo protocol has been watered down .
We have thus focused on the man instead of stigmatising the person who is prostituting herself .
What this does is preserve stereotypical images of women ' s and men ' s sexuality and sexual needs .
The definitions of child pornography that we adopted in the women ' s committee are much better .
We therefore have a responsibility to fight this scourge and to create the necessary legislative instruments .
The first example is penalties .
It is better to target pornography which exploits real children , not pretend ones .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Council has been too quick off the mark .
What the Council finds important , we deem inadequate and one-sided .
Where are the bottlenecks ?
Mafia groups have capitalised on the globalisation of the economy faster than anyone else .
A second bottleneck is the rift between rich and poor regions ; and then there is poverty .
And where is development cooperation in this respect ?
I should also like to say : do not overlook corruption .
In my view , it is not sufficient to mention trafficking in human beings alone .
The clarification regarding women and children was proposed at Palermo .
I would like to thank the various committees and rapporteurs for having insisted on this .
These additions affect at least three points .
That means incitement and not just fraud .
As you can see , there is a small difference between the two concepts .
This is another important point .
That is why I believe that these reports are crucial .
I would like to thank the two rapporteurs .
How can we combat trafficking if there is no cooperation between Member States ?
Does this proposal allow for sufficient cooperation ?
Both men and women can be victims , but the main victims are women , especially , and children .
Mr President , this is a very important report and a significant step forward .
Like the rest of the House , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report .
In my view this is compatible with the Convention of the Rights of the Child .
None of our countries can claim to be free of these threats .
None of our countries can halt these acts on their own .
The European Union has not been ignoring this worrying phenomenon .
Finally , I fully support the compromise agreement reached by our committee on Article 5 ( 4 ) .
International criminal organisations are ruthless and act with extreme effrontery .
I sincerely hope that their compassionate proposals can stand the test of legislation .
However , I share Mrs Ludford ' s doubts .
I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino would like to expand on this matter .
Any hesitation or weakening in the policy should therefore be firmly nipped in the bud .
We should never have let things get this far .
This is the first factor .
The second factor is contempt towards children .
We should not be surprised that there is no rhyme or reason to this aspect of our civilisation .
I would also like to bring up the method which has been used in the report .
The Commission text was written in sufficiently general terms so that all types of criminality could be included .
We added to them .
In some areas , has the wording of the report not been made more cumbersome than is necessary ?
In such cases , the Member State must , nonetheless , take steps .
What is meant exactly by the term ' requirement of double criminality ' ?
I believe that we should revise the wording of this point .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would , however , give you a warning as regards the Internet .
It is difficult to ask for the impossible .
We hope that , in this way , the report will contribute to eradicating this despicable phenomenon .
I should like to congratulate both our colleagues on their excellent reports .
Yet it remains an absolute disgrace that this man has not yet been brought to justice .
I should like to make a few technical remarks about the report .
They can do this purely to avoid criminal sanctions .
This also presents a considerable obstacle to developing common standards and comparative data protection .
We reject this because any abuse of children is a criminal offence .
I do not think we can believe that .
What measures ?
Finally , I should like to comment on Mrs Karamanou ' s report on child pornography .
I am therefore seriously considering abstaining from voting on this matter .
Indeed , censoring fantasy is taking things too far in our view .
These problems can no longer be resolved through national measures .
The European Union and its Member States must adopt a joint approach in cooperation with the third countries concerned .
The United Nations estimates that worldwide , around 200 million people are exploited as slaves .
Trafficking in human beings is conducted via well-organised criminal and in some cases international networks .
The Framework Decision is an important step towards better cooperation between Member States .
All the preventive options must be expanded further .
These problems must be considered in the accession negotiations with the Central and East European countries .
Mr President , 140 years ago , slavery was abolished in the USA and Russia .
Now , it has been introduced into Europe .
Few perpetrators are brought before the courts and even fewer are sentenced .
It is essential to achieve a harmonisation of the legislation and to increase the penalties .
We are dealing with an extremely sensitive issue , an issue that is of fundamental importance to our society .
A whole series of personal and interpersonal relationships have been greatly disturbed .
We should think carefully about the decisions we take as a European Parliament .
The European Parliament synthesises the tensions present in society .
It is also right that we should discuss the maximum penalties .
I support the proposals put forward in the report .
A society 's condemnation of a crime is reflected to a substantial extent in the minimum penalties it applies .
However , child pornography is certainly not a crime where a suspended sentence is appropriate .
I would like to start with Mrs Klamt 's report .
However , prevention is only one side of the coin .
Providing victims with assistance and protection is equally important .
That decision addresses several important issues taken up in some of Parliament 's amendments .
It can also support the amendments on transportation in inhuman conditions as an aggravated circumstance .
The Commission has not , therefore , submitted a revised proposal .
We will await Parliament 's opinions and then incorporate them into our own position .
Let me now turn to Mrs Karamanou 's report .
Coherence between these two instruments is , in my opinion , extremely important .
The Commission cannot therefore agree to the suggested amendments .
At the same time , we are willing to consider these issues in a broader context .
That is true .
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on animal welfare .
It also provides us with the opportunity to exchange thoughts on these important matters .
Man ' s relationship with animals is increasingly a matter of discussion in today ' s society .
In this respect , the year 1995 is not like the year 2001 .
How animals are treated is also a matter of people ' s attitudes and values .
All the Member States felt that the ethical aspects of livestock farming are important .
These must be integrated to a greater extent into future decisions concerning livestock farming .
The Member States pointed out that animals are sentient beings that must be treated well .
They must be treated with respect , and consideration is to be given to their health and welfare .
I think it is important to note one of the conference ' s conclusions in particular .
Improved animal welfare which guarantees healthier animals often has crucial economic benefits .
Here , it was clear that changes must take place .
In their contributions , many of my colleagues highlighted the crisis that agriculture is currently in .
For example , it is important that provisions that are adopted are also implemented in practice .
The report was presented and discussed at the Council of Ministers in January .
It is also important for the Commission to come up with concrete proposals for improvements in the legislation .
It is important to implement the common decisions that we have taken in each country .
Fortunately enough , during the latter part of this spring the Commission submitted a proposal within this area .
The Presidency has initiated discussion of the proposal in the Council ' s working party .
As you already know , the proposal involves improved conditions for pigs .
We very much appreciate the rapporteur ' s , Mr Busk ' s , work on this proposal .
This of course requires an opinion from the European Parliament .
Within the EU , we have decided that we must take animals ' needs into consideration .
Naturally , we will continue to show consideration for animals because our legislation demands it .
Moreover , it is my personal conviction that our human dignity bids us accept our responsibility for animals .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Swedish Presidency for taking the initiative to request this debate .
I was pleased to represent the Commission in all these debates and discussions .
This discussion is intended to lead to a resolution helping to set the future policy agenda .
I am satisfied that this is not the case .
These discussions are genuinely worthwhile .
This is changing fast .
Moreover , I am convinced that it will become even more important in the future .
The reason for the higher profile of this issue is not hard to see .
People care deeply about the treatment of animals .
These sentiments are also feeding into the market .
It makes good business sense to respond to these demands .
These trends will continue to grow and there is no reason why they cannot be accommodated .
The Commission strongly supports this initiative and intends to actively participate in this future development .
This House is , of course , very aware of these concerns .
A disproportionate number of written and oral questions to the Commission are also on this subject .
It is our duty and responsibility to reflect on these concerns .
I would like , however , to sound a word of caution on a number of fronts .
I spoke at length on this in Stockholm recently .
The Commission can ultimately only play a subsidiary role in relation to animal welfare .
Certainly , within our area of competence , we must take our responsibilities very seriously .
In addition , Member States are responsible for the day-to-day enforcement of Community legislation in this field .
A second qualification relates to the role of farmers and the livestock industry in general .
This is unfair , untrue and counterproductive .
The vast majority clearly treat their animals in a good and humane manner .
I know where I stand on this : work with the farmers .
Turning to more general issues , I would like to signal some clear Commission orientations .
First , animal welfare questions need to be integrated more fully into food policy .
I reject the argument that animal welfare has nothing to do with food safety .
Second , there is the need for further Community actions .
The presidency is very anxious to reach final agreement on this proposal .
That would provide a very positive signal of Parliament 's own commitment to animal welfare .
There is a common misconception that this is a protectionist agenda .
This is unfair .
Europe is progressively implementing higher welfare standards .
These are legitimate issues which deserve to be discussed on the international stage .
Finally , the Commission will continue to press for improved respect of existing Community legislation .
This is just a brief outline of a complex and sensitive issue .
Thank you for your attention and I look forward to hearing your views on the issue .
The consumers and the animal rights activists do not understand why there is still a need for it .
How are the animals transported ?
This has been discussed for many years at European level , so it is not a new issue .
We have already produced vast quantities of papers and resolutions .
Why , then , are we making such slow progress ?
In its report , the Commission emphasises its plans to improve the implementation of existing legislation .
I greatly welcome this statement .
I am in favour of animal welfare , and let me assure you that farmers are too .
They have been for decades - in their animal husbandry , breeding and transport .
Mr Byrne , thank you very much for stating this so clearly today .
Given the great many directives in force , this diverges widely in the Member States .
Sadly , animal welfare is not understood the same way everywhere .
Laws are one thing ; the actual treatment of , and attitude towards , animals are another .
The responsibility for animals as living creatures falls exclusively on humans .
Animal welfare also has an impact on farms ' competitiveness , however .
Viable solutions must be devised .
Mr President , the treatment of animals is a question of civilisation .
Pets are cherished , but cattle is often still treated abominably .
Intensive cattle farming has elevated animal abuse to a methodology .
The policy is unilaterally focused on cheap production .
Drastic improvements are required in terms of their accommodation .
For example , pigs and calves must be kept in groups and must be given plenty of straw .
The castration of pigs , bobtailing and the cutting of teeth must be banned .
Laying hens must be kept exclusively in spacious , free-range bird houses .
The artificial , fast-track breeding of chicks and turkeys must be discontinued .
Long hauls with live cattle must be abolished .
In my view , four hours , or 250 km , are the maximum .
The inspection of cattle transports must be tightened considerably .
International trade should be conducted in meat and not in live animals .
Proper slaughterhouses must be set up everywhere , so as to restrict transport .
Cattle markets must be abolished .
Until such time , animals will suffer , and people will suffer from a lack of civilisation .
Mr President , I also welcome the statements from both the Council and the Commission .
I welcome all the statements concerning this issue of the protection of animals and animal welfare .
This is therefore progress .
Animal ethics is about much more than mere rules .
It is about attitudes and knowledge of animals and about how animals must feel well .
However , there is no functioning supervisory apparatus .
Now we have been given an answer from the Commission to the question that I put .
The Council too has also stated that the transport of live animals must cease ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , there is a well-known saying that well-being is more important than welfare .
We welcome initiatives which considerably restrict the transport of live cattle .
In that connection , I consider breaks in the journey to be a stopgap .
The maximum period of transport for live animals should make these redundant .
This was due to European directives which , in principle , prescribe a slaughter policy without vaccination .
I should like to persuade the Commissioner and the Council to repeal the non-vaccination policy .
I would concur with the remark made by my colleague , Mrs Keppelhoff , on that point .
Animal welfare is still too often an element in the distortion of competition among the Member States .
Animals are not merely products , nor are they simply commodities .
I take them around .
I trade them here , I trade them there . "
They are not stocks and shares .
They are not speculative metals .
They are sentient creatures .
The Food Safety Authority will need to address this matter .
It will certainly have our support .
Those things seem to me to be enormously important .
More specifically , I should like to talk about the transport of live animals .
I have asked you a question in this connection .
Meat can be transported over long distances ; animals cannot .
That is my guiding principle .
You stated that you need to monitor this long-haul transport in the Member States .
It is evident that the means are desperately lacking .
That translates into less than five percent of the inspection assignments .
You will understand that we are not satisfied with this .
In my view , some progress has already been made in the past .
This figure is wrong .
However , when he is at the counter buying his steak , he has a rather different view .
This is a very important point .
This brings us to issues of education and training within the family .
In other words , a very wide sphere of activity must be included .
Animals can be healthy even without these conditions , as we know from practical experience .
I hope that this will take us a further step towards better animal welfare in Europe .
Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert asked the very important question - not why , but how .
For example , why do we dispatch animals to third countries ?
Why do we send calves from Sweden to Holland ?
Clearly there is an answer to these questions .
Young calves are sent from Sweden to Holland , for example , because it is more profitable .
In Holland , they are reared by a different method than in Sweden .
We must also ask whether all this transportation really has to take place .
A number of speakers have mentioned the matter of price .
Someone has to pay . The question is simply : who ?
Who is to pay for animal welfare ?
Who is to pay for the countryside ?
Who is to pay for the wetlands , for biodiversity , and so on ?
Mr Kindermann spoke about the responsibility that man has .
I share this opinion .
We have a special responsibility for these matters precisely due to our status as human beings .
We have a special position in respect of animals and it is only we who can accept that responsibility .
Mr van den Bos provided the most far-reaching contribution of any of us here .
These things do not come about of their own accord .
In other words , we would then also have to reject all types of export subsidies for these animals .
Mrs Schörling , like several others , spoke about supervision .
The Commission has a responsibility to ensure that supervision in the various countries is good .
It does so through the office in Dublin .
Mr van Dam spoke of the restrictions on live animals , and I share his opinion .
Unfortunately , in the report , animals are defined as commodities .
Mr Maat talked about vaccination and exports .
Allow me to argue that it is not just because of exports that we have this non-vaccination policy .
We have not yet got that far , but research is in progress .
This conference will hopefully be held during the autumn .
Mr Whitehead spoke about the fact that animals are not just products and commodities .
In this respect , I refer to my earlier answer - animals are sentient beings .
He also addressed the matter of chemicals policy .
I think this is a very good ambition .
Mrs Maes spoke about the inspection trips .
Mr Schnellhardt gave the example of chickens and said that we had achieved something .
Yes , we have achieved something , but there still remains such an incredible amount to do .
He does not believe that people are prepared to pay .
No , perhaps they are not prepared to pay through higher prices .
This takes us back to the relationship between animal welfare and cost .
We have a moral responsibility to treat animals well .
Cruelty to animals is unworthy of us humans .
Let me deal with a number of the individual issues that were raised by many of you .
First of all , there is the question of animal transport .
Some people made the point that carcass transport should replace live animal transport .
This issue will be considered in the light of the advice given to us by the Scientific Committee .
Another issue of considerable concern is the loading and unloading of animals .
It is an issue of particular complexity .
The vaccination administered is effective for only six to nine months .
At present such a distinction cannot be made once a vaccination has been administered .
This is not an unreasonable apprehension .
They apply equally to exportation out of the European Union as they do to importation within the European Union .
The opening of infringement proceedings against Italy is also being considered .
I have given instructions to my staff to pay close attention to this issue .
The group intends to visit all the Member States to discuss these issues .
Many of the questions that were raised in that Internet chat were directed at the issue of animal welfare .
I fully agree .
Information and communication technologies in developing countries
The gap between the world ' s rich and poor has grown .
It is slightly better in the case of the EU , where it is 0.34 % .
In addition to this , there is ICT .
This is a necessary but not a sufficient condition .
This report therefore contains a proposal for an e-development unit .
There is also a need for private enterprises .
A similar commitment within ICT is imperative .
There are some that are in progress and more should be given further impetus .
Finally , Mr President : ICT is always emphasised as the technology that can liberate people .
It would be nice to be able to see that that also applies to people in the developing countries .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Europe goes online .
But what about ' e-development ' ?
Of course , it would be wrong to raise false hopes by presenting ICT as a panacea .
This requires a targeted strategy .
The purpose of the report before us is to remedy this situation .
I am confident that we will be able to engage in fruitful dialogue with the Commission on these issues .
New information technologies can also strengthen the links between the people and the state .
At first glance , the answer is no .
After all , the fight against poverty is the main issue .
If one fights for one ' s daily bread , one will not be concerned with e-mail .
That should not happen .
That is why a European strategy must be developed .
Mrs Dybkjær has drafted an excellent report on this matter .
The public and private sectors are both crucial in this .
The government is vital for drafting sound legislation , for administrative guidance and promotion .
In addition , ICT can contribute to better environmental management and to saving energy .
But nevertheless , he states it is a necessity if the countries want to be able to compete .
This is a realistic approach .
For the Commission , this is a fundamental point .
Mrs Dybkjær 's report is well timed .
The Commission , for its part , is preparing a communication , to be submitted later in the year .
We have some difficulties , however , with the proposal to widen the development priority areas .
This proposal would run counter to it .
The Commission has to focus its activities if it wants to deliver on its aid agenda .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon .
Export and return of cultural goods
We can , however , draw certain conclusions .
She has sufficient capacity and resources for this not to be the case .
We also face other problems , however .
Every nation ' s cultural heritage is of undeniable importance to national identity and to European identity .
There must be closer police and judicial cooperation in this field between Member States .
It is evident that the cultural heritage of the country visited suffered damaged as a result of that .
It is therefore to be welcomed that Europe is curtailing this practice .
The important role which trade is playing in this cannot be underestimated .
It is obvious that a universally accessible digital network at European level would be priceless .
We need to start in Europe , however .
I am pleased to say that the Netherlands has already taken a step in the right direction .
The Commission is devoting particular attention to this question in the enlargement negotiations .
The Commission would like to ask Parliament to give its backing to those moves .
Perhaps I may give some examples of initiatives launched by the Commission .
Secondly , the launch of a study on the traceability of cultural objects .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon .
( The sitting was closed at 8.55 p.m. )
I must start with a regrettable announcement .
There is no alternative , I am sorry to say .
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Mr President , I would like to say that I was here yesterday .
Mr Sacrédeus , our services will find out how that is supposed to be handled .
I would like to see these included .
We have taken note of that too .
Mr President , I raised the matter of Question Time yesterday .
I checked this out .
Mr Kinnock received only one question , yet his name remains on the list .
So something is very much amiss in this whole business .
That will be investigated , Mr Posselt .
( Parliament approved the Minutes )
Vote on requests for urgent procedure
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
( Parliament approved the request for urgent procedure )
Mr President , the Commission and the Council have asked for urgent procedure .
( Parliament approved the request for urgent procedure )
We did not receive early notification .
We have only had the texts since Friday .
For that reason , the matter requires due political consideration .
Accordingly , we recommend the rejection of this request .
( Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure )
European Food Authority
Mr President , this is a moment of some importance for consumer protection in the European Union .
You cannot have the one without the other .
This authority is primarily concerned with food safety .
That is why our committee strongly supported the change of title .
Everything has to be seen through this focus .
They are all there in due measure .
But they are not there in the title .
They are not in themselves the primary function of this new authority .
I owe a great debt to my colleagues of all parties in the committee .
We go for merit every time .
We go for openness .
We go for transparency .
The Member States will play a full role through the continuum of the advisory forum .
We do not think that the authority should be responsible for the rapid alert system .
We think ultimate responsibility must rest with the Commission .
The EUR 44 million envisaged is a fairly small sum , compared to other European agencies .
It is only one third of the budget which the British Food Standards Agency had at its inception .
My final point is about the site of the new authority .
My own scepticism remains .
I think we should take the traditional route , on this issue at least .
I commend this report to the House .
I hope the House will support it in the vote .
This is why we must expedite our preparatory work .
We must ensure that the Food Authority is operational at the start of next year .
The need for haste , however , must not impair the quality of the legislative groundwork .
The amendment has its origins in the Committee on Budgets .
Some agencies are still in a sorry state in this respect .
There is a desire to keep the authority independent .
This may be a noble aim , but it is unrealistic .
This means , of course , that a decision to introduce fees was not taken .
And the Authority is to present a draft budget each year .
With regard to risk assessment , it should be of a scientific and independent nature .
He has done a great job .
However , I would still like to focus attention on one particular point .
This is addressed by Amendment No 208 .
I also hope that this legislative proposal is quickly adopted and implemented .
The very nature of fisheries has implications for traceability .
It is regrettable that neither of these priorities were taken on board by the committee responsible .
I would urge the Commissioner to take them into account .
I would therefore urge the House to support these amendments .
Mr President , there are two key reasons for action in this field .
Food is a single market and food safety is a public health issue .
Keep the number to 12 .
Appoint the director of the board after open competition and a parliamentary hearing .
Account to Parliament annually for the stewardship of the remit .
Mr President , firstly I would like to congratulate Mr Whitehead , who has done an excellent job .
At the same time this has led to a focus on food and agriculture policy .
However , this must not of course mean that illnesses and disease also flow freely .
Naturally , a common system must not mean that regionally produced food is not permitted .
Possibly in the future it will also be necessary to introduce sanctions .
It is now necessary for cooperation between these two authorities to be developed .
However , this can only be addressed by the Commission .
It is important that we continue the work such that it becomes even more efficient .
The report is based on a whole set of keywords .
First of all , there is safety .
The title has been made more specific : the European Food Authority is now the European Food Safety Authority .
This immediately clarifies the key function of this new institution .
Secondly , quality .
The emphasis is placed on food production of higher quality .
Not quantity , but quality must from now on be of primary concern .
Thirdly , maintaining the cultural diversity of food within the European Union .
Local and traditional production should not fall victim to European legislation .
Fourthly , traceability , transparency of products and increasing producer liability .
Sixthly , the precautionary principle must apply to any discernible risk .
But what is a fair price for healthy food ?
I also extend my compliments to Mr Whitehead on the thoroughness of his report .
From now on every link in the food chain will become an integral part of the production process .
Europe has a rapidly growing food sector .
New research in this area will contribute significantly to its future development .
The Commission proposals concerning the development of food legislation and food safety are positive .
However , as a result of recent food crises , the European consumer has lost faith in food .
The key aim of setting up the European Food Authority is to regain that trust .
That is why it is of great importance that a link be established between food production and food safety .
The upshot will be that European agricultural policy will need a complete overhaul .
This also reduces the risk of infection .
Such a policy ties in with the prevention principle and the proximity principle .
Only in cases where this is really impossible should additional trade take place .
The political translation of risk assessment into risk management belongs with the European institutions .
And on the basis of a reliable authority , all consumers can acquire confidence in European food .
Unfortunately , that is the golden rule for the creation and proliferation of bureaucracies .
These are issues to be dealt with by the market and the Member States .
The rapid alert system should not , therefore , be placed under the control of the authority .
No specific explanation has been given on this crucial point .
This debate is clearly of major importance to the European citizen .
Mr President , I am referring to the proposals as being " long-awaited " .
The location in which the authority should be based is still to be indicated , in fact .
I expect the EP to re-confirm my amendment on that score .
They have both acquitted themselves of their tasks marvellously .
I would now like to make a few observations about the content .
I would call for further development in the future .
In conclusion , I want to mention the choice of location for the future Authority .
In voting for Amendment No 215 , therefore , we call for the co-decision procedure to be applied .
However , I do have a few comments to make .
Have we forgotten all this ?
This service is not an authority , it is a sort of intergovernmental consultancy service .
It is not a bad thing , but it does not amount to much .
In any event , it is in keeping with the intergovernmental nature of the Union .
So all this restricts the role of the service under discussion .
Despite which , it will be a valuable service .
However , I have one reservation .
The negligence of certain Member States has encouraged , if not aggravated , the impact of these disasters .
Will it be yet another European technocratic unit ?
This decision should be made immediately at the Gothenburg Summit .
These matters are important to citizens .
The authority must be independent and it must have good contacts with the scientific community .
Openness and appointments based on merit are essential .
Inspections will then be monitored by the agency based in Dublin .
There is a great deal yet to be done on that front .
We must have clear European standards and European measuring methods .
The Member States and the Union must have a common system that works .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , hats off to the rapporteur and to the shadow rapporteur !
They have worked unstintingly and single-mindedly to present this marvellous document .
Nothing else would be acceptable to us .
This applies not only to the scope and frequency of inspections but also to their quality .
The professional competence and background knowledge of inspectors must be improved .
The seat of the authority has frequently been discussed .
I also welcome Commissioner Byrne .
We must be able to trust them .
It is all about balance .
Risk communication will be a key element of the FA .
I welcome the Commission 's balanced proposals on this issue .
It would rule out the candidatures of France , Italy and Barcelona from the outset .
This policy should be maintained .
Food must be of a certain quality , but it should first of all be safe .
Consumers must be able to rely on the inspections being adequate .
Traceability , liability , responsibility , precaution ; they are all essential principles .
Producers must be responsible for the highest quality at every stage of the food chain .
But responsibility should also be clearly defined .
The rapid alert system must remain a political instrument .
Emotions can run high where food is concerned .
Politicians cannot and may not ignore those emotions , but do need to weigh the facts .
But we should not render the European Authority powerless right from the outset .
We do not want a stalemate between the national and European authorities .
Animal welfare should also be brought into the equation , and the quality of our production methods must improve .
The stakes are therefore high .
The consumer has lost a great deal of confidence .
We owe it to the public to provide objective reasons why they should again have confidence .
I hope that this project will be a success .
Inspections cannot turn unsafe food into safe food .
Safe food must be produced .
That is why I am in favour of unequivocal and stringent measures .
The traceability of foodstuffs must be guaranteed throughout the entire production chain .
These must be one of its main political and legislative priorities .
It is crucial that there is rigorous monitoring , from the farm to the consumer ' s table .
Hence the need for a food safety authority which is prestigious and well respected .
The Commission ' s proposals are , admittedly , well formulated .
We must adopt them as a matter of urgency .
Mr Whitehead ' s report is balanced and sensible , which is why I shall be supporting it .
The point is that certain countries vote for EU laws and then quite simply ignore them .
This hypocrisy has to stop .
This is not proposed out of malice . This is not proposed out of mischief .
It is proposed out of principle .
We have a chance today , and in the vote tomorrow , to give a very clear signal .
What signal do we want to give ?
A significant number are editorial and do not change the overall meaning .
There are a large number of amendments , so without further delay I will address them .
A number of amendments refer to food hygiene .
Similarly , Amendments Nos 59 and 72 are too detailed for a horizontal text .
This is not the correct legal instrument and other work is being undertaken in this regard .
Hence we can only partially accept Amendment No 49 .
We have kept food safety requirements apart from other consumer interests .
There are no such factors at this time .
Similar problems are raised by Amendments Nos 55 and 56 on the precautionary principle .
In Amendment No 69 we can only accept the reference to transport .
This brings me to Amendment No 1 .
We cannot accept Amendment No 91 for operational reasons .
Subject to editorial review , we can accept Amendments Nos 160 , 164 and 166 .
We can accept Amendments Nos 103 and 105 on the Board .
Such flexibility is a critical operational requirement of the Authority .
For these reasons , Amendments Nos 21 and 212 are not acceptable .
Amendment No 93 would be acceptable with the deletion of ' for the measures necessary to be taken ' .
The rest of Amendment No 98 is covered by Amendment No 92 .
Amendments Nos 121 , 122 and 123 are not acceptable .
This is a legal impossibility .
That , in my view , provides the degree of clarity and sureness that Parliament requires .
For these reasons , only paragraphs 6a and 6b in Amendment No 154 are acceptable .
Amendments Nos 172 and 173 propose involving Parliament in practical crisis management .
This is not , in my view , compatible with its institutional role of control and supervision .
Neither can we fully accept Amendments Nos 183 and 184 .
Finally , I would like to address the question of the location of the Authority .
Amendments Nos 188 , 190 , 216 , 217 , 218 and 223 are acceptable in part .
Amendment No 215 is not acceptable .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
Some proposed amendments contradict the regulation on TSEs which we have recently adopted .
Category 1 covers risk material .
Category 2 includes animals which have died a natural death .
Implementation in particular will be difficult .
As such , we require strict separation of the material from the three categories .
There is also a need for strict separation of facilities , transport routes , etc .
It is now my hope that Parliament will adopt these principles laid down by a strong majority .
I would ask you to think this through .
We know the catastrophe we caused when we turned ruminants into omnivores .
I appeal for humility in the face of nature ' s own system .
We must not manipulate it a second time .
I would also like you to vote against Amendments Nos 22 and 33 .
These would in fact sabotage part of the categorisation and complicate it .
That would be legal overkill , to put it mildly .
In other words , it would only concern animal diseases .
This would be devastating for public health .
This clearly conflicts with the regulation on TSEs and is probably impossible in practice .
After that introductory comment , may I also hand out a few bouquets .
First of all , let me thank Mrs Paulsen .
And let me also thank Commissioner Byrne .
Both have had a devastating effect on individual farmers and the industry as a whole .
Public confidence has been destroyed .
We still do not know the final death toll of variant CJD .
There is a debate as to how the BSE epidemic started .
That did not work because of cross-contamination .
So in the UK we opted for a complete ban .
She wants to feed chickens to pigs and pigs to chickens .
If the rules were obeyed we would have no problem .
My worry is about cross-contamination .
We should therefore keep to the ban on meat and bone meal .
Amendment No 100 facilitates this continued ban .
The same applies to foot-and-mouth .
It is important that catering waste is included in these proposals .
I should like to make one or two points on the nature of the scourges we face .
We are still learning from the foot-and-mouth epidemic in the United Kingdom .
That is why I too support the idea of looking at alternatives which minimise risk .
Alkaline hydrolysis is one such method .
We need to be able to show that we are ahead of this particular scourge .
We are constantly struggling with the element of unknown risk .
Mr President , Commissioner Byrne , the issue under discussion is the directive on the use of animal by-products .
This will cause these areas unnecessary costs .
I propose that instead of only following principles , we should combine them with common sense .
After all , natural cannibalism does exist as a phenomenon in the animal kingdom .
How will these kinds of animal be treated in the future ?
Directives do not prevent natural cannibalism in animals .
Some 16 million tonnes of animal waste have to be disposed of every year .
In her introduction , Mrs Paulsen very clearly pinpointed all bottlenecks .
This Regulation is of crucial importance .
Then an appeal to enforce a total ban will rightly ensue .
I believe that this regulation offers the sector a fair chance .
The sector will hopefully take that chance .
Both on ethical and scientific grounds , we must abandon cannibalism .
I hope that these pyres will no longer be needed in future .
Anyone who is familiar with the functioning of the food chain will surely see the logic of this principle .
I thank the Commission for its firm proposal dividing animal by-products into three categories .
It would have been far simpler to prohibit them all without further ado .
That approach has been adopted by the German Federal Government , for example .
In our experience , such a requirement presupposes the establishment of an inspection system .
This is also something that inspections will have to prevent .
I cannot understand why anyone would want to impose a permanent ban on this valuable source of protein .
The current rules and checks must be strictly applied .
Once this is guaranteed , it should be possible to use meat and bone meal once again .
For decades these leftovers have been used to produce a highly nutritious pig feed .
Pigs , hens , fish and so on have no scruples about eating their own kind .
The term ' by-products ' as used here refers primarily to meat and bone meal .
Mrs Paulsen has developed very effectively the ideas presented by the Commission .
Omnivores really will eat everything .
We should not try to re-educate them .
As far as ruminants are concerned , it goes without saying that meat and bone meals are taboo .
It also called into question the quality of the meat produced .
At that time , fats and oils were at the centre of the dispute .
This proposal is the second major component in our defence barriers against BSE .
I cannot overemphasise the importance of this proposal .
We are faced with a very stark choice .
These 16 million tonnes do not disappear into thin air .
They have to be disposed of and processed .
This proposal is linked very closely with the issue of BSE .
The reason is obvious .
A significant part of the animal by-products of which we speak is specified risk material .
It is essential that these products in particular are collected , processed and destroyed effectively .
The proposal will achieve this objective .
I have been hugely encouraged by the very constructive approach of Parliament to this proposal .
There has been a very healthy discussion which has focused on improving the text .
And it does so in a manner which can work .
When this regulation enters into force , we will have a system that is state of the art .
I shall also briefly mention the proposal for a directive amending Directives 90 / 425 and 92 / 118 .
I accept the introduction of additional requirements to improve the traceability of products .
However we understand your general concern and will bear it in mind for the future .
We accept the need to introduce additional and stricter requirements to avoid cross-contamination .
We particularly welcome the conditions suggested to prevent abuse of this derogation .
Two different definitions of remote areas are proposed .
We could accept a combination of both .
The request to annex this certificate to the regulation is superfluous and therefore unacceptable .
We cannot accept the proposed inclusion of additional animal by-products in the Category 1 .
Furthermore , it is not practical to test all animals for all known diseases .
It is unrealistic .
We note that many other Parliament amendments would maintain this flexibility .
We can agree to the principle of refrigeration of raw Category 3 material .
In conclusion , the Commission welcomes the report and the many useful and constructive amendments contained therein .
One way or the other , we cannot expect the House to make do with the present system .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
Ozone in ambient air
I can understand that .
Such is the case with air pollution .
Problems remain .
Ground-level ozone is a pollutant which still severely affects the health of many of our citizens .
In severe circumstances people die .
European legislation plays an increasing role in setting tighter standards and curbing pollution .
Nothing better illustrates this than the need for concerted action on ozone .
It is often formed miles from the source of the problem .
So it is a classic trans-boundary pollutant requiring trans-boundary action at European level .
The national emissions ceiling directive will provide the framework for reductions in key air pollutants .
But I argued that the proposals were not demanding enough .
This does not sound too bad a compromise .
I also understand that meteorological conditions vary .
I do not wish , in particular , to place too onerous a burden upon Mediterranean countries .
Concentrations of ozone are very unevenly distributed amongst the Member States .
We have logically opposed the amendments which do not take account of the scientific possibilities of controlling the problem .
I should like to point out the most important features of Mr Davies 's report .
Allow me , finally , also to indicate two other areas included by Mr Davies .
The first is the relationship with the applicant countries .
My group is able to support all the amendments .
We should also like to thank Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo for supporting the compromise amendments .
It refuses to go any further .
We shall adjourn the debate here and resume it at 3 p.m.
Mr von Wogau , we will take good note of your comments .
This is the procedure contained in our Rules of Procedure .
But we will verify whether the information I have been given is up to date .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Before the vote : President .
Mr Pirker has the floor for a point of order .
Pirker ( PPE-DE ) .
Thank you , Mrs Terrón i Cusí .
It is an illness that recurs on a regular basis .

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Whitehead report ( A5-0198 / 2001 )
I was therefore delighted to vote in favour .
That is logical .
Who is going to believe that such a structure will not support the Commission ' s views ?
Yet when all is said and done , perhaps that is what they really want .
The European Food Safety Authority must not be a smokescreen for public opinion .
We therefore voted for Amendment No 100 , which unfortunately was rejected .
I voted in favour of this report .
In principle , I am not in favour of the creation of an agency .
A new Community bureaucracy is being created , and I deplore it .
Under no circumstances can the Food Authority have the task of managing the rapid alert system .
France is one of the great founding countries of the Union .
So far , however , my country has remained one of the worst offenders in this respect .
That is how France will enhance its prestige and its voice will carry greater weight during the forthcoming negotiations .
The European Food Safety Authority was announced in September 1999 .
The White Paper on Food Safety is dated January 2000 .
Of course , the health and well-being of our citizens is of paramount importance .
Labour MEPs have been at the forefront of protecting consumers across Europe .
Paulsen reports ( A5-0185 / 2001 and A5-0200 / 2001 )
I feel hungry .
Come on , let ' s go and eat some delicious hot dogs ! '
I have to say that this had been done even before the directives were passed .
And I ate some excellent hot dogs !
We know the rest .
It is generally held that fodder based on animal meal has encouraged the spread of the livestock disease .
Only those in the third category are to be permitted as ingredients in animal fodder .
The stricter the controls , the better it will be for the health of consumers .
For this reason , I abstained in the vote .
Karamanou report ( A5-0206 / 2001 )
We strongly condemn child pornography .
We consider this to be a very severe and very serious crime .
It is important that legislation defines child pornography as distinctly as possible .
It simply means that the text is inadequate on some points and ambiguous on others .
We strongly condemn child pornography .
We consider this to be a very grave and very serious crime .
It is important that legislation define child pornography as distinctly as possible .
It is not enough , however , to establish legal frameworks .
We must also adopt fundamental political measures , which address the causes .
Therefore one cannot state than any representation of children showing ' sexual behaviour ' is reprehensible .
What concerns us is the ambiguity of a certain number of amendments dealing with virtual products .
This is why we are abstaining from the vote .
I give my unqualified support to that part of the proposals in the Karamanou report .
That part of their objectives will not receive my support .
We have all heard of awful and tragic cases of child pornography and child exploitation across Europe .
We must seek to ensure that history is not repeated .
Our children are our most vulnerable citizens and we should make every effort possible to protect them .
I merely wish to ask whether the written explanations of vote should not be taken first .
Or have these rules been changed again ?
My delegation has remained as we wish to submit a written explanation .
We would like this to be registered and then we would like to be able to leave .
It would therefore be easier if we took the written explanations first .
Is that clear ?
Thank you for your answer .
I was of the opinion that one had to remain also for written explanations of vote .
That is excellent , now I know and will be able to save time in the future .
Klamt report ( A5-0183 / 2001 )
Well , in 2010 I was in a Chinese restaurant and I had a very good meal .
' So you were a Member of the European Parliament ? ' he said .
' You did well to vote for the report against trafficking in human beings !
And he thanked me .
It claims that this is a contribution to the campaign to halt illegal immigration .
In reality , however , this is an alibi .
- ( DA ) We have some reservations regarding the legal bases of both reports .
This brings out the worst in people .
These seek to make money by forcing others into providing involuntary sexual services .
( SV ) We Swedish Christian Democrats welcome the initiative to combat human trafficking .
We have therefore chosen to abstain from voting on these points .
. I support this report against the trafficking in human beings .
Europe needs to crack down on the trade in trafficking human beings .
Not only should this type of activity be punishable , but it should be classed as a criminal offence .
We must not forget the victims ' needs and their suffering in all this .
They should be given better support , including financial compensation from the confiscated proceeds of crime .
Karamanou and Klamt reports ( A5-0256 / 2001 ) and ( A5-0183 / 2001 )
Dybkjær report ( A5-0191 / 2001 )
' No ' I explained . ' I cannot do what you want and vote against this report .
In fact I have voted in favour .
But I have voted for the report and I am very happy to have done so .
The people are demanding democracy , are they ?
Let them make do with the Internet !
Aparicio Sánchez report ( A5-0122 / 2001 )
She said : ' Listen , when will we finally see the Mona Lisa in Italy ?
When will we see Michelangelo ' s Moses in Strasbourg ?
And that is the end of my explanations of vote for today .
In museums , these cultural objects are at least exhibited to the public .
The same is not true , however , of private collections .
That concludes the vote .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.20 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m. )
Ozone in ambient air ( continuation )
Without these changes the legislation will be toothless .
There must be consistency between the EU ' s environmental policy in different areas .
The US President , Mr Bush , has already stated that he wants to renegotiate the Kyoto Accord .
Emissions from the developed world are the primary reason for global warming .
Developed countries must take the first meaningful steps in reducing emissions .
We are all aware that President Bush is due to meet the European Union leaders in Göteborg this week .
I congratulate Mr Davies on his excellent report .
In such conditions , what can we do ?
What can we do to comply with the Kyoto Accord and solve the problem of climatic change ?
The network must cover the whole of Europe , so that everybody can be properly informed .
This report excellently demonstrates why environment policy has to be achieved at a European level .
That is very much the pattern for the rest of Europe .
Ozone is a collective problem which has to be dealt with collectively .
I have one concern , namely that we are trying to set too strict values .
They are going to be , through no fault of their own , in breach of European legislation .
And still they will not solve the problem of ozone .
Still they will find themselves breaching this regulation we are creating .
The proposal sets target values and long-term objectives for ozone in ambient air .
In doing so , the transboundary nature of ozone and cost-efficiency aspects have been taken into account .
Council 's common position adopted in March 2001 takes due account of most of Parliament 's concerns .
Now 32 amendments have been tabled to the text of the common position .
Therefore the Commission cannot accept the second part of Amendment No 23 .
Amendments Nos 3 , 5 and 15 follow the same intention .
Again , this would have to be complemented by taking account of economic efficiency as well .
Therefore , those amendments could only be accepted in principle .
Several amendments would enforce the obligations of Member States to report to the public and the Commission .
The Commission welcomes these amendments if the requirements are considered feasible and useful .
The Commission therefore could accept Amendments Nos 8 , the second part of 10 and 16 .
Amendment No 11 would be acceptable in part . Amendment No 17 , in principle .
Amendment 32 would complement Amendment No 17 in a way that is acceptable .
The first part of Amendment No 10 and Amendments Nos 18 to 20 and 25 are not acceptable .
There are four amendments on other issues .
As Amendment No 33 incorporates those aspects , it could be accepted in principle .
However , no direct comparison of Member States should be required .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Wallström .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
WTO Panel / Section 211
We believe this is especially necessary in the realm of trade policy .
We in the committee did not pronounce ourselves on this dispute .
Let me add that the Commission , especially Commissioner Lamy , has kept us regularly briefed .
Accordingly , none of our criticism in this case has been directed at the Commission .
It is about the extraterritorial application of domestic legislation .
Why is this so important ?
These desires have been examined and assessed very carefully .
Besides the obligations laid down in the Treaty , the Council requires openness .
This situation cannot be tolerated indefinitely , and we demand changes .
I therefore believe that there is ultimately no alternative to a judicious change of procedure .
In calling for change , we are merely exercising our parliamentary power of scrutiny .
Under the Portuguese Presidency , for instance , we were invited to take part in these talks .
I believe the Swedish Presidency still has a pledge to honour in this respect .
We could then begin a dialogue and bring it to a satisfactory conclusion .
Mr President , may I pick up on a point that Konrad Schwaiger has just made .
What you have seen this time will be seen more often in the future .
These numerous trade disputes with the United States are a prime example .
I believe that the institutions have always found ways and means of cooperating in the past .
I wish the Council would do likewise and find a new procedure .
We largely agree on the substance of this issue .
I broadly agree .
I find it very striking that both the Commission and the Council have failed to do that this time .
It has been suggested that those who have signed this hotly worded declaration were behaving irresponsibly .
Some Members of this Parliament feel it was irresponsible .
It is not an issue of reforming Article 133 .
Mr President , others have talked about the issue of dispute settlement specifically .
This specific case demonstrates precisely the absence of democratic accountability in EU trade policy .
Meanwhile at Council level the 133 Committee meets behind closed doors .
As parliamentarians we are not even allowed as observers much less as participants .
We receive no minutes of these meetings .
There is no formal dialogue between us .
I believe we have to accept that certain decisions of the past require revision .
The European Parliament is responsible for monitoring the common trade policy .
We have co-decision rights on matters relating to the single market .
In other words , we must stand shoulder to shoulder as equal partners and strive for success .
In the discussion here in the Chamber , I have identified two distinct trends .
The first trend , represented by Mr Schwaiger among others , would require us to change the procedure .
I assume that Mr Schwaiger considers that we must change the rules .
Of course , some might think that this should possibly have been changed .
We have an Intergovernmental Conference coming up in 2004 .
Mr Schwaiger hopes to see changes as early as in Laeken .
Let us return to the discussion then .
So what opportunities do we have if we cannot achieve progress along formal lines ?
The Council has demonstrated that we want dialogue .
I can only regret this .
We therefore observed the procedures entirely correctly .
I myself have responded to oral and written questions which have been raised by the Members of this House .
I have also met some Members in person in order to discuss the subject with them .
That is the first point .
Thank you for the initiative of your diplomats .
The U.S. Congress , however , has not yet approved the ' fast track ' proposal .
This means that the U.S. Congress currently has direct participatory powers in Qatar .
We in the European Parliament are no longer receiving sufficient information from you .
You no longer have any national control ; you no longer have any European control ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
When I arrived , the door was already closed .
I know nothing about any other meeting .
Mr President , in my initial speech I mentioned the two informal meetings concerned .
The first took place on 29 May and the second on 31 May .
I am sorry that one of the dates was unsuitable .
I have attempted to describe some of the measures taken by the Swedish Presidency .
I am convinced that the coming presidency will work in the same spirit .
Thank you very much , Mr Danielsson .
The debate is closed .
Clever executives always get parliaments involved when foreign policy or trade are at issue .
With your permission , I will illustrate this by way of a few examples .
In this respect I fully share the views of our committee chairman .
Allow me to make one additional comment .
We are in the business of helping each other .
There will soon be eighteen or twenty countries on the European side .
In conclusion , I should once again like to refer to Mr Brok 's opening comments .
Relations between states are of course negotiated formally by their governments .
That is why the committee 's idea ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
We have not reached that stage yet .
Fortunately , these are high on the agenda in the ASEM process .
We welcome the fact that the European Union is committed .
Asia is large , and Asians will mainly need to solve their problems themselves .
The emphasis in this connection is on democracy and human rights .
However , we should not neglect the safety aspects .
Preventing the proliferation or spread of nuclear weapons also springs to mind , for example .
Asia cannot be compared to the European Union .
It is unclear which country will in time be at the helm in that region .
There are major paradoxes .
China is developing fast , but is not a democracy .
India is large , but vulnerable , and the Japanese engine is misfiring .
Direct criticism pertaining to special situations should not get lost in multilateral declarations .
The region is not served by organised silence .
Their presence did not reveal any sense of involvement .
It is , of course , understandable .
But that is another matter .
This is an important point , in our view .
The United States has been issuing visas in this connection for much longer .
We will no doubt be backing some amendments by the GUE Group .
We did find Mr Dupuis ' original report exciting .
We need no longer place the main focus of policy on China .
Finally , the ASEM process is of major importance to us .
We would also like to see MEPs become more involved .
We are looking forward to the talks on ASEM IV .
We hope and trust that the European Commission will be closely involving us in that process .
Mr President , this report has a somewhat turbulent history .
The fact is , however , that it is in the process of being changed quite radically .
The second problem is about visas for Taiwan ' s top leaders .
I have to admit that I think this is quite difficult .
This is clearly problematic .
For my part I will abstain from the vote on this point .
Mr President , the ASEM process has a twin role , politically speaking .
I should like to add two minor observations regarding this resolution .
From this angle , the European Parliament makes anything but a constructive contribution to the ASEM process .
The ever more strife-torn Indonesian archipelago is a case in point .
Three countries are mentioned in this connection : India , Australia and New Zealand .
However , honourable European intentions collide here with Asian realities , or rather national sensitivities .
However , our own actions rarely live up to our promises .
To conclude these brief remarks , I commend the Brok report to the House .
We know how much effort Parliament has put into producing this report .
I should like to point out a number of facts .
These conflicts have complicated root causes .
That is not the point .
I am thinking here both of food safety and the fight against organised crime .
This opens up huge possibilities .
Under no circumstances must we Europeans let this opportunity pass us by !
We also think that ASEM should be concentrating upon issues of global concern .
The Commission does not share this view and nor do other European partners .
We addressed a multitude of issues .
At the same time , the need to improve the management of the ASEM process is extremely clear .
That is why we have proposed to cluster activities .
There seems to be a high degree of consensus on the need for reform .
There should be more scope for free discussion and bilateral meetings .
We have also discussed the importance of involving parliamentarians in the process .
Young parliamentarians have met under the auspices of ASEF , the Asia-Europe foundation .
I was delighted by the calls for greater involvement of Parliament in the ASEM process .
This is the third time that I have had the opportunity to discuss ASEM in Parliament .
We shared a sort of post-candlelight supper together .
I expect to return to Parliament shortly to discuss a new communication intended to update the 1994 Asia strategy .
My own recent visit to China demonstrated the importance of the European Union there too .
I could have talked about Japan . I could have talked about South-East Asia .
There are a number of subjects which we need to discuss in more detail .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Development of the external service
It is a welcome communication nevertheless , since it allows us to open a debate on that important issue .
I therefore take a positive view of this communication from the Commission .
When I say ' we ' , I mean , of course , the Committee on Budgets .
The Committee on Budgets simply wishes to draw the attention of all those involved to two basic problems .
Firstly , there is the need to move quickly .
We believe that the reform should be carried out rapidly and ambitiously .
This resistance must be broken down .
Thirdly , there is the problem of horizontal redeployment .
Both types of staff are necessary and the balance between the two needs to be rationally organised .
The second point that I should like to mention quickly is the budgetary aspect .
Mr President , first of all , I want to thank the rapporteur .
In the future , the work is therefore to be done out in the field .
I am thinking especially of Slovakia and the Czech Republic in this context .
Even the European Court of Auditors criticises this .
That regional offices are more economical than several individual offices is obvious .
That they are also more effective has not , however , been verified .
Here too the conceptual weakness of the Commission communication manifests itself .
From the point of view of content the Commission is still in debt .
I believe - in fact we agree on this - that we need to leave history behind .
We need to consider the current functions of the delegation , based on the functions of the Union .
This brings me back , Commissioner , to the debate of a few minutes ago .
I believe that it is precisely in Asia that we need more delegations .
Mr Galeote 's report proposes Singapore and Taipei as the places where we should open delegations immediately .
That is why it is high time that we also open an office in Taiwan .
If there is no money then say : we need the money .
The package as a whole , however , lacks coherence and a great deal remains to be done .
In my view , that combination is just a touch difficult to detect at the present moment .
The necessary coordination does not exist within the European Union .
It is therefore essential for the Union to put its all its weight behind the external services and coordination .
That is why it is important to take the direction indicated by Mr Galeote .
In addition to consultation , we must also increase the number of local agents in the delegations .
Mr President , I welcome the Galeote report .
In that context I would like to make some very brief points .
We have pussyfooted on that issue for far too long .
I can assure Parliament that the recommendations made in the report are extremely important for the Commission .
We will , of course , continue to report regularly to Parliament on the progress we make .
Let me offer a number of observations .
First , this Parliament stresses its wish to clarify its relations with the external delegations .
This is something that we have debated in the Council .
We are now in the middle of the first wave of the deconcentration exercise .
Deconcentration concepts have been established for each major programme .
Staff requirements have been assessed for each delegation .
Officials are in the process of being selected and trained .
There is one point that I want to emphasise very strongly .
There is nothing whatsoever to be said for deconcentration while retaining a collection of mothers-in-law in Brussels .
If one is going to deconcentrate , then that means management of programmes on the ground .
The second session is starting this autumn .
Finally , let me comment on the proposed action plan .
I hope the message is clear .
We take the reform and development of the external service very seriously .
But it is a long haul .
It requires careful planning , training and not least funding .
I just want to make one very obvious point to Parliament , which may be a little prosaic .
Ambition depends on two things .
First of all , ambition depends on having the money to actually implement your ambitions .
Secondly , ambition depends on being prepared to take tough political decisions in order to achieve your ambitions .
In the past Parliament has insisted that there should be a ceiling on the number of delegations .
We have to be absolutely open about any tough decisions we have to make .
Then all of us together have to share in taking the political responsibility for those decisions .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken on Thursday at noon .
Proposal for a Council regulation on GSP for 2002 - 2004
However , we must not forget that some tariff barriers are still important , even now .
I shall quote a few examples .
We have got rid of some categories .
There were four categories before , whereas now there are only two .
The former is certain and stable , while the latter remains uncertain .
This monitoring is not , therefore , an abusive or offensive intrusion into the internal affairs of these countries .
In Europe we have 18 million employers in a labour force of 250 million .
I shall reply briefly to Mr Rübig on two topics .
The first of these concerns the nature of the existing obstacles to imports .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Lamy for his presentation .
I have a few questions .
I was very glad to hear what you said about tariff escalation .
A doubling sounds very good , but we are starting from an extremely low base .
I also have a question about the longer term .
The enhanced GSP system obviously works as a system of incentives .
I shall reply to the various points raised by Mrs Lucas .
There will still be a zero rate for certain products .
Tariff escalation comes into play , but its impact is reduced by the preference margin that we are offering .
This proposal includes temporary withdrawal in the case of slavery or forced labour .
This was already included in the previous proposal .
Mr President , thank you for your comments , Commissioner Lamy .
Has the Commission already considered this ?
Can you say anything more about this ?
I shall reply to the three questions from Mr Kreissl-Dörfler .
The others are being examined .
Why is it not a longer list ?
This is not a unanimous position , nor is it equally firm in every country .
The spectrum is relatively broad , but it still poses problems sometimes .
These negotiations have been going on for almost five years and will probably last another five .
We are making quite good progress here .
Thank you Commissioner .
That concludes this item .
Question Time ( Council )
Question No 1 by ( H-0437 / 01 ) :
If not , why not ?
I will be very brief .
Ladies and gentlemen , the response illustrates that there is an urgent need for democratic control of Europol .
A Europol employee is being arrested as we speak , and other arrests may be imminent .
The problems which Mr Staes brought up are certainly real .
We all know that it is a very necessary organisation .
You identified a new structure for Europol in the future .
Are there any plans to bring Europol under democratic control ?
Question No 2 by ( H-0439 / 01 ) :
What progress has been made with realising those short-term aims ?
Has Turkey made a start in moving towards them ?
As we know , the Council adopted the Accession Partnership on 8 March 2001 .
The European Union makes greater demands than that .
After the visit , the General Affairs Council also adopted conclusions .
That is hardly surprising .
I do have some understanding for the time aspect .
This approach seems to be at odds with the sound measures taken on behalf of minorities .
I hope that the Troika can be firm but fair in its conclusions .
This development , which the Council is monitoring carefully , is deeply disturbing .
The trial of the Fazilet Party is also under way .
We should all monitor this vital issue carefully in the future .
Question No 3 by ( H-0444 / 01 ) :
Can the Council state what action it intends to take , and in what quarters , to ensure that :
Croatia is , as we all know , one of these countries .
One such issue is the adoption of a new law to protect minorities .
The Council is already monitoring these issues .
The report adopted by the Council yesterday allows for a certain amount of optimism .
Question No 4 by ( H-0446 / 01 ) :
Have limits been placed on the number and length of the nets which can be used at each tide ?
Question No 5 by ( H-0453 / 01 ) :
I have a follow-up question for the honourable Council representative .
Ireland has said no to the Treaty of Nice .
The honourable Member is bringing up a separate issue .
I do not believe I referred to the Treaty of Nice in the way which Mr Sjöstedt suggests .
I note the statements from the Irish government regarding the continuing process in Ireland .
Therefore , I believe there is reason to return to this .
Question No 6 by ( H-0456 / 01 ) :
It has been reported that Mr Bush will be accompanied by a large number of security staff .
Police action during the European Council in Gothenburg does not fall within the competence of the Council .
That is what I call a short answer .
This is remarkable .
I wonder who does have responsibility .
The European Council in itself is a Council issue .
Question No 7 by ( H-0483 / 01 ) :
Those arrested had to identify themselves to the police .
The police also systematically made video recordings of peaceful demonstrators .
This check must be carried out in accordance with Swedish law .
A check revealed the answer to both these questions to be an unequivocal no .
I thank the honourable Council representative for that unusually clear reply .
I am happy with this answer , as I think it is important .
Is this in line with the usual freedom of speech and right to demonstrate ?
As President-in-Office , I definitely have no authority to answer the question .
As it has proven possible to swap hats , I also have a question .
They appear to have been in position in Sweden for a number of weeks .
Can we have any information on this matter ?
It is not in the interests of the Swedish Government to contribute to speculation .
Question No 9 by ( H-0462 / 01 ) :
Company restructuring was understandable in the context of undertakings facing real economic problems .
What are you going to do ?
I would like you to provide clarification on this point .
I must ask to return to your detailed questions at a later date .
The discussion in the Council went on until the very last moment yesterday .
I would therefore request that I may get back to you with more precise answers to you detailed questions .
It is a great result for the Swedish Presidency .
I believe that the compromise reached yesterday was quite difficult to achieve .
For the time being , let us be happy about the progress represented by yesterday ' s decision .
As the author is not present , Question No 10 lapses .
As they deal with the same subject , Questions Nos 11 and 12 shall be taken together .
Question No 11 by ( H-0469 / 01 ) :
I can only briefly repeat what was said then .
So far no desire has been expressed on this from other parties .
Nor has the Commission put forward any proposal or other initiative on this matter for the Council to address .
Thank you for your answer .
I was expecting you to give the same answer as the one you gave in writing .
This is often the argument used against it .
Do you not think , therefore , that the Commission could at least carry out a feasibility study ?
I believe that the reasons given by Mrs Boudjenah are very well-founded .
I believe that the feasibility studies requested have already been carried out by a number of independent institutions .
Therefore , I am convinced that it will be possible to continue discussing this issue in an objective way .
Mr President , I am as disappointed as my colleagues at the response .
It was always possible for the Swedish Presidency itself to put the item on the agenda .
I think I have probably already answered this question , but I am happy to repeat my reply .
Therefore , there does not seem to be any need for further studies .
Mr President , has the Council considered other means of achieving the same goals ?
We are probably in agreement on these goals .
The European Union and the Council played a leading role in this .
I suggest that you look at the discussions which took place during this conference .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I am also extremely disappointed by this answer .
What is it going to cost and how is sustainable development going to be funded in developing countries ?
Question No 15 by ( H-0479 / 01 ) :
I thank the Council for its reply .
The Council does not accept the type of phenomenon which you mention .
Question No 16 by ( H-0481 / 01 ) :
In addition , the Taliban continue to reject the mediation efforts of the UN and others .
Thank you very much for your reply .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , what could be done ?
The EU ' s approach must be to contribute to international coordination .
Therefore , I believe that we must focus our initiatives on this particular approach .
Question No 17 by ( H-0482 / 01 ) :
I would just like to clarify what Mr Sacrédeus no doubt already knows .
This decision only applied to bilateral exchanges - EU cooperation was not affected .
The Presidency has not yet received any such request .
The Council has not discussed the hypothetical question brought up by the honourable Member at all .
Therefore , I cannot answer the question on behalf of the Council .
Parliament also gave its opinion on all these regulations on 3 May 2001 .
The European Parliament will be urged to give its opinion on both these drafts .
The Council believes that all possible measures have been taken .
I have counted the numerous different decisions taken by the Council .
Question No 21 by ( H-0490 / 01 ) :
An action plan for the EU / Central Asia will be approved in the next few weeks .
In addition , Europol has opened negotiations with 23 countries on entering into cooperation agreements .
As with all of these questions , the real substance is hidden elsewhere within the question .
I would like a response on that .
It is difficult to give a clear answer to the more precise question from Mr Crowley .
I have also tried to describe the ways in which this is happening .
I am not in a position to make any clear statement on cause and effect .
Belgium will be taking over the presidency after Sweden .
This is a policy which Belgium is now about to adopt .
Among the 15 Member States we have various legal traditions in this area .
I can , with a certain amount of resignation , state that there is much still to be done .
I am sure that our Belgian friends will be perfectly able to take the discussion forwards .
I have a feeling that a number of presidencies after Belgium will also have to deal with the issue .
We offer him our most sincere best wishes , both on a personal level and for the Gothenburg summit .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.35 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
Protection of Community forests
In Europe , 60 million hectares are stated to be at risk of fire .
In this respect we have the problem of the Kyoto Summit .
In addition , both measures expire at the end of this year .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Simplifying conditions for invoicing in respect of VAT
The other aspect concerns electronic signatures .
Parliament and the Council have adopted a directive to ensure that use is made of this simplified electronic signature .
We now have the opportunity to use this directive and to provide guarantees for tax administrations .
I think that this principle , proposed by the Commission , should be maintained .
Madam President , I have little to add to what Mrs Torres Marques has said .
I would highlight that the Commission ' s proposal seems to me to be a good one .
My good friend Mrs Torres Marques has stressed this effectively .
I believe that it fulfils four of the fundamental objectives relating to simplifying administrative obligations .
This innovation is therefore welcome .
The Commission proposed that the invoice should have a single number .
My Group will support it .
I will end by saying that Mrs Torres Marques ' s report is a good one .
The preliminary report was also a good one .
The amendments seek above all to reduce companies ' administrative costs and thus strengthen competition .
For this reason we can support these amendments which contribute to a genuine simplification of our tax legislation .
The Commission ' s proposal and Mrs Torres Marques ' excellent report promote this trend .
At the moment this figure is 10 % .
So the significance is far from small .
Using advanced electronic signatures must not be compulsory .
Two problems have been pinpointed .
Various speakers have already drawn attention to that tonight .
The compulsory set of requirements is indeed different in each Member State .
In most cases it is very restrictive .
Electronic invoicing is sometimes not possible at all .
It is therefore extremely difficult to use it in cross-border trade .
I personally am confident that such an agreement will be reached rapidly .
The Commission 's ambition remains that of a single point-of-origin VAT system .
One can buy the cheapest ones for EUR 20 or EUR 30 .
The savings in administrative costs more than outweigh initial outlay .
In conclusion , Parliament 's support for this proposal is important in order to achieve a good result .
I thank Parliament and the rapporteur very much indeed .
Thank you , Commissioner .
I shall therefore give the floor to Mrs Laguiller .
Thank you for allowing me to speak .
What is worse is that VAT is not calculated according to the income of the tax payer .
A billionaire will pay tax at exactly the same rate as an employee earning the lowest income .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Termination of service of Commission officials
We have , however , to live in the real world and therefore we must take those decisions .
It will also allow the other institutions to go ahead with implementing their own scheme .
This is the only way I can really describe it .
Madam President , I would like to thank Bill Miller for a very comprehensive and thorough piece of work .
We hope to carry them out thoroughly and quickly , as Commissioner Kinnock forwards them to us .
It does need to be seen in that context .
The worst thing we could possibly do is make an offer which nobody takes up .
That would frustrate what the Commission is trying to do .
They will not be on the EPP voting list .
We have a consensus on that .
Clearly it is not reasonable that they should effectively be rewarded twice at the European taxpayers ' expense .
I hope the Commission will accept those sensible provisions that Bill Miller has put into the report .
That is a recognition of our dual role .
It is quite clear that we have to address exactly the same issues .
But this package is disconnected from that , and quite rightly so .
This is said by way of welcoming the continued reform work .
Nevertheless you will of course allow me first of all to repudiate this description here .
To conclude , my verdict is positive .
However , I do not support the Ferber amendments .
Reform is an exceptional event and should be regarded as such .
Thirdly , this early retirement proposal has a neutral budgetary impact .
The 342 remaining posts will be given back to the budgetary authority .
It will also ensure that the ceiling of Heading 5 of the financial perspective is fully respected .
I will come to the amendments by Mr Ferber later on .
We therefore welcome them very warmly .
There are three reasons for that .
I am sure that that requirement is well understood and supported across this House .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Universal service in electronic communications
This is a complex text and the procedure for review has also been complex .
We did not vote on any of them , they were accepted by us in our report .
I should like to say a few things about the text itself .
It is a very comprehensive text because it contains four distinct measures .
They anticipate technical development .
They will be good for consumers because they sustain and develop competition .
Some of the amendments contained in our opinion have been incorporated into the text , as he has said .
I hope that the rapporteur and his group will be generous enough to accept these amendments .
Madam President , we agree with the rapporteur 's description of the problem and thank him for that .
However , I think that we should not be too optimistic when it comes to competition .
We all know the ways of the market .
Without discriminating between customers depending on how they want to pay their subscription .
We have seen it happen .
We already have competition .
We need general principles which specifically protect consumers because that is the way to make better progress here .
The amendments voted in committee are a step in this direction .
Other amendments could have gone further still , if a majority in the committee had wanted this to happen .
Universal service is a much wider concept which has many other more complex goals .
It of course requires planned funding .
Lastly , I would reiterate that it is independent of the legal nature of the company that provides it .
It should , therefore , be desired , defined , affirmed and chosen on its own merits .
Allow me to make five observations .
First of all , it is essential to have a level playing field .
That would seem wrong to me .
A third fundamental point is caller location information where 112 , our European emergency number , is concerned .
That is important , but I should urge you to mainly use this location information for relevant cases .
Set top boxes must be compatible with each other .
A common interface is required for that purpose .
This is legislated for excellently in Annex 6 .
We must pledge our support for this .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
We fully accept a process which contains of good number of progressive perspectives .
But , while public monopolies are unsatisfactory , private ones are totally unacceptable and unbearable .
These considerations are reflected in this report .
This is particularly true with regard to the TV standards which appear in some of the amendments .
We have also fought a great deal over the term " co-regulation " .
Balance in this report is important .
The first is the scope of the universal service obligations .
In addition , in some places there is still insufficient demand for these kinds of connections .
For the reasons which I have stated I feel that this amendment goes too far .
I welcome the inclusion in the directive of a future European regional code ' 3883 ' .
I believe that this is an information measure which will also promote our internal market .
I also welcome the provisions on number portability in the mobile sector .
This too has already been mentioned by Mr van Velzen .
Amendments Nos 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 and 15 are genuine improvements .
This would introduce competition between operators as well as create pan-European services and markets .
His suggestion for remuneration of network operators is a welcome balance of the interests at stake .
Amendments Nos 45 and 46 are welcome in principle .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Structural business statistics
Since 1998 , these statistics have also included the area of insurance services .
I do all this to make sure that we are not badly-informed political decision makers .
As you know , political decision-makers who are badly informed make bad judgments and take bad decisions .
I would also like to add that the data compiled by Eurostat are also used for sustainable development indicators .
For other sectors , it has been planned to introduce these activities on a very flexible basis .
Madam President , I would firstly like to thank Mrs Lulling for her work .
In summary , she has improved on the Commission ' s text .
Mrs Lulling has also referred to environmental issues .
She rightly says that it is true that the additional statistics may mean limited excess costs .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Silicone breast implants
The first option was for a status quo and no ban .
The second option was an outright ban on silicone breast implants .
I thank Commissioner Liikanen for the initiatives that he has put forward .
A scientific study was inaugurated under STOA , Parliament 's assessment panel .
Nobody would listen to her . They treated her somewhat as an eccentric .
I congratulate Parliament and the Petitions Committee .
That campaign has continued for years and they are still fighting .
Many of them believe that there should be a complete ban .
I cannot stress that too strongly .
We talk about the information to prospective clients undergoing this operation .
That information has to be available from independent sources .
It is not good enough for that information to come from the surgeon carrying out the operation .
We also talk about registration .
It has finally been recognised that there is a problem .
My group supports these proposals .
I would also like to give a warning about systems of patient registers .
This is something which each Member State must consider very , very carefully .
By setting an age limit , I believe we are making it even more attractive .
It is a matter which we must take measures against in some other way .
I believe the reports on the entire issue have shown us this .
Finally , there should be comprehensive national lists of registered private clinics and trained plastic surgeons .
It gave a chance to the citizens to come with their serious problems and concerns .
It is now subject to internal Commission consultation procedures .
The Commission 's communication will be sent to Parliament as soon as it is adopted .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
( The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m. )
Certainly , Mrs Redondo Jiménez .
Preparation for European Council ( Göteborg 15 / 16 June 2001 )
I call Mrs Lindh , President-in-Office of the Council .
The environmental chapter has been completed with no fewer than four applicant countries .
We can therefore talk about real breakthroughs in the negotiations .
As such , we can confirm the principle of differentiation .
Each applicant country is assessed on its own merits and controls the pace of the negotiations .
We held ministerial meetings with all the applicant countries on Monday and Tuesday .
They were all very pleased with the progress achieved during the negotiations .
I believe that we must draw three conclusions following Nice .
Thirdly , we must all become better at making our citizens feel more connected with the EU .
We discussed the issues for the future here in Parliament most recently on 30 May .
However , the exact make-up must be dealt with in Laeken .
We have also developed work on preventing armed conflict .
In this work , the UN is our most important partner .
The Balkans , the Middle East and Africa are particular priorities .
However , as we all know , the situation remains critical .
In Southern Serbia , developments are more positive .
( Applause )
I would like to make a few brief remarks on the subject .
However , the enlargement process must not be held up .
As I will say again in a few minute 's time , it is a historical and political necessity .
The Commission will therefore continue to do its full duty to achieve this goal .
Nevertheless , there is a political lesson to be learned .
Every referendum tells a story .
That is not the point .
We need to take on board the lesson the citizens are teaching us .
It is imperative that we stop this way of working .
( Applause )
The Commission is ready to make an active contribution to this structure .
Let me now return to my two original topics : sustainable development and enlargement .
I would like to outline what I hope the Summit will achieve in these two areas .
Firstly , sustainable development .
Far from being contradictory , economic , social and environmental objectives are actually complementary .
Let me give you just a few examples of what we want to achieve at Gothenburg .
Even the other continents look to us , although this may not always be apparent .
Moving on to my second subject : enlargement .
It must happen now for the time is ripe .
We must therefore make every effort to complete the process swiftly .
Its impartial , institutional role ensures that the process is not thrown off course by short-term political considerations .
The road map is therefore appropriate and must be continued .
I have listed them in ascending order of the difficulties they pose .
The Commission is therefore ready to propose the necessary technical solutions and the necessary political compromises .
Ladies and gentlemen , the need for public support is clear .
Enlargement will increase the Union 's population by 30 % .
Together , we can do more and do it better .
The enlarged Union will be a stronger and more influential actor on the world 's stage .
But this is not all .
We intend , at the same time , to pursue a similar strategy towards Ukraine .
( Applause )
And we must say as much , loud and clear , to the people of central Europe .
We must send out this message .
We must also be flexible .
We are currently debating the Structural Funds .
Some people want to keep everything they had in the past .
Others want to do away with the Structural Funds altogether .
Solidarity should not just be a slogan ; it should be manifested in the form of specific deeds .
A minority of 300 000 people live there .
( Applause )
I suggest that we make an effort to guarantee the flexibility needed here .
Now to Ireland . I think we should guard against meting out swift advice to Ireland .
It is up to the Irish government now to show the way forward .
Then we shall see what needs to be done .
( Applause )
We have come a long way together .
But please fight for it , especially if you fail to muster complete support .
Of course , the decisions will be taken under the Belgian presidency .
( Applause )
The American president , George Bush , will be in Gothenburg .
Our group values partnership and friendship with America .
We greet the American president and welcome him to Europe .
We urge you to represent this position clearly .
( Noise , heckling )
( Applause ) Were it any other way , you would hear our voice .
But , with your leave , Madam President , one last word .
That is why he is right on this count .
( Applause )
Please help to bring it about .
( Applause )
Sweden has proved herself and her Presidency has been successful in many areas .
I would like to stress that you have acted transparently , graciously and amicably towards Parliament .
The French National Assembly yesterday ratified the Treaty of Nice .
However , in the case of Ireland , I believe that two issues arise which we must examine .
Secondly , I will refer to the conclusions which you have presented to the Council .
That is how things are done .
In that way we will be able to engage all of our people .
Madam President , I would like to make a final comment about the visit of President Bush .
I would encourage the minister to continue working towards a reassuring timetable in Göteborg .
It has become more necessary now to reassure , act and deliver on the enlargement agenda .
With regard to the Irish result , I should like to make one or two detailed comments .
The number of " no " voters in Ireland has not grown .
That is a serious issue .
After that there will eventually be a second referendum .
It is important that we have this period of deep reflection .
Madam President , to my group Gothenburg is above all a summit on sustainable development .
We have waited for this for a long time and we do not want to lose this opportunity .
In this context I must make a personal confession .
The Kyoto Protocol is absolutely the key issue in Gothenburg .
My group says a definitive no to this trend .
We want to focus on the alternatives .
These can no longer be addressed behind closed doors .
This means that candidate countries too must be able to be fully included in this process .
The first concerns the official reactions to this bombshell , which took all the leading European figures by surprise .
That is what I would call burying one ' s head in the sand .
We are facing a problem that looms far larger than Nice and Ireland .
So this backlash is hardly surprising .
The same applies in other areas , especially the economic and social area .
First , in my view , we must respect the rules of democracy .
Ireland 's future relationship with the European Union is a critically important matter .
There are lessons for us all to learn from the results of the Nice Treaty referendum .
This is very important if we are to ensure a halt to the depletion of the ozone layer .
How can the foreign ministers simply let the ratifications continue ?
The Treaty of Nice has come to nothing .
It was not , of course , a specifically Irish ' no ' .
Why should the electorate vote in favour of less influence ?
Nor has the European Parliament been fulsome in its praise for Nice .
The initial judgement of the voters is : Try again !
There is nothing else about enlargement in the Treaty .
I would also , Madam President , like to talk about transparency .
You have attached great importance to transparency , and so I have two questions .
The Irish referendum has shown that the system is absurd .
The Swedish Presidency could give the signal for this to happen .
Lastly , Madam President , I would just like to say a few brief words about the agencies .
The people are turning away from a Europe in which they cannot recognise themselves .
To speed up federalism under these conditions would be the quick road to ruin .
The Gothenburg Council may still have a chance of getting things back on an even keel .
What should it decide ?
It should then announce that the supplementary provisions on enlargement will be incorporated in the accession treaties .
That is what we propose in our counter-report on the Treaty of Nice .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am concerned about the result in Ireland .
It is a victory for those who wish to stop and say no .
This is the clear message which I believe is needed .
But we should also examine ourselves .
Citizens , not only in Ireland , are questioning what the EU is doing .
Many people wish to foist tasks on the EU which can better be dealt with domestically .
There is another summit being held .
The leadership must focus on what unites us .
Working with the US to ensure peace and increased free trade must be the primary task .
I hope that both summits achieve concrete results and wish everyone the best of luck .
I would like to give the Swedish government full marks for its work .
This is the way it should be , but there is also a social dimension .
All this is required for sustainable development .
The ecological aspects must also have an impact on us globally .
But we must also act globally .
This is an historic opportunity which we must not let slip through our fingers .
Sweden has achieved a great deal of success during its Presidency .
Now the focus must be on further progress and building on this legacy .
I believe that it was good to be so clear on the issue of a convention .
War is better in a media society .
However , I would like to thank Mrs Lindh for her excellent work so far .
President Bush is coming to Gothenburg .
Should we not first , or perhaps at the same time , do something about this ?
It is easier to negotiate once one has " put ones own house in order " .
The other major environmental problem in Europe is traffic .
We are putting a little over EUR 40 billion into this area .
Remember that this summit was launched as the first ' green ' summit .
The Commission ' s proposal is an important first step , I would say a minimum step .
The summit must stake out such a path .
There must be a good result .
It is not just about us but about future generations .
I wish the summit well and hope for a successful , ' green ' outcome .
The European Council in Gothenburg must make it clear that Ireland ' s rejection will be respected .
This means that the Treaty of Nice has failed .
It is a case of the EU having to follow its own rules .
Without it , the national democracies lose control of the Union .
This is why it is unbelievable that the Swedish government can say that the Treaty of Nice still stands .
By doing so , it is ignoring the democratic rules .
I think that is a question which the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs should answer .
The people of Ireland voted no to the Treaty of Nice .
As such , it was also a vote for a better and more democratic Europe .
Ireland ' s no was not , however , a no to EU enlargement .
Enlarging the EU will work perfectly well based on the Treaty of Amsterdam .
It would be a serious matter if this were to happen .
I hope that the Swedish government will fight for and succeed in retaining the concrete content of the strategy .
Mr President , on 28 September last year the Danes plainly said ' no ' to the euro .
Last Thursday , the Irish unequivocally rejected the Treaty of Nice .
This is not democratic fiddle-faddle .
But what they voted on was the Nice Treaty .
The involvement of the national parliaments as the representatives of European democracy is a key point here .
Mr President , may I at the outset offer Sweden my congratulations on its effective presidency .
I will be forgiven for concentrating on the Irish situation .
The Irish people have spoken .
The answer is " no " .
We must respect that decision .
If that were the case , they would not need ratification from all 15 Member States .
If it is not the case , they must not treat the decision as an irrelevancy .
Please be careful .
There was an assumption that the outcome was a fait accompli .
The list is endless - take your pick .
They are all issues worthy of debate , but nothing to do with the Nice Treaty .
The jury is out .
Those two things are not incompatible .
I do therefore ask you to make sure it does not become a watered down version .
Mr President , the talk is of a Danish solution for Ireland .
It will be cutting itself off from influence but nonetheless complying with the decisions taken .
It is muzzling itself and shooting itself in the foot .
Mr Bonde has voted against every scrap of European cooperation .
Do not listen to him !
Mr President , the Treaty of Nice is dead and must not be given the kiss of life .
The rejection of the Treaty of Nice by the Irish people is not a rejection of enlargement .
No one campaigned against enlargement on the " no " side .
The Nice result is not an outburst of Euro-scepticism .
It is an indication of a serious rethink about Europe across the continent .
I did not know how that decision was made .
None of our citizens knew how that decision was made .
We voted " no " because of those kinds of problems .
( The President cut the speaker off )
So why do the people of Ireland seem to think otherwise ?
That comes home to roost at critical moments .
And Friday was certainly not the first time .
It is disquieting .
It would be wrong to let the Irish carry the can .
We need more than just greater transparency if we are to overcome this European crisis .
It is nothing less than the political significance of the European Union that is at stake .
Our Heads of Government need to talk seriously to their opposite numbers about this .
The Gothenburg Summit has to be the starting point .
Some people pretend to believe that this was just a passing whim .
It will not surprise you that I welcome this .
The Irish lesson is a good one .
They have said " no " to removing democratic control from the hands of the people .
Thank you Ireland .
We have always maintained that .
Let us just think about what we have in common and what we want to achieve together .
Madam President-in-Office , you mentioned the Middle East road map .
The instrument of ratification is being lodged in Rome today .
Mr President , I do not blame other European governments for ignoring the decision of the Irish people .
The Irish Government themselves have ignored the mandate that they clearly got from the people .
Enlargement can go ahead , but we want it to be fair and equitable .
That is not acceptable .
That is not so .
So exactly how do things stand right now ?
That is taking a huge risk .
The Irish people has spoken on Nice and its decision will be respected .
For them it will be expressed through their democratically elected parliaments .
They must not be denied that right .
We now need a sustained debate on Nice .
That is a proposal which I tabled in December 2000 after Nice .
I thank the Swedish minister here this morning for her confirmation that there is going to be a convention .
In conclusion , the rights of each Member State and each person who lives in Europe must be guaranteed .
That can best be done through a new federalism based on a European constitution .
So far , we have only the vaguest outline of what that might represent .
That is a disgracefully long time .
Why are they acting so cowardly ?
Why is Sweden scrapping sustainable development even before the Summit has started ?
That is irresponsible and it calls for plain language and decisive action from our Heads of Government in Gothenburg .
And I also want to acknowledge this .
I believe that you have acted with political care .
And we must take our share of the blame , Madam President-in-Office , for the situation in his country .
They have for a number of reasons declined these changes .
The Nice Treaty must in time cease to exist .
In these circumstances no treaty in these circumstances is better than a bad treaty .
Europe and its institutions can only be built with the long-lasting support of its peoples .
First and foremost , sustainability .
As we specified in Parliament ' s decision , sustainability must be seen in a global context .
And now a couple of words about enlargement .
We must be careful of rhetoric .
Finally , we must be committed to the Middle East peace process .
I feel that the European Union will be able to play a major role in this matter .
So what are the Irish saying by abstaining so heavily ?
I am confident that the Union can rise to this challenge .
I am very pleased about the widespread support in Parliament for enlargement .
You will also continue to have a key part to play in moving enlargement forward .
Of course we will take the referendum in Ireland seriously .
We must become better at obtaining more grassroots support for European issues and the European project .
We must take the referendum result seriously .
It is a common responsibility and common lesson for us all .
The Treaty of Nice is , of course , the precondition for enlargement .
It is also important for enlargement that the process of addressing the points at issue continues .
Many people have also mentioned sustainable development and the environmental issues .
I can guarantee that we will stand by the Kyoto Protocol .
We will do our best in Gothenburg to ensure that we take important steps forward on environmental issues .
We have seen the way the EU can play an important role .
Naturally , this work must continue .
Finally , I would like to thank everyone for the kind words on the Swedish Presidency .
( Applause )
Mr President , a brief response to some of the points that have emerged during the debate .
My answer relates to the Commission 's statements .
This is what we have done thus far and this is what we will do in the future .
I would like to take the opportunity afforded by this brief answer to make two observations .
In this connection , I would also like to thank Mrs Diamantopoulou for her work .
In my view , these are the methods that we must always use .
Finally , we must also take the lesson of the Irish referendum and the subsequent deliberations to heart .
The European peoples want and must have an incisive , ambitious project on which to express their opinion .
Thank you very much , Mr Prodi .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
We have concluded this morning ' s debates .
I therefore suspend the sitting until the vote at 12 noon .
( The sitting was suspended at 11.33 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon ) .
We shall take note of what you say , Mr Nogueira .
( Parliament approved the Commission proposal )
Procedure without debate
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Before the vote on the fourth indent of the preamble
Blokland ( EDD ) .
I suggest that that should be added .
( Parliament agreed to take into consideration the oral amendment )
Before the vote on paragraph 8
I hope it is clear that this renders the text more specific .
I hope that this is noted before we hold the final vote .
Of course , this is a most important linguistic correction , which will be noted .
So we do not need to vote on it as it has been duly recorded .
Madam President , the text reads " Macedonian government " .
This is an oral amendment and we should ask if there are any objections to it .
( Exclamation by Mr Posselt : ' No , that is not true ! ' )
So it is in that spirit that we have made this change .
It really does not need to be put to the vote .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
These linguistic shenanigans are in fact political points .
Otherwise what we put in before was also a linguistic correction .
There was a linguistic error in the text , which has now been corrected .
Madam President , I think Mr Posselt is quite right .
Madam President , I do not like the result of this vote .
Could we have it again , and maybe set up a forum to discuss it first ?
That is what we are asking the Irish people to do on this issue .
The correction in question is designed purely to make the text consistent .
That is obvious .
I therefore assume responsibility for the vote that has been taken .
( The President declared the amended common position approved )
( The President declared the two common positions approved )
Before the vote
In my opinion this is unsatisfactory .
Thank you , Mrs Kauppi . I agree with you that this is quite unacceptable .
Thank you for your understanding and I will ensure that it never happens again .
Before the vote on Amendments Nos 47 , 48 and 49
Therefore I should like to read out the English-language text , which refers to radio and television broadcasts .
I believe that is not clear in every language .
Certainly , Mr Harbour .
In that case , we will , of course , make the necessary checks .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Loud applause )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions in successive votes )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Madam President , I refer to paragraph 21 of the Brok report .
We voted on this paragraph and I rather thought that we rejected it .
But you say that this paragraph was adopted .
Could you please check exactly what happened ?
Mr Sakellariou , I have had it confirmed that it was adopted by a large majority .
I am sorry , but we cannot re-take votes .
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Gothenburg European Council
The wording of paragraph 23 is therefore incorrect .
I therefore hope that we will genuinely take this path .
Madam President , I voted against this resolution .
I do not support the militarisation of Europe .
I feel the point was not made strongly enough .
It seemed to accept the missile defence system .
Just asking to be kept informed about it is not enough .
We should not go along with the US missile defence system .
In general I feel this resolution points in the wrong direction .
It supports the militarisation of Europe - something I do not support .
I voted " against " .
That is quite undemocratic and most regrettable .
That is why I say clearly that it is a big mistake to exclude all these people .
It is regrettable that we have made the same mistake today .
Their reactions show exactly where the limits of civic democracy lie .
The motion for a resolution by the European Parliament not only accepts these guidelines , it goes even further .
Perhaps they think that decisions taken by Eurocrats alone are more democratic ?
But these individual explanations do not suffice .
On the contrary , we must give the nations greater powers .
Of course , this remedy would only make things worse by reinforcing the supra-national aspect .
. The Irish ' No ' was not a ' No ' to enlargement .
Not one political party campaigned against enlargement .
Only one non-party organisation did so .
The Irish people have spoken on Nice and their decision will be respected .
For them it will be expressed through their democratically elected parliaments .
They must not be denied that right .
I believe that can best be done through a New Federalism , based on a European Constitution .
So far , we only have the vaguest outline of what that might look like .
However , there are elements of the resolution that I did not agree with .
In a democracy , the results of a move such as this must be respected .
We urgently need to reduce the democratic deficit between the citizens and their representatives .
But basically , they still come from the top down and they represent the wrong Europe
This is why we have abstained in the vote .
For the first time , environmental issues are the main issue before the European Council this week in Gothenburg .
Serious consideration must be given to the Irish decision to vote against ratification of the Treaty of Nice .
We must reassess the way the Union works and increase openness .
To pretend now that the Irish ' no ' to Nice prevents enlargement is a nonsense .
It is the Treaty of Nice that creates the problem here .
However , I share the view expressed in paragraph 32 .
. Madam President , I very much look forward to the outcome of the Göteborg European Council .
It marks the end of an impressive presidency by the Swedish Government and I congratulate my Swedish colleagues .
The Göteborg meeting of the Heads of State and Government will primarily be about enlargement .
The most important issue for this summit is to achieve a breakthrough in the enlargement negotiations .
The challenge for Europe in the 1980s was to build a single market .
The challenge in the 1990s was to create a single currency .
Environmental issues are a top priority for our citizens across the European Union .
After all , it is a good story to tell .
Recommendation for second reading by Mr Davies ( A5-0187 / 2001 )
Madam President , I was happy to vote for the directive on ozone .
I therefore hope that the European Union will genuinely continue to work to combat air pollution .
For it is young people who are the main victims .
That , at least , is what we hope and what we wanted to express through our vote .
Recommendation for second reading by Mrs Redondo Jiménez ( A5-0179 / 2001 )
Harbour report ( A5-0202 / 2001 )
Lulling report ( A5-0181 / 2001 )
Because , if not , something needs to change .
Madam President , who is it that deals with statistics in the companies ?
The part of Mrs Lulling 's report which relates to young people is therefore important .
I cannot stress this enough and I would like to say that we voted for the text .
Torres Marques report ( A5-0149 / 2001 )
Here too , at last , is an attempt to improve the regulation of electronic signatures on invoices .
They have to be signed by a certain number of people , for example 500 thousand citizens .
This would be a sign of greater democracy in the nations of Europe .
Madam President , I agree fully with what Mr Fatuzzo has said .
Miller report ( A5-0194 / 2001 )
It replaces 15 different national rules governing VAT invoices with one simple set of rules .
The Single Market is essential for jobs in the North West of Britain .
I and my Labour colleagues are determined to make the Single Market work for British business .
Madam President , I abstained in the vote on this document .
That is why we abstained on this report .
Brok report ( A5-0207 / 2001 )
I place my trust in those young people and I hope that the European Union will do the same .
Make way for the young people of those countries !
Fourtou report ( A5-0186 / 2001 )
Yet the resolution also has a very negative aspect .
I therefore abstain on this resolution .
You don 't use them , do you ? "
" What are you saying ? " she replied .
" I would never use silicone breast implants because I have absolutely no need of them .
My Group welcomes the recommendation for further , more specific research .
We also welcome the recommendation for a minimum age for such surgical intervention .
I trust that the Commission communication will include the recommendations of this House .
By using silicones it is possible to improve their physical appearance .
France has now banned the implants , but other Member States are wavering and indecisive .
I have voted against the proposal .
If nobody else wishes to speak , the sitting is suspended .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Working time in mobile road-transport activities
Furthermore , separate agreements have been reached in the maritime and aviation sectors .
It therefore applies to the self-employed , and rightly so .
We cannot exclude the self-employed .
The answer to that , of course , is that it must be .
However , even this poses difficulties .
Therefore , that is also an important point .
In conclusion , the key element is that of the inclusion of the self-employed .
Mr President , we support this directive .
I will not deny that there was a lengthy debate about specific points .
Secondly , competition .
That does not mean it is not still open to discussion .
The PPE-DE Group will not be supporting two of the points .
This figure is increasing by 20 % per year .
Why are we only going to take account of the risk facing a minority of these drivers ?
' Are the self-employed not people ? ' , as Mrs Smet asked .
Of course they are .
Why forget about the majority ?
Do those drivers and citizens who use the roads not face identical risks ?
Let us be serious .
Independent workers are not another race .
In fact , they have more work to do than the salaried workers .
Secondly , because compliance with the rules cannot be monitored or enforced .
They are therefore unnecessary , and the liberal group is always opposed to such legislation .
Thirdly , there is sufficient national legislation . Even the Common Position is giving this due consideration .
It is in the interest of the internal market that a European framework be created for that purpose .
But the transport sector also consists of many small , self-employed drivers .
They are independent businesses with one or two lorries which service a vital segment of the market .
There are other reasons for long delays .
Finally , the definition of working time is far too detailed .
Here too , the liberal group has chosen to subscribe to the common position .
You will gather from my speech that there are a few additional aspects which I have not mentioned .
I cannot explain those rules to the voter .
The liberal group will be voting against the relevant amendments and in favour of the common position .
Those large ones employ staff and the small ones do not .
That was mentioned a moment ago .
This also leads to cowboy pricing , if I can refer to it that way .
The sector is repeatedly up to new tricks .
That would not be the first one .
We have already closed the Willy Betz loophole .
For that reason , we believe that this gap must be closed .
This has been a relatively long time coming .
It is very good that this category is now being covered .
Our group also believes that it is obviously necessary to put employees and drivers on an equal footing .
We do not want this sort of cheating in the industry .
Our group has tabled two amendments .
We believe that the transposition period of three years is unnecessary .
Mr President , overall , we feel that the rapporteur 's good work deals exhaustively with the issue .
However , we would like to comment on the proposal regarding the definite inclusion of the self-employed .
We feel that it would be appropriate to include the self-employed in the new directive from the start .
There are various different causes which have a bearing on the matter .
I am sure that is true .
This morning I chaired a press conference here on the subject of burdens on business .
There is no requirement on Parliament to tighten up this legislation now .
They also show no understanding of the needs of the industry , or its employees .
These last three sentences are not my words .
They are the words of the UK Road Haulage Association .
UK Conservative MEPs will be rejecting all the Hughes amendments .
We shall not be alone .
There is hardly a sector in which this is more pertinent than the transport sector .
I should like to reiterate the objective of this directive .
I cannot believe that they will agree to this .
However , Mrs Smet , this calls for intelligent logistics .
Mr President , I congratulate Stephen Hughes on his report .
Consequently , it is also important that we include self-employed workers .
I know that Mr Hughes was talking about a 24 hour period .
I sincerely hope we are going to vote for this directive and include self-employed workers .
The report 's conclusion also refers to achieving a level playing field with other transport sectors already covered .
Therefore I cannot fully support the more restrictive proposals in this report .
There are areas that are open to improvement .
For instance , in Ireland 98 % of what is manufactured is transported by road .
We have a fast growing economy .
It depends on a flexible and innovative transport industry .
Amendment No 17 would impose additional obligations on Member States and would be difficult to implement .
In Amendment No 19 there is a call for harmonisation of penalties .
This is not something we should agree with .
And because another objective must be to prevent unfair competition .
I believe that the Directive must include self-employed workers .
And self-employed are workers in every sense of the definition .
Mr President , I welcome the Hughes report and the reasonable balance that he has achieved .
It is a tribute to his political skill .
It is pointless to argue that a self-employed driver might be less fatigued than an employed driver .
From my own personal experience , the reverse is in fact true .
It is also important to tighten up the definition of " self-employed " .
We have seen too much abuse of this loose definition of " self-employed " in other areas of work .
The area of application of the directive is the most essential question in this whole matter .
The compromise achieved in the Council leaves self-employed hauliers outside the scope of the directive .
In my opinion Parliament should also approve this compromise .
Mr President , the central issue of this legislative proposal is the inclusion of self-employed workers .
In that respect , she has achieved more than her predecessor .
I hope we will bear this in mind when we deal with other matters too .
I believe that his novel was also about whether one should work on Christmas Day .
This is now given fresh relevance .
I believe it is important that a common position has been reached .
Those who claim that we should adopt the common position without question are disempowering this Parliament .
Surely they can understand that .
Mr President , Commissioner , allow me to start by quoting the early German Romantic Novalis .
He was quite right .
This insight is something we come up against almost every day in the European decision-making process .
Mr President , today is a great day for road haulage contractors .
However , why is it that we do not use the Hughes procedure for the Hughes report ?
That said , let us get to the point .
Hudson Bay , 40 years ago , it is cold and foggy .
The Andrea Doria is approaching New York .
It may be that , if they had had shorter working hours , this would not have happened .
We do not want our lorries and motor vehicles to go the same way as the Andrea Doria .
You have no right to reply .
I now give the floor to the Commissioner , Mrs de Palacio .
As you know , this directive has a special significance for me .
A driver ' s degree of tiredness does not depend on whether he is self-employed or on a salary .
Please have no doubt that that is my position .
And , although self-employed drivers are excluded , it is a step forward .
Many thanks , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
Mr President , Commissioner , this problem is double-edged .
But we should , at the same time , control the risks involved .
After the accident involving the Erika , we took rapid action .
Secondly , we must introduce automatic report duty via transponders .
On that score , I have developed the Commission proposal in a little more detail .
That happens far too little at the moment .
We must legislate for that .
Thirdly , the black box .
Fourthly , the ban on departure in adverse weather conditions proposed by the Commission .
Each port or each ship is different .
There are examples of this in France and in the Netherlands .
I have added a provision concerning fuelling at sea , which is also a difficult operation .
It is dangerous .
We must therefore do something about this .
One of the options is to restrict bunkering , and even ban it in bad weather .
We have added a provision to that effect .
Fifthly , ports of refuge .
The proposal will now be presented to the Council .
I hope that the Swedish Presidency will be able to deal with the matter later on this month .
However , I fear that the proposal will end up with the Belgian Presidency .
The real safety work is done at sea .
Of course , the Commission 's proposal initially provoked several questions .
The main problem with these two funds is still their ceiling of EUR 200 million .
It would be managed by the Commission , assisted by a committee of Member State representatives .
Indeed , the conventions on which this extension depends have yet to be ratified .
So , does the European Parliament really want this fund ?
This really is urgently necessary .
We must assume our responsibilities .
Should we engage in drawing-room discussions of environmental theory , or should we establish , without delay ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
However , I shall confine myself to the three reports which are the subject of today 's debate .
First , I should like to thank our rapporteurs , who have done an excellent job .
Not just their health , but their rest times and suitable working conditions .
So we have tabled the relevant proposed amendments .
We want people at national and local level to sit on the board .
And we also want this agency to be accountable and to publish regular information on what it does .
We consider this to be absolutely self-evident .
Why should it not be funded by everyone involved in the fuel transport sector ?
We think this is the right way forward .
That is why we propose that it be raised to two billion .
We must ensure that this does not delay the first process .
This concept of liability was not defined clearly enough in our legislation .
What is being applied here , and applied fairly , is the polluter-pays principle .
The Commission seems suspicious of its own proposal .
I do not understand for what reasons the Commission wanted to place the future agency under its tutelage .
There remain , however , two points in this proposal with which I am not satisfied .
The Council is the Community co-legislator and the other arm of the budgetary authority alongside Parliament .
We have worked hard to give the European Union a single air space .
I should like to start by outlining the context within which the following proposed amendments are set .
The third proposed amendment contains provisions governing the adoption of the agency 's budget .
We must ensure that the Agency is not given too much independence .
I will confine my remarks to the Esclopé report .
Both of these are unlikely to be ratified in the foreseeable future .
That is why they need to be addressed in this report .
Thirdly , there is in equity in terms of the responsibility for meeting the costs .
That is something that we can address at second reading .
But in essence what we have tried to do is to rectify that inequity .
His suggestion of a tri-partite committee is well-meaning , but inadequate .
We should be proud of this achievement and support it .
I should like to offer the rapporteurs my warmest thanks .
That is why it makes sense to opt for a more comprehensive approach here .
I think it makes sense to make a start on maritime safety by setting up an agency .
( heckling : or Greifswald , Rostock )
Mr President , I too would first like to thank the rapporteurs for producing successful reports .
The circle of people entitled to compensation and the accidents for which compensation is payable must not be extended .
However , those suffering from oil damage must receive full compensation for the loss caused by the damage .
The European oil pollution compensation fund is not the only way of solving problems .
For example , issues of responsibility must be addressed at global level .
That does not mean that we are not actually sometimes the cause of those delays ourselves .
So far there has been no mention of this or uniform European approach here .
This , too , is something the Commission should take into account and include in subsequent action .
I commend all three rapporteurs for their work on this important subject .
I would like to address myself in particular to the setting up of a European maritime safety agency .
It is not enough to agree on a set of rules .
I welcome the proposal for four representatives on the board to be appointed by Parliament .
I would call on the Council once again to study Parliament ' s constructive contribution .
Back to today .
The proposals which the Commission has prepared in this second package are also valuable .
I can therefore support most elements in this package .
The navigation system is an important element .
The rapporteur has found a prudent solution for the first point .
The existing international compensation system leaves a lot to be desired in terms of speed of action .
Therefore , this extension does not receive my backing .
It is therefore important for the Agency to be staffed with highly qualified personnel from the Member States .
Did he underestimate the scale of the disaster ?
Or did he think it would be pointless to return ?
By contrast , our other leaders were very active .
They all vowed , rather belatedly , that this would never happen again .
Naturally , the large American oil groups welcomed this happy initiative .
A year and a half later , all this activity has brought no real improvement .
Compensation of victims is almost non-existent .
Only 6 % of the available money has been paid out .
As for our coasts , they continue to be polluted by thousands of ships carrying dangerous waste .
What solution do the three reports before us today propose ?
Compensating the victims ?
The maritime safety of our countries ?
But freedom is not licence , and we should be quite clear about that .
Yet , the threats are not only environmental .
Any ship can , therefore , enter our territorial waters .
Tomorrow they could just as easily be carrying weapons or terrorist groups .
They have on occasion shown eye-witness accounts to be totally unreliable .
To put it simply , a ship fitted with a black box is a safer ship .
First , lessons can be learnt and they can be learnt accurately .
Therefore the VDR is , if anything , a preventive tool .
We would therefore support the Commission 's proposal .
We want action and we want it now .
The directive will also require Member States to determine ports of refuge for ships in distress .
That is not the case , but with time and experience , that is what it could turn into .
These voluntary players often make pertinent proposals and could be objective and constructive allies for the agency .
We think it is crucial to extend the compensation to include environmental damage .
We regret that .
I will confine my comments to two points I regard as crucial .
Secondly , we must go further on the question of compensation .
With regard to compensation , we very much need this initiative .
We have to listen to the victims , the elected representatives , the local associations involved .
They have a role to play in the management of the COPE Fund .
That is the reason for establishing the COPE Fund and that is why we are supporting this initiative .
Mr President , let us make the most of a good thing .
For once , the Commission is showing appreciation of the daily lives of European citizens .
These amendments therefore seem tainted and absurd .
I believe it is irresponsible to give a demagogical speech , ruling out any extra compensation .
I think it would be much more sensible to push this through quickly and to achieve practical results .
However , as in all human activities , it is practically impossible to guarantee complete safety .
For that we have the Commission , the Council and a whole range of organisations .
Of course , nothing of the kind has been proposed .
If the Council knows of a better way , then we are quite prepared to take it .
We also have an open mind about international regulations .
That is a contradiction in terms .
And we shall not be satisfied with the agency director 's head .
We are your partners , Commissioner , and we shall get along just fine .
The first aspect is the emptying of tanks .
In this respect , there is a gap in the legislation , which must be filled .
A large proportion of today ' s traffic , particularly in northern Europe , uses the rivers .
What is going to be done about this ?
The third point concerns controls .
A few months ago , the Samina sank in the Aegean .
Finally , there are two points on which I have reservations .
I would also emphasise the contributions of the three rapporteurs .
With regard to the COPE Fund , it is , as has already been said here , a supplement .
Beyond this , many other risks remain .
The timeliness and the objectives of the agency have also already been discussed here at some length .
I think that Lisbon is probably the most appropriate .
A large fleet is an advantage , of that there can be no doubt .
But it entails a great deal of responsibility .
They were all very quick to promise that they would transpose the relevant acquis into their national law .
That alone was cause for concern .
The present Member States can do a great deal to help here .
We could apply this model here too .
There are already more than enough concerns and fears on the question of enlargement .
I almost said there are a lot of Irish among us .
The Commission should monitor the agency and we should monitor the Commission .
As an Austrian , I unfortunately have no high-sea ports to offer .
We lost our last sea battle a hundred years ago .
Oil catastrophes have concretely shown that relying on good luck costs society dear .
The Erika II package under discussion therefore deserves all possible support .
I would like to congratulate all three rapporteurs for drawing up thorough reports .
Greek justice is taking action .
I believe we must mark out territories .
It is the Member States who have all the responsibilities in the criminal field .
We are not prepared to accept this .
Furthermore , I agree with what Mr Esclopé has said .
But since there is already an international proposal , I believe that we should not be too hasty .
The perfect is the enemy of the good .
It would not make sense to compensate those responsible for the pollution .
All the others , either in their entirety or in part , can be accepted .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be held tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Occurrence reporting in civil aviation
However , we must all work to ensure that air accidents are reduced to a bare minimum .
That is why I welcome this European Commission proposal .
My second concern referred to Article 2 and Annexes I and II .
The lists of examples of reportable occurrences may need to be addressed .
My third point referred to Article 4 .
This would need to be amended as there could be circumstances in which gross negligence is involved .
I would like to thank Mr Collins for producing a comprehensive report .
It was a great pleasure to work with him .
I should like to suspend the debate at this point .
We shall resume the debate on this item at 9 p.m.
Question Time ( Commission )
Question No 32 by ( H-0455 / 01 ) :
The needs of women and children are specifically addressed in mother-and-child health programmes .
Usually , NGOs also provide their female patients with elementary hygiene education .
These projects are implemented in areas where internally displaced people have settled .
For instance , ACF employs between 55 and 65 per cent of women in its medical programmes .
Medical NGOs play an important role in the professional training of women .
We also carry out Food-for-Work projects .
Income-generating activities for women , which encourage self-sufficiency , are increasingly supported by ECHO .
They are paid a fixed rate in wheat seed every two weeks .
MEDAIR is in the process of implementing a second phase .
Even in shelter programmes women are involved .
Unfortunately , this general state of affairs is escalating , as we can read in press reports now .
I am planning to visit Afghanistan in September with a view to stepping up this effort .
We very much want to support them and be by their side .
Despite your detailed answer , I do have to ask you for further information .
Yesterday , they came here to Parliament once again .
We also know that there is no water irrigation system to combat it .
Nothing has been done for 20 years - there are no dams , for example .
We are , therefore , moving towards a decrease in aid and assistance to Afghanistan .
Even if this exists - you did mention this - should it not be better coordinated ?
What we are doing is making a relatively large-scale effort in terms of humanitarian aid .
This will be the focus of my efforts when I go there in September .
Question No 33 by ( H-0473 / 01 ) :
The amount needed has been estimated at $ 7-10 billion per year .
President Bush recently announced an initial US pledge of $ 200 million .
Is the Commission prepared to take the lead in this issue and contribute significantly to the fund ?
I will try to explain .
The Commission and Member States will explore how best to develop this initiative . "
There are a number of points we consider important .
First , we would wish to see a number of principles or conditions fulfilled .
I will name just a few .
One , donors should make available additional and new resources over an extended period of time .
The Commission does not have access to additional resources .
We have a specific budget .
This is crucial .
If all this is not helped by a fund , the fund is no help at all .
So , does it improve delivery ?
We have had enough empty donor-driven manifestations .
Six , the governing structure of the funds should be light and transparent .
Seven , the fund should be outcome-driven as opposed to input-focused .
Eight , decreased transaction costs for countries should be a priority .
Today this is something which we more or less agree upon .
But that is not how discussion about the fund started out .
This fund , however , will not be a UN organisation .
What is on the cards here is to ensure core funding for this fund .
Thank you , Commissioner Nielson , for a very full and in many parts interesting reply .
I also agree with many of the requirements for such a mechanism which Mr Nielson sets out .
I would also like to test Mr Nielson a little further .
This is also true in cases where countries choose to opt for treatment .
In a developing country , that is asking quite a lot .
The reality is not so easy .
They have been working on this for a year without much progress .
This is why it is not just an evasive response to lay stress on prevention .
I appreciate the response from Mr Wijkman .
It is true that these organisations need money .
We will come to this in the next question .
That is how we mobilise additional money .
It may also be possible to mobilise new private money .
We have real commitments that have not been translated into actions in terms of spending the money .
Most of the money is in principle committed - implementation is the real challenge .
These are the questions that we need to come back to .
I should like to ask him two supplementary questions .
First , as he said in his answer , there are many ongoing discussions .
We very much welcome the summit that was called by Kofi Annan .
That was more promising than many other things we hear from his government .
That said , we have expressed a strong desire to do so .
We thought we had eradicated it in western Europe , but it is re-emerging now .
This is a highly significant point .
It is absolutely feasible and it is an incredible pay-back .
For TB and malaria , the economics of the cure are very different .
This is the real issue .
There is good reason to give more attention to TB and malaria .
This was the main contribution of our action programme .
It was also supported by the round table last September .
I therefore welcome the contribution concerning TB .
Question No 35 by ( H-0461 / 01 ) :
In the final analysis , market trends will obviously be the deciding factor .
Imports of soya have increased , as have the prices .
Can you give us any assurance that there will not be any genuine speculation ?
How will the farmers be able to resist this ?
The food scares have plunged them into an economic crisis .
Less than 3 % is simply not enough to trigger huge speculation or somehow put the Community under pressure .
Question No 36 by ( H-0470 / 01 ) :
Under which Community funds will the new Restructuring Plan be financed ?
Obviously , the Commission works in close liaison with individual national authorities in such cases .
Commissioner , you have not answered my question .
You reply in a theoretical and impersonal way .
Please reply specifically to the question you are being asked .
I asked you : what amount are you going to provide ?
In Andalusia , there is enormous concern about this issue .
However , may I clarify exactly what we have to do here .
The legal bases stipulate that we are obliged to do exactly the opposite .
That is a fact .
That is the correct procedure and there is no alternative to it .
We will continue to work towards this in Parliament .
But my question has a different aim .
Is the Commission aware of these reports that are being published ?
They give names .
But I assume that you meant certain Moroccan forces were lining their pockets .
Is that correct , Mr Varela ?
Part of the negotiations involved earmarking these funds .
I think this needs to be the general model for the future .
Question No 37 by ( H-0445 / 01 ) :
The Commission has every reason to believe that Croatia will apply this legislation seriously .
Thank you for your response , Commissioner .
My own nation of Wales is a case in point .
That is certainly the case elsewhere in the current Union .
I am amazed at just how detailed the Commission 's replies have been .
It is something which I have never experienced in my 22 years as a Member of this House .
I am sure there is a reason for it , which I shall ponder on overnight .
I hope so too .
Question time is closed .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
Occurrence reporting in civil aviation ( continuation )
The proposed measure has a strongly preventive character .
It is therefore only logical that a legal framework be created at European level .
The future European Safety Agency could also stand to benefit from this .
The success of the proposed system will depend on the degree of its confidentiality .
Detailed information should only end up in the hands of relevant users .
After all , this is not about apportioning blame or liability .
The European Parliament ' s amendments are specifically intended to strengthen this element .
On the basis of evaluation , the lists of occurrences to be reported must be also be updated .
That is the purport of Amendment No 11 .
In my opinion , the public is entitled also to obtain that type of information .
How often do I read in the paper that one or other incident has occurred .
It is by no means always serious , but still .
We are therefore pleased with the support which our amendments received in the committee .
Mr President , we will be abstaining on this report .
Yet , the number of passengers and flights is constantly rising and they are rising increasingly quickly .
Staff cut backs are all the more shocking because the large airlines are making huge profits .
Companies will not become safer and more competitive if we hide these responsibilities .
We believe that customers have the right to be fully informed .
The continuing growth of air travel is causing pressure on air travel safety .
Safety precautions are essential .
The majority of accidents are due to human factors .
For this reason it is important to obtain information on the functioning of these services .
Each year , Member States must submit a report on the level of safety of civil aviation .
The safety of Europe ' s airspace is to everyone ' s benefit .
To be honest , I cannot understand it .
Thank you very much , Commissioner de Palácio .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
No type of administration should be outside this commitment .
EU rules are , of course , often criticised for being much too detailed .
Rules concerning employees ' health and safety are no exception .
Secondly , we must look at the requirements made of those products designed to improve scaffolding .
A third point is training .
Let us now see , however , how the Member States set about the task .
Fourthly and finally , there is the attitude to health and safety .
Legislation alone cannot prevent accidents of this kind .
We cannot have those who work on scaffolding playing Tarzan out on the work sites .
Thank you very much , Mrs Thorning ­ Schmidt .
The absence of rapporteurs from debates is something that must be pointed out .
The Bureau was , therefore , aware of this fact .
With regard to Mr Skinner , the Bureau was unfortunately not given any information or explanation .
Is safety in relation to scaffolding really a matter for the EU , however ?
This might be at a national or local level .
I think we need some new thinking .
This directive has finally provided a solution .
That is precisely where the whole problem lies .
For the time being , anyway .
I am only highlighting this issue . We have not solved the problem .
The directive causes problems of enforceability .
I now understand what Tony Blair means by Labour leading in Europe .
Furthermore , of this total number , around 40 000 serious accidents are recorded and around 1 000 deaths .
We can thank the chauffeurs ' service of Parliament .
It is a first .
There is nothing like this that has come through the processes of health and safety .
That may stagger you , but it is true .
It is true for various reasons .
But sense prevailed and now we have it back .
Five hundred thousand people each year fall from heights .
That is quite a staggering amount across the European Union every year .
That is quite a burden for business .
Yet we still persist in allowing accidents to happen in the workplace .
We should strive to do that in the most reasonable and practicable way .
I worked at heights .
I worked on scaffolding .
I worked on ladders .
I tried to carry things too large for people to be able to carry .
I have seen it .
Let me tell you these are not fly-by-night dreams of someone in Parliament .
Parliament has been incredibly successful in this process . It has been successful for many reasons .
These are not burdens .
I do not think that including self-employed people in this particular legislation is burdensome .
It seems remarkable that this could be so misrepresented .
Not all the amendments came from the Socialists .
It is not as if we were some devious clique involved in destroying businesses .
Amendments came from the other side of the House as well .
Let us not forget that .
You are criticising your own colleagues as well .
This is a very successfully arranged piece of legislation .
It has been achieved through consensus and goodwill in our committee .
I thank all the people who have been a part of that .
I hope we will be able to enjoy the success for many years to come .
Thank you very much , Commissioner de Palácio .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
European Union 's oil supply
I have only just got here myself as a shadow rapporteur .
Could we perhaps waste a little time ?
I am referring more to coincidence than to his personal responsibility .
For example , can you imagine life with no aeroplanes and no cars ?
Thirdly , Europe is totally dependent on oil imports .
This , of course , will exacerbate inflationary pressures .
Consequently , as it is a non-renewable source of energy , we should not waste it .
( The President cut the speaker off )
I doubt if this will be the case today because things have calmed down somewhat since .
What exactly is my point here ?
Obviously , people are getting used to higher prices .
The Commission published a communication back then , on which I should now like to congratulate it .
Not with fifteen , with one .
So where are the bones of contention , including here in Parliament ?
I am not so naive as to have overlooked this .
I think that we could well broker a compromise here .
The last point I want to mention here is planning policy .
Mr President , Mr Linkohr 's report is much to be welcomed .
It is precarious because we depend on supplies of oil from unstable parts of the world .
But more can still be done .
We must also pursue opportunities for saving energy , above all in the transport sector .
Yes , we must do what we can to promote renewable and alternative energies .
Yes , oil supply is a matter which has to concern us .
We must , therefore , take steps to reduce our dependence .
I am thinking , of course , of sources of renewable energy and biofuels .
Lastly , transport is a sector that deserves all our attention .
Our group supports the main points of the report .
In this context I would like to mention cooperation with Russia .
The Union should also seek more decisively than previously to replace oil with other sources of energy .
An important means of reducing dependence on oil is also saving energy .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Linkohr for a very fair report .
I agree on the importance of far-sighted policies .
This has been very short-sighted , as I am sure the Commissioner will agree .
What is even more important is the transport sector .
Here the emphasis on biofuels and renewable energies is most welcome .
We need to develop a new generation of vehicles .
Energy consumption in the transport sector is our greatest problem .
The report makes very welcome proposals here .
However , this is easier said than done .
There are solutions other than price management .
For example , it could be examined whether a greater surplus capacity in the refineries could offer solace .
Greater capacity can meet an increase in demand without the immediate need to put the prices up .
Natural gas and renewable energy sources can thus contribute to a greater diversity of supply .
Despite this , sustainability is more than simply promoting renewable energy sources in a focused manner .
National sustainability strategies provide the market with a variety of policies providing additional cover .
Specific national policies are then possible for each energy source .
That is why price management must not be the main issue of the dialogue .
The preconditions for a reliable and sustainable energy supply , on the other hand , should be .
Mr President , I congratulate my colleague , Mr Linkohr , on this report .
I should like to pick up on four points .
I would like to emphasise the importance of that initiative .
I support that paragraph .
This also must surely be a sensible policy to make the best use of our own resources .
These both have to be a sensible approach .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank Mr Linkohr for his excellent report .
By the way , who has ever heard of car-free offices ?
There is no such thing .
The rapporteur proposes more energy-efficient windows .
That is a good saving . It would save 20 % of oil .
We did this in Finland as far back as 25 years ago - triple glazing .
What next ?
Transporting energy is one problem .
I support local forms of energy .
These are the right solutions .
However , it is clear that these savings will not be achieved in time .
Renewable energy sources are not sufficiently fast .
There is an incredible amount of it there , more than in the Caspian Basin .
It could be the high point of the northern dimension .
Russia ' s partners are large and they are used to shortcuts .
They will enable us to gain speed and at the same time develop legislation .
There is nothing there except polar bears and silent Scandinavians .
This cooperation would work and would secure energy provision .
And this is the subject of this report .
Without transparency there can be no democracy , not even in Europe .
Protection of pigs
Just the subject for a midnight debate .
I should also like to thank the Commission and the Swedish Presidency for their very constructive cooperation .
That is also , of course , what the Commission has proposed .
We also have a duty to have definite rules adopted governing other pigs .
We have also tightened up the rules on training .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Busk on his excellent report .
It is up to farmers to follow the legislation through .
Mr Busk touched on two or three important issues .
I will reiterate them very quickly .
One of them was transport of animals .
But at the same time , I am of the opinion that the Council should also be here today .
I wanted to make this quite clear .
I will not elaborate on the content of the report .
Mr Busk made an excellent job of that .
We all know that animal welfare is an incredibly difficult issue in the WTO .
We could talk about this topic ad infinitum .
I have increasingly noticed that , sometimes , there is definitely a basis for an alliance .
On behalf of my group , I should like to thank both him and Mr Maat for their work .
But it is and remains just a compromise .
In the final analysis , every new legal framework has a huge impact on the people affected .
It is important here for us to have flexible transition times .
The conditions of competition are particular harsh in the pig production sector .
But I think this is the most practical solution .
As far as the timetable is concerned , I think we have found an acceptable compromise .
Holdings will have time to change their production methods over a fairly long period of time .
Finally , I call on the House to adopt the report as it stands .
But it must be said , Mr Busk , that you deserve our warmest congratulations on your work .
I will not beat about the bush : animals are animals and people are people .
Economic and ecological aspects need to be taken into account in the debate .
The geographical location of the farm also plays a part , as do structural requirements .
Development funds must be channelled to this sector because there is huge potential for investment .
My many years ' experience confirms precisely that .
Many of our proposed amendments refer to slot widths .
We almost make out that we are experts here .
We also need acceptable transition times for the whole business .
Neither is anything said about the health aspect of the animals .
I am delighted that we are reforming animal protection at European level .
Animal welfare must form part of our basic ethical philosophy .
However , this philosophy should not stop short at the borders of the EU .
That is the fact of the matter .
New animal protection standards also mean changes in farming systems .
Castration not performed correctly results in constant pain .
I would like , first , to thank Parliament for the priority given to this issue .
I very much welcomed the broad support expressed by Parliament .
The use of tethers for sows and gilts will be definitively forbidden .
I can accept Amendment No 13 because it improves the Commission proposal .
All of that will be dealt with under the issue of comitology .
It is for this reason that Amendment No 11 cannot be accepted .
The Commission is not blind to these implications .
That is 3.3 times the cost .
Amendment No 35 is unacceptable for legal reasons and because we have assessed the costs .
These amendments cannot be accepted .
These are legitimate issues , which deserve to be discussed on the international stage .
I am grateful for the constructive approach given to this dossier by the European Parliament .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Exceptional financial aid to Kosovo
( Laughter , heckling : cynic ! )
Allow me to get to the point , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf !
We need and we want to give money and we want to give it quickly .
We are more than prepared to do so but certain framework conditions have to be complied with .
This will be a particularly decisive question when elections are held in autumn .
How representative will these elections be ?
I refer in particular to the question of the mines in Trebca .
The problem which arises concerns the changeover to the euro .
We are talking simply about budget aid for the United Nations administration in the area .
Last year , the funding was 50-50 .
Another of your concerns was to know what is happening with the other donors .
Of course we are not considering an additional budgetary allocation .
First of all , we can quite readily accept some of the amendments .
I am referring to Amendments Nos 1 , 3 , 6 and 9 .
However , we are not talking about CART , but about something completely different .
I would like to comment on each of them .
A problem about which Mr Brok is particularly concerned is that of information .
Obviously we are prepared to provide all the necessary information .
Firstly , for the aid to be implemented within a maximum of six weeks .
For this reason we do not think that this request is correct .
Lastly , the Commission could accept Amendment No 14 if it were worded differently .
Thank you , Commissioner Solbes Mira .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
( The sitting was closed at 11.30 p.m. )
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
( The Minutes were approved )
I put it to Members that it is vital that we question the Commission effectively .
We are not doing this at the moment .
We are taking note of your comment and it will be duly considered .
Mr Andrews has the floor for a point of order .
Apparently , a contract has been signed by a new travel agency to replace Wagonlit .
Since I came to this House in 1984 , Wagonlit has provided an excellent service .
Travel for Members of this House is difficult enough without bringing in new agencies , without consulting Members .
Some of the best travel agents who have served the Members of this House are going to leave .
There should be more consultation when administrative changes of this kind are made .
It is yet another undermining of the services to which Members are entitled .
I have absolutely no interest other than the convenience of Members .
( The President cut the speaker off )
We are taking note of your concern and the Bureau of Parliament will consider the matter .
Mr Fitzsimons has the floor for a point of order .
Mr President , I wish to speak briefly on another point of order in relation to the Minutes .
Mr President , on a point of order .
It is really for them to look after Members ' interests .
I think he has the matter well in hand .
Mr President , I would like to raise two different points .
Thank you , Mr Bourlanges .
The correction that you have pointed out to us will be made .
Mrs Klamt has the floor for a point of order .
This appears to contravene French legislation .
Thank you , Mrs Klamt .
We will deal with the matter .
Mr Corbett has the floor for a point of order .
So we had half an hour to spare .
That time could have been used more profitably in this plenary session .
Thank you very much , Mr Corbett .
Distance , internal dispersion and climate have been significant obstacles to their development .
The aim was to promote sustainable development and strengthen job-creating production sectors .
In the fisheries sector , three Member States are affected ; Spain , Portugal and France .
I tabled one in particular , which was adopted by the Committee on Fisheries .
My amendment and the amendment tabled by the Committee on Fisheries are therefore based on this ' exception ' .
In my view , this amendment to the report is essential .
Lastly , there are Amendments Nos 7 and 8 , which raise the issue of non-retroactivity .
This issue was raised at the meeting of the Committee on Fisheries .
The amendment is still on the agenda , since it was re-tabled .
If this turns out to be absolutely impossible from a legal perspective , the law will settle the affair .
It was therefore a totally reasonable proposal .
I shall remind you of some aspects of the opinion approved in the Committee on Budgets :
Community support must be strengthened and not reduced ;
I have a few comments , however , to make with regard to some of the points .
Lastly , I would like to end with a wish .
Mr President , I wish to speak on the Poignant report .
Commissioner Fischler has quite rightly referred to this problem as the ' scourge of the oceans ' .
I urge everyone here today to support this amendment .
Mr President , the peripheral regions of the European Union are in a vulnerable situation .
Although I can fully understand his concern for the working population , such concern is short-sighted .
One way or another fleet capacity must be reduced .
The Dutch fleet has a capacity that is nominally too large for the allotted fishing area .
Such a scheme makes it possible to modernise and improve the safety level of the fleet .
Only at this price and under these conditions are we able to protect our traditional tropical products .
Increasing the existing ceilings for the contribution of some Community funding is , therefore , a positive step .
On the other hand , some of the restrictions introduced by the Commission must be removed .
Although the rule of co-financing can be retained , it certainly must be modified .
Since this provision is non-reciprocal , it will lead to unfairness .
Can the Commissioner explain to me why this is not being done ?
The sector affected , which is a large sector , has more questions than answers about its future .
This is a fundamental issue for fishing in Réunion .
I would ask you to support these proposals and the two amendments that I have re-tabled .
I would also like to thank Mr Martínez Martínez and congratulate him on his work .
I should like , if I may , to quote a few statistics on the disadvantages of these regions .
The first proposal relates to contributions by the Structural Funds .
I can agree with many of the proposed amendments , provided that we find the right wording .
I also agree that these measures should enter into force with retroactive effect from 1 January 2000 .
However , the Commission stands its ground on the legal basis .
Now to the agricultural part of the POSEI programme .
So what are the most important considerations ?
I shall finish , if I may , by listing the points on which I can agree .
Finally , the transitional regulations should be strengthened in order to guarantee continuity .
Again , I cannot agree to apply Article 292 ( 2 ) here .
Now briefly to the fisheries reports .
The first two proposed amendments concern the legal basis .
I can accept the third proposed amendment .
Amendments Nos 4 and 6 concern problems with fish and flags of convenience .
These problems were raised during the debate .
We shall be sending a proposal to Parliament and the Council within the next few days .
I can accept Amendments Nos 7 and 8 .
Then briefly to Mrs Fraga Estévez 's report .
This proposal is the first in a package of measures ordered by the European Council in Nice .
I think this is justified for social reasons .
Thank you .
I would like to make it clear that the Quaestors were not consulted about this change .
I feel the noise in this Chamber is an absolute disgrace .
I know all the Presidents try desperately to stop it .
We cannot continue to allow Commissioners to be treated this way .
I entirely agree .
Something needs to be done about it .
It sets a disgraceful example .
I do not know what the people in the public gallery must think of this House .
Thank you , that was clear and helpful .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution ) President .
That concludes the vote .
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Report Hughes ( A5-0196 / 2001 )
Thank you very much , and please pass on my regards to your mother .
I voted against all the amendments .
the inclusion of self-employed truck drivers
the definition of the working times and standby duty
the definition of night work
. ( NL ) Labour is still a commodity .
This helps them avoid having to take on more people to share tasks .
Only a well-coordinated campaign by government and trade unions can help put a stop to this .
Report Skinner ( A5-0156 / 2001 )
This is an area in which the EU should not have such a great influence .
Our basic attitude towards the European Union is positive .
This is not one such area .
Detailed regulation is not the right way .
However correct and well-intentioned this may be , it cannot fall within the competence of European politics .
Report Sterckx ( A5-0208 / 2001 )
- ( DA ) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of an improvement to maritime safety .
Many pollution accidents could have been avoided if there had been better safety .
We have seen all too many accidents during the last couple of years .
Ship owners do not think that a black box has anything to do with safety .
However , that is not the case .
If we become better at discovering the causes of accidents , we also become better at preventing them .
We cannot wait for international rules in the IMO .
The EU must take the lead in the IMO by adopting better rules .
We cannot compromise on safety .
By the same token , the inspections must be carried out by a sufficient number of properly trained staff .
Report Sterckx ( A5-0208 / 2001 ) and Mastorakis ( A5-0205 / 2001 )
What we need now is for these measures to be implemented .
Report Mastorakis ( A5-0205 / 2001 )
That is where my love of the sea and fascination with ships started .
Where safety at sea is concerned , it seems appropriate to address the issue at European level .
This agency is also something that almost all operators in sea-related industries want .
This is why we are tabling several amendments , which seek to improve on the initial proposal .
It is also reasonable that the agency should produce regular reports on the results of its actions .
Report Esclopé ( A5-0201 / 2001 )
Most of the victims have still not been compensated .
This is why we are tabling amendments .
Report Collins ( A5-0203 / 2001 )
At the same time , all such information is to be treated in confidence .
Especially since the volume of air traffic is expected to spiral in forthcoming years .
Report Busk ( A5-0210 / 2001 )
. ( DE ) Animal welfare is part of our basic ethical understanding .
Not only people and their environment but also animal welfare is sacrificed to the free market .
National rules for protection are brushed aside by great economic interests and European liberalisation .
The further liberalisation is carried , the more it works to the advantage of whoever produces cheapest .
The fact that poor working methods are used in order to be so cheap does not matter .
That saves space and hence costs .
Report Brok ( A5-0209 / 2001 )
The Western powers must realise that repairing what they destroyed is the least of the matter .
Report Martínez Martínez ( A5-0195 / 2001 ) and ( A5-0197 / 2001 )
We are in favour of aid , but under different conditions .
. ( PT ) The European Commission proposals for the revision of Poseima fall well short of meeting expectations .
Nevertheless , although I voted in favour of Parliament ' s position , I must make the following reservations :
Poseima has thus made a significant contribution to the maintenance of our agriculture .
The proposed revision of Poseima with the changes recommended by Parliament is highly positive .
I hope the Commission will accept the changes proposed by Parliament .
Report Fraga Estévez ( A5-0185 / 2001 )
I therefore voted for the report .
Report Galeote Quecedo ( A5-0199 / 2001 )
Report Linkohr ( A5-0163 / 2001 )
Clear skies , swallows flying in from all around , calm seas , incredible sunshine .
Are we perhaps in Italy , Mr President ?
We are in Sweden , on the beautiful island of Gotland .
The explanatory statement also states that price increases are basically the result of speculation .
It is untrue that the public authorities could not ban price increases .
The Commission is incapable of taking the measures that are required and is content to reel off hollow phrases .
We have therefore voted against this report .
This is why the Member States must do everything they can to reduce their consumption of fossil fuels .
In order to achieve this , one method open to us is to develop bio-fuels .
The more enlightened car manufacturers and oil companies are supporting this strategy .
That concludes the explanations of vote .
Direct support schemes under the CAP
I think Mr Cunha will be addressing this point .
In Portugal the proportion is , of course , much higher .
It is a cautious but realistic start , which I think is both reasonable and important .
Otherwise we might be encouraging absenteeism .
This is fundamental .
Aid to small farms cannot be calculated at the same basic rate as other aids .
The CAP aid schemes needed simplifying .
Despite the simplifications , we must guard against the risks of spoiling them or reducing their effectiveness .
The value of the Graefe zu Baringdorf report thus deserves recognition .
The Commission did not accept it at first , but then agreed to move in that direction .
In any case , we shall be supporting his report .
Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur .
I am pleased that the qualification has an environmental requirement .
This is a very important issue especially as far as the smallest farmers are concerned .
I see this as a very important point .
In any case , I support the report presented by Parliament .
The present proposal is the Commission 's answer to these complaints .
I am hugely in favour of simplifying the common agricultural policy .
Now to the individual proposed amendments .
It is true that , to an extent , we are in a transitional stage .
However , this transition has closed today for all surface area premiums .
As far as beef premiums are concerned , there will be a further increase next year .
I can confirm that .
In other words , it is not the Commission 's intention to disadvantage farmers .
Nor is there , however , any justification for increasing premiums through the back door .
Mr President , allow me to ask the Commissioner a question before the debate closes .
You said we would need another hundred million .
In other words they are minute .
That is another kettle of fish , however .
To make savings here is out of order , however .
He has that choice and will not be disadvantaged as a result .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
( The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
Biological and toxins weapons convention
The first item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
Then we shall be able to resolve these problems .
This is supposedly to protect the United States against attacks from so-called ' rogue states ' .
That mechanism is required urgently .
Reaching agreement on this will mean at last another success in the struggle against weapons of mass destruction .
Mr President , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction poses a major threat to the world .
The misuse of biotechnology for hostile purposes must be addressed straight away .
The use of biological and toxic weapons has to be tackled .
A legally binding protocol to strengthen compliance with the BTWC is a matter of the utmost urgency .
This means maintaining at the very least the measure currently outlined in the chairman 's draft text .
The Ad Hoc Group was created to resolve this issue .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Situation in the Central African Republic
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
I believe we can all agree about that here in Parliament .
Faced with this tragedy , the European Union cannot turn a blind eye .
The resolution condemns the presence of foreign armed forces , which happen to be Libyan .
There is more to it than that , however .
The events in the Central African Republic are also an extension of the war in Congo .
The Community 's cooperation is to be focused on the transport and health sectors .
This strategy may have to be reviewed in the light of recent events .
The resulting humanitarian crisis appears to be well identified and manageable .
They help to strengthen dictators , not democrats .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0451 / 2001 by Jules Maaten , on behalf of the ELDR Group , on the situation in Malaysia ;
B5-0427 / 2001 by Crisitiana Muscardini , on behalf of the UEN Group , on the situation in Afghanistan ;
B5-0459 / 2001 by Thomas Mann and Charles Tannock , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group , on Afghanistan ;
I am talking about human rights activists , lawyers and judges .
In the past , support for such people from the Guatemalan authorities has often been lacking .
That is what is threatening to happen now .
You probably know who I am talking about , Mr Rios Mont , at present speaker of the parliament .
Otherwise impunity would become a serious problem for the future of Guatemala .
I am quite sure that we in the European Union can do this .
Punishment is not always the crucial factor .
What is crucial is to bring out the truth .
In our opinion the indiscriminate nature of this amendment is not good .
The whole history of huge estates , owned by the capituleros , goes back much further .
Rigoberta Menchu is someone who appealed strongly to the indigenous population .
Someone like Rios Mont with his coterie of relations and contacts definitely belongs to those circles .
In that sense what we do here in the European Parliament is also of great value and significance .
I hope that the resolution will also be in honour of Rigoberta Menchu .
Electoral fraud in Chad
France has maintained a military presence in that country since independence .
The army printed the ballot papers and made the ballot boxes .
Is Deby aware that he is irrevocably bound to honour the agreements he has made ?
Nor are the European Cotonou resources unconditional .
The aid creates obligations but all the indications are that the president is trying to wriggle out of them .
The elections appear to have been heavily rigged .
Europe must make it clear to Deby that he cannot break his word with impunity .
We were also looking at human rights in that country .
It is right that we should not jump to conclusions .
The European Union should insist on this .
However , there are questions to which we demand answers .
Is it true that children were seen with ballot papers ?
All these questions must be answered and accounted for .
That is our demand and it is the demand of the people of Chad .
We condemn these violations of fundamental rights in the strongest possible terms .
Is Idriss Deby in fact a new oil dictator ?
Parliament expressed its concerns about the pipeline project as early as January 2000 .
Unfortunately , recent events in Chad seem to have proved us right .
This may , as far as I am concerned , eventually lead to the cutting off of funding .
At the same time the international companies involved must take their share of the responsibility .
In Chad it turned into a real electoral hold-up .
The people of Chad have no faith in their democratic institutions and they have been proved right .
Reportedly no less than four and a half million out of six million inhabitants voted .
Voting cards were distributed .
They were sold .
The population in the north was artificially increased and that in the south artificially reduced .
In short , we cannot accept such a travesty .
We simply cannot take this .
In so doing we are depriving ourselves , our citizens and own democratic institutions of credibility .
I should also like to urge the French government most strongly not to shirk its responsibility .
It serves purely neocolonial ends and we cannot support it .
Mr Yorongar , who was tortured , is here with us .
I should like to pay tribute to him .
Nevertheless , in Egypt , rather strange things are happening .
The case of Mrs El Saadawi is typical .
Mrs El Saadawi is in danger of being sent to prison .
I think that it is Parliament ' s duty to react robustly .
We are fully aware , then , of who this woman is .
I would nevertheless remind you that divorce ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , Egypt is crucial to stability in the Middle East .
The country maintains important relations with the United States and Europe .
Unfortunately there is still no internal stability .
As long ago as 1967 a state of emergency was declared and has never been revoked .
Egypt is still far from being a democracy .
It lacks essential political freedoms and human rights are violated .
People are imprisoned without trial and tortured .
Show trials are still held .
The recent sentencing of the American sociologist Ibrahim fits very well into this poor picture .
It proves that jurisprudence is controlled by political motives and is unjust .
Stability means something else besides stripping people of rights .
The human rights situation in Egypt is giving rise to increasing concern .
Several other human rights defenders are also experiencing legislative and judicial harassment .
As for the torturers , they continue their ruthless acts with total impunity .
That is what is important .
By the same token , we take this opportunity to denounce the torture practiced in Egyptian police stations .
The European Parliament as a whole must take a stand against these barbaric practices of the Egyptian regime .
The reason for this draconian measure ?
Selim is campaigning for normalisation of relations between his country and the neighbouring state of Israel .
For that matter , Selim ' s expulsion does not come completely out of the blue .
The reason is plain .
Nevertheless Selim has so far visited Israel seven times .
True to his vocation , he published his Israeli travel experiences .
However , author Selim went further .
He spoke out openly in favour of an end to the present Palestine Intifadah .
In short , Selim 's exclusion was inevitable .
I should like to see the Commission also take action in this matter .
The latter in fact deals wholesale in the most fantastic anti-Israeli and anti-Western stories and / or accusations .
The Commission should also take the authorities in Cairo to task about this .
Mr President , this is an unnecessary and undesirable urgency debate .
Certainly it is premature , as Mr Dary said .
That is one of the this case .
If ' yes ' , I shall be pleased to support Paragraph 4 .
An answer please , Commissioner .
It can safely be said that he has since continued along the same path .
It is based on respect for the law .
This is particularly worrying because Malaysia occupies an important geopolitical position .
It is also an important country economically .
Above all , it is an important member of ASEAN , our partner community in South-East Asia .
Do the German Christian Democrats know something we do not ?
You said , Mr Posselt , that Karl IV was a Luxembourgois like Mrs Lulling .
I had always assumed that Mrs Lulling was a Luxembourgoise .
If I have misunderstood , please do enlighten me .
Mr President , I will not reply to Mr Purvis personally .
Unfortunately , the future , as indeed the past , is unlikely to prove him right .
The news is still fresh : the Taliban recaptured a town in the centre of Afghanistan .
The Sikh and Hindu minorities will be required to wear a yellow identification sign on their clothes .
Accordingly our group is submitting two amendments .
That might result in the NGOs being thrown out , which are the sole remaining source of information .
This would slow down the advance of the Taliban and especially bring them back to the negotiating table .
The current situation is difficult .
What are we to do ?
I believe that this strategy needs to be soberly appraised .
We need to review it again .
How should our embassies in Pakistan receive people who apply to be allowed to come to our countries ?
I have heard it said that they are sometimes treated like criminals .
We must also give our support to the Christian organisations that are working in Afghanistan .
There are Christian organisations that are doing an incredible amount for the Afghan population while maintaining a low profile .
They , too , need our support .
These are some of the measures that are needed .
We cannot get any further by condemning matters time after time .
One feels really powerless .
We need a more intelligent policy in this sphere .
Almost nothing has come of earlier promises to destroy poppy fields and opiates .
Drug dealing is used to fund campaigns by religious fanatics and international terrorism .
Until recently the focus has been on ensuring that Muslims behave in accordance with Islam .
It may be that we simply have to wait for things to burn themselves out .
Mr President , I shall deal first of all with the debate on the situation in Guatemala .
The Commission is closely monitoring the situation there .
The EU has been very supportive of the peace process in Guatemala , both politically and financially .
The cooperation programme with Guatemala is aimed at giving adequate support to the peace process .
At the same time the Commission is preparing a programme to improve the justice system .
The Council reportedly rejected the vote in some polling stations .
The situation is being closely monitored by the EU heads of mission on the ground .
However , it is recognised that these rights and liberties are not sufficiently respected by all actors .
It will be essential to address these issues in order to ensure sustainable peace in the country .
It has scrupulously avoided any intervention that might prejudice that expectation .
The European Commission is continuing to monitor the case closely .
There are also limited possibilities for an appeal .
The situation is being carefully monitored by the Commission .
The overall situation is complex and not entirely clear .
The Commission is deeply concerned at these events , which it considers contrary to established democratic practice .
They reinforce concerns already expressed in the past regarding the general human rights situation in Malaysia .
The Commission , like Parliament , is deeply disturbed by the ever-worsening humanitarian and political situation in Afghanistan .
They noted a reluctance to consider new peace initiatives .
Two things are clear concerning the future of Afghanistan .
First , outside involvement in the conflict in Afghanistan can only prolong the fighting .
Secondly , a military solution to the Afghan imbroglio is not possible .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
I think that the role of this delegation is crucial .
The facts on today 's Nepal .
Nepal is about the same size as Switzerland and Austria put together .
The flat land is overgrazed , the forests have all been cut down and ecological meltdown threatens .
What this country needs now is enlightenment .
These people also need our solidarity , they need hope and suggestions .
Tourism must not run dry , which is exactly what will happen if there is a civil war .
We must not abandon this country , which has so many friends in Europe .
Mr President , the death of the Nepalese royal family rocked the world .
We would like to tell the people of Nepal that they have our solidarity .
So if a delegation is to take part , it must be the SAARC delegation of the European Parliament .
The Maoist underground rebels have tried to grab this opportunity to destabilise the country still further .
Indeed , behind the drama a political process has been brutally called into question .
A link of confidence between the political class and its people has been broken .
It is a significant change in the balance of power in a region where instability reigns .
The European Union attaches great importance to respect for human rights and to democratic principles .
We must therefore roundly condemn the repression and arrests which followed the death of the king .
The Commission is dismayed by the dramatic events that are shaking Nepal .
As of today the situation remains volatile .
In this context the Commission deplores the arrest of three Nepalese editors of the Kantipur newspaper .
Our commitment stands firm .
It should be published before the summer break .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Situation in Angola
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
Mr President , this is the umpteenth time we have discussed Angola .
Surely we must ask ourselves the question whether sufficient efforts are being made for peace .
I consider this war to be making a mockery of our civilisation .
However , we see that the civilian population is being harassed time and time again .
There are the new minefields .
What cynicism !
Our final vote will of course depend on the direction this vote takes .
That was not our intention .
That is the major piece of news of the last few months .
We do not want just to cry over more deaths or lament further destruction .
Let us listen to the Angolans .
They know more and better than we do .
The Angolans want peace .
These are the voices we must listen to .
We must recognise their features , learn their names , publicise their faces , shake their hands .
We have to stop this monopoly of the bipolarisation of war .
These are the ones who can teach us a lot .
Angola is still suffering , but it does not have to be like that .
We need to introduce similar work that is just as ambitious .
We have all in our own way contributed to the tragedy .
There is no military solution to this conflict .
Today it is the European Parliament ' s turn to affirm it on behalf of the peoples of Europe .
The situation of Angola is a tragic situation .
Angola is a devastated country , which has experienced twenty-six long years of civil war without a break .
We do not agree and we have proposed an oral amendment which might be a compromise .
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Civil emergency protection
This mechanism therefore has to be very welcome .
In the other countries the civil protection service is more centralised .
Therefore it is vital that there should be a rapid , effective mechanism of this kind .
Giving these people the slightest amount of training would be of great help in tackling these disasters .
The Commission would like to avoid this and has therefore rejected this amendment .
The Commission rejects Amendment No 17 .
The references to the monitoring and information centre are a constructive contribution .
However , some of the wording is misleading and therefore needs to be revised or deleted .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Classical swine fever
Several amendments to this document have been tabled which your rapporteur feels deserve some comment .
I do not think either side will agree to this .
I therefore cannot accept Amendment No 35 .
As you can well imagine , this brought our meeting to an abrupt halt .
Amendment No 37 seeks to achieve a similar objective .
I would ask the House to reject both these amendments this evening .
In the UK we had stringent controls of swill feeding in place .
Of course you cannot legislate for human behaviour , however .
We have now banned swill in the UK entirely .
I urge the House to do the same across the whole of the EU .
I do not mean that we should resort to blanket vaccination in future .
However , greater importance should be attached to vaccination .
Another important point is the principle of regionalisation .
The European Union already applies this principle to third country imports .
Now third countries must return the favour .
Marker vaccines are very important here , as the rapporteur has clearly highlighted .
In addition the report points out the necessary modification of the guidelines .
That is a problem .
I myself come from Flanders .
That means that we ourselves are dramatically confronted with that problem .
I must honestly admit that in that respect I do not trust the industry .
The report has nevertheless convinced me that there has been a remarkable development in marker vaccine .
In any case the guidelines should provide regulation that makes mass culls unnecessary .
Unfortunately the discussion of the Redondo Jiménez report is ending in an anticlimax .
This Parliament speaks with two voices !
I have argued more than once in this Parliament that animals are more than production units .
They are creatures made by God , for whom we have responsibility .
Until 1980 , vaccination was commonplace in the European Union .
In order to meet the trade , the non-vaccination policy was implemented .
When will this Parliament start listening to its citizens ?
Infectious animal diseases , like swine fever , show the weaknesses of current agricultural policy .
These forms of agriculture are not less susceptible to livestock disease , on the contrary .
But we must begin and we must put down a marker now .
There has to be a better way .
The people of the European Union are demanding this .
Many farmers demand that there has to be a better method of control .
No one can convince me that we have got it right at present .
I do not believe we have .
Thank you , honourable Members .
This decision will be reviewed at a meeting of the Standing Veterinary Committee , scheduled for this week .
However , we must remain particularly vigilant in relation to this issue .
By means of this research very valuable information was obtained .
However , allow me to address in detail the amendments , which have been proposed .
I will begin with the amendments the Commission cannot accept .
I share the concern of the Parliament .
But these complex issues cannot be addressed in this directive .
The legal basis for doing so already exists in the framework of the common market organisation for pig meat .
Their co-ordination must be guaranteed to ensure proper eradication .
However , we will take into account Parliament 's remarks in a new recital .
While the Commission shares the views of the Parliament , it cannot accept these amendments .
On the other hand , the Commission can accept entirely or partially , a number of amendments .
In these cases , drafting changes are also needed .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
EEC / Comoros fisheries agreement
There is an increase in the overall number of vessels , which goes up from 60 to 65 .
As for the surface longliners , most are Spanish with a few from Portugal .
The main change in this section concerns the structure of this financial contribution .
The cost distribution of the agreement is also changed .
In real terms , the rate per tonne of catch goes up from EUR 20 to EUR 25 .
He had our full support .
But we have some reservations .
These vessels catch 40 000 tonnes of fish .
How can anybody have any control over what they do or what they bring back ?
That is my main concern .
Nevertheless I support the report .
