our prayers accompany him .
we are happy with it .

transformation is the key .
and in this government .
he is quite correct .
that was a joke !
the list goes on .
we truly are winners !
we must push harder !
there sits my father .
thank you for the information .
to say next then .
who said so ?
it demands greater tolerance .
incorrectly tabled .
it is your coalition .
i want to emphasise that .
that takes political will .
do the right things .
i thank them for that .
what criteria are used ?
time is running out .
that is greatly appreciated .
we recognise this .
this is vital .
they are astonishing improvements !
this is of enormous importance .
they see serious trauma .
i appreciate that in particular .
i certainly welcome that .
this is to be welcomed .
they are underfed as well .
we need them .
have we lost focus ?
that is very important .
there is a link .
we all know that .
i shall look into it .
deaths of innocent children
that is quite correct .
how much are we claiming ?
that is very important .
are there any objections .
i was born there .
no , not them .
you must read it .
how many are you going to give ?
we are contractually committed .
can he do sums ?
over three years , yes .
what about parow park ?
they go further , however .
i share his vision .
start the speech !
i have my speech .
what do we see , however ?
we are still waiting .
this is the problem .
he understands local government .
strange , is it not ?
what were his words ?
let me go further .
whom is he trying to bluff ?
i could say more .
he must learn that .
we have enough programmes .
you are talking rubbish , man !
they vote every time .
this is national legislation .
we looked at it .
that is very important .
it was very successful .
are there any objections ?
is there any objection ?
i want to contest that .
there are a number of reasons .
this is definitely painful .
what act is that ?
i am almost there .
i really appreciate it .
of course , he was wrong .
therein lies my problem .
in the lives of everyone .
ask the premier about it .
it is exactly the same .
i find that tragic .
i thank them for that .
they have supported it .
i put the motion :
i should like to proceed .
bill reported with amendment .
develop financial resources , and
they are becoming edgy .
the data has been captured .
we managed that .
what about the regulations ?
these points of focus deserve compliments .
that is local government .
give them more money .
labourers do the work .
and surrounding villages .
that is really good !
the closing date is past .
we shall try to help .
this is very interesting .
that is very interesting .
that is a dream .
i also do it .
i was there on monday .
we should like to help .
motion , as amended , agreed to .
who blocked it ?
how many tourists are there ?
how many jobs have you created ?
it is absolutely vital .
it is our child .
we created it .
we need to stand beside it .
we need to look at this .
i am being very kind .
the follow-up actions are looking promising .
i want to question this .
what does the community say ?
absolutely , we agree .
i would like to go on .
that is the dilemma .
we do not support that .
that is the practice .
the system is wrong .
why is this so ?
what are we doing about it ?
that is true , after all .
what did they do ?
the buildings are there .
bokkie fears the winter .
bokkie works overtime a great deal .
i am absolutely certain .
is there a declaration ?
that is an objection .
how do we deal with that ?
it is a query .
it is , therefore , agreed to .
is there any objection ?
are there any objections ?
are there any objections ?
are there any objections ?
employment of illegal immigrants
the premier 's opening address
we truly are winners !
we must push harder !
there sits my father .
what is the solution ?
it demands greater tolerance .
are there any objections ?
what are the solutions ?
the talking has finished !
implementation of the bill .
we support this legislation .
he was the spokesperson .
why is everybody blaming me ?
however , let me proceed .
look at the figures .
what is the point ?
something had to be done .
we have to deal with them .
violence on cape flats
shot after shot rings out .
this is my question .
this is his motion .
i am still waiting .
this is very important .
they are incredibly violent .
this is basic training .
that is the regulation .
is our defence force incompetent ?
i shall now conclude .
our members are active .
it is very laudable .
yes , i believe it .
that was the call .
they wanted to be paid .
they are all wrong .
what did they have to do ?
and what happened then ?
not one day .
let me repeat that .
i am coming to her .
we have done that .
what were we to do ?
we will come to that .
treasury approved this .
upon which the house divided .
three questions per vote .
we need to deal with that .
that ruling stands .
that is our suggestion .
i do want to proceed now .
that is one process .
what is the answer ?
we save every month .
we save every month .
and apologise .
and apologise .
they are our children . ( ?
you voted for it .
actually were involved in this .
are there any objections ?
was this wages ?
yes , i am .
i put the question .
that is the four .
that much i know .
are there any objections ?
that is easy to happen .
so what is it ?
can it be repeated ?
what is your question ?
that is a lesson .
is he satisfied with that ?
a connection is made .
gangs have existed for decades .
farm workers are proud people .
they have emotions too .
they have ideals too .
they , too , have aspirations .
why is that ?
what is the issue ?
what is this concern ?
he was probably threatened .
that is the legacy .
and , of course , the market .
she was in tears .
they can be exempt .
who are the victims ?
that is the court .
the farmer admits it .
those are the facts .
i like him .
why is this so ?
i apologise .
that is the answer .
it is a question .
that is accepted .
we condemn violence .
that is required now .
he must use it .
what is the government doing ?
what are we debating ?
that is in order .
that is what is happening .
we went to look .
he is simply talking nonsense .
that is what is happening .
we will do that .
so inform us .
how many people must die ?
how many people must die ?
how many people must die ?
i can close them .
we have a transport policy .
we are dealing with that .
are there any objections ?
the technology is available .
what does the constitution say ?
there are other board members .
we shall see shortly .
this is very interesting .
he organises global conferences .
that is the arrangement .
i put both amendments .
are there any objections ?
i would so recommend .
i have a problem .
no , there are others .
disciplinary procedures against officials
improvement of financial controls
juveniles in overcrowded prisons
are there any objections ?
what is wrong with that ?
who said what ?
what did they say ?
let them be honest .
i have been directly affected .
that is a fact .
that is the reality .
that is the reality .
this is a disgrace !
we spoke about it .
that is the truth .
leave the country now !
more people are unemployed .
what do we have now ?
that is very clear .
why , then , are they concerned ?
it is very clear .
i am very concerned .
it is public knowledge .
this practice is unacceptable .
they must admit it .
they understand this dilemma .
that was a good job !
are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice ?
are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice ?
are there any objections ?
are there any objections ?
i have mentioned it .
that is how we know you .
when i have finished .
what is the truth ?
tell us quickly .
what is wrong with that ?
that we must accept .
it is a principle .
the principle is right .
very often the question is : what motivates these attacks ?
our hearts are heavy .
now he should speak .
he should be heard .
judgment in ceres regional court
were there any objections ?
let the voters know .
tell us why .
do we control the officials ?
they could advise me .
it is very simple .
what do they find out ?
why did that happen ?
it is a pleasure .
we will watch it .
that is entirely correct .
it is exactly the same .
i have an interest .
there are two levels .
so what do we have ?
we have been working together consistently .
we formed it .
that raises our suspicions .
you are being very personal .
that is the issue .
however , who was present ?
what are you hiding ?
violence of urban terrorism
i quote further :
what happened here ?
who is it then ?
he is a hero .
it is scaring people away .
all lives are precious .
we have a responsibility .
where does the fault lie ?
i shall come back to that .
we must stamp that out .
let me tell them .
they are absolutely right .
i confess that here .
the alternative is conflict .
let it be praised !
those are the facts .
why are they doing that ?
i evicted him .
may i proceed , sir ?
we had to force them .
we had to force them .
i shall say why .
he can reply to them .
mr m ozinsky ( ? ) : get it in writing !
he must withdraw it .
beware , you had better sit still .
unfortunately that is the case .
they voted against it .
the people out there .
what were we to do ?
you always say that .
because it is true .
is everybody happy here ?
that was my mistake .
importation of cheaper drugs
we will teach them .
it speaks against polarisation .
you must be careful .
like they always do .
those are the facts .
what has happened about that ?
their days are numbered .
his strategy was correct .
what happened there ?
where is your speech ?
where is your speech ?
where is your speech ?
come and read it here .
come and read it here .
come read it here .
come and read it here .
but , but , but , but .
what are you going to do ?
that is very sad .
what is the point ?
it was a beginning .
it has become worse .
we will do it for nothing .
this is so true .
let me explain this .
who paid them ?
we must move forward .
do you have it here ?
i have it here .
let us have a look at it .
the bus broke down .
he wanted to take everything .
i find it unacceptable .
she sits here comfortably .
devastating mountain fire at gordons bay
i can understand why that is so .
they will tell them .
say something about newlands .
what is your point ?
the time was therefore included .
there had to be relief .
where was he at that time ?
no , you are not !
no , you are not !
of those , we have plenty .
he is listening to me .
did they request that ?
say it for us .
now , is that racism ?
something must be done .
what do they want to do ?
no , listen to that !
they do not show it .
i could continue in the same vein .
what did he do ?
did he emphasise that ?
you have got your facts wrong .
make a nice speech !
i horsewhip no one .
no , i will not .
i know the truth .
yes , i know you !
what were you doing ?
no , he did not .
what is she doing ?
we are tired of that .
no it is not !
yes , we are afraid .
yes , we are afraid .
why are we afraid ?
it is a disgrace !
and doing something positive .
i am worried about that .
what are we saying by this ?
what are we talking about here ?
that is the point .
it does so continuously .
we want to use them .
open your eyes !
they have nothing .
but you know that !
is that excellent governance ?
it is much appreciated .
they are most welcome .
it should be million .
what is this department doing ?
what are the benefits ?
we need to be champions .
i am sorry about that .
i subscribe to cooperative governance .
i said then :
i thank them for that .
where were you at the time ?
where was i at the time ?
i have dealt with that .
put it in writing !
i hear the brickbats .
i heard him .
that is so true .
this i can understand .
oh , he is present .
we agree on that .
who is going to be trained ?
i have learnt a lot .
they look like us .
what about other countries ?
i picked that up .
i thank her for that .
what happened today ?
those figures are astounding .
we are going to do it .
that is indeed so .
who makes the decisions ?
that is common knowledge .
it is , of course , possible .
we have proportional representation .
well , tell us about it .
five minutes with him .
one form is retained .
fires in the western cape
i wish i could .
the minister of housing :
the following posts exist :
the minister of education :
transfers to cultural organisations
it is as follows :
no , you did not .
that has indeed been done .
consistent action is essential .
let me mention examples .
security guards at provincial parliament
it was very simple .
that was the situation .
no , it has not .
no , we do something .
he has kept his word .
what have we done ?
what did you do ?
it is all hearsay .
the advertisements are being written .
i thank them all .
we will support it .
the minister of education :
the minister of education :
it is a question .
that is their choice .
bonteheuwel : construction of police station
that is a request .
the minister of health :
i did this .
that is the question .
applications for social relief grants
who should be fired ?
protection of commuters on trains ;
what was the question ?
what have we done ?
the answer was , yes .
what measures have been put into place ?
what is this ?
that is a fact .
that is a certainty .
i am not blaming them .
the minister of health :
the minister of health :
i shall go and find out .
the minister of health :
the minister of health :
the minister of education :
the minister of education :
no , we did not .
what have we done ?
you kicked him out !
i thank him for that .
let me repeat that .
i move accordingly .
are there any objections ?
bill reported without amendment .
your leadership is poor .
that he has been able to do .
and not members of the western cape community ?
that they will learn .
but he did not .
what is the reason ?
that is very important .
the show will go on .
he should take care .
let him work it out .
but that is wrong .
that is totally unacceptable .
types of rates for municipalities
what is the figure ?
the minister of education :
or any other discussion ?
we are very concerned .
it is the officials .
remember , democracy has a price tag .
it is about economic confidence .
the document is in circulation .
i am very unhappy about that .
he is not here .
it is not going to help .
i gave that undertaking .
i hate that type of thing .
i will now report progress .
war is an expensive exercise .
are those my own words ?
this is a cold fact .
they should please adhere to this .
the basics continue .
there is no doubt about that .
we wish him well .
he has done wonders .
you sit on the board .
that is a major problem .
it is a serious problem .
in the interim the commission is dysfunctional .
his department is also affected .
we all still remember that .
we give them money .
he took one programme .
and we want to change this .
i myself have elderly parents .
mr c m dugmore ( ? ) : who started the fires ?
we are not saying that .
i hope they are listening now .
my motive is also honourable .
let me proceed with my motion :
i am staying with my speech .
oh , is that the one ?
the other half is there .
our youth are our future .
they managed the problem .
how much time do i have left ?
this leads to continuous conflict .
i am very grateful for that .
it is pointless .
there is no doubt about that .
there is no doubt about that .
let us care more .
i want to note a few .
i want to extend my cordial thanks to him .
i want to thank them sincerely .
it is a mammoth task .
doctors are trained by specialists .
the same problem , but two standards .
here is another problem .
tertiary hospitals are important places .
he lost consciousness .
they are malnourished as well .
we are merely well-managed .
what is he going to do with it ?
how is that going to be managed ?
how is it going to be managed ?
and we fought them !
let us take it further .
have we lost the plan ?
he quoted quite correctly .
i think that is important .
this is important to us .
i think she is right .
we see it all over .
i am almost there now !
it is a major challenge .
we are going to take that further .
look at how they abuse me !
there is another abie .
we shall have to look at that .
we give you a lot of work .
this is my last plea .
yes , the jews were there .
but it goes much further .
i know some of them .
everything is in order .
i have the report here .
do not abdicate the responsibility .
that is with the state attorney .
has to be a sharp opposition .
who won the prize ?
i am coming to the prize .
i will refer to a few .
we must say this clearly .
this is an important component .
these members are doing good work .
first of all , they must advise me .
he should just be patient .
that is where transformation comes in .
i have mentioned this before .
all of this deals with valuations .
now , however , they are quiet .
they are as silent as the grave .
they carry on about transformation .
he mentioned the code of conduct .
i am putting my plea .
and you are doing it badly .
you are presumably talking about cape town .
now you are taking a chance .
shame on you !
what did you do about it ?
i supported that report .
they came from bonteheuwel .
it is a little disturbing .
no , it is a fact .
that is not true .
that is not true .
however , it needs to be done .
why did he do that ?
we agree absolutely .
notice is taken of that .
the first is transformation .
it is very much the same concept .
it is about good development .
i am going to talk about transformation .
it is a sensitive matter .
sorry , yes , only the chairperson .
i want to stress something here .
it was nine in the morning !
is that late for you ?
i have had that confirmed .
i would like to challenge him .
i may stay there overnight .
i am not perfect .
i have said my piece .
i will give one undertaking .
i now turn to cultural affairs .
that is my serious concern .
there was no answer .
we shall manage the environment .
we have no work .
where do we find ourselves today ?
they may have been funded more .
let us apply our minds to it .
we cannot lose anything .
we might just win .
i wish to thank her for this .
that is my personal opinion .
her concerns were covered by that .
she can rest assured of that .
you are the chief whip , king !
let us say this .
that is not true !
that is not true .
i just wanted to rectify that .
we need to look at alternatives .
the election is at hand .
i thank him sincerely for that .
it is just as long as i have it .
i should greatly appreciate that .
this is the black working class .
after that he receives an order .
that is not spelt out .
let me give an example .
i want to mention an example .
i wish to mention an example .
this influences everyone 's lives .
the inhabitants are extremely frustrated .
but who is doing the construction work ?
he should listen to me .
there is another issue .
this tender replaced it .
we had no alternative .
we do not build police stations .
oh man , you know nothing .
then speak , so that we can hear .
i have a small tank .
that is a different place .
this is the correct information .
let me mention an example .
can the third world compete ?
i report on progress .
he was not against it .
i think that is critical .
how many financial institutions have been created ?
those are all second homes .
we need to show our commitment .
it is not acceptable .
we need to debate this issue .
we are proud of him .
the objectives have been clearly spelt out .
indeed , we are of africa .
what is the effect of this ?
the point is well made .
we will certainly do so .
i certainly thank him for that .
one has a choice .
that is not dishonest .
it has been enunciated several times .
] let us contrast two things .
the same applies in this case .
he must look at what is happening .
it is a provincial one .
let me mention an example .
it will have to be speeded up drastically .
agriculture reaches out to africa .
farmers are under severe pressure .
the national process is there .
women , too , get varying wages .
today she has five children .
however , the goods are excessively expensive .
his children are doing well academically .
why are you trying to undermine it ?
that is what we are saying .
yes , the objection is noted .
are there any other notices ?
and we want to change this .
i myself have elderly parents .
my motive is also honourable .
they did a grand job .
of course , the answer is , no .
i think not !
tough measures must be taken .
it is an interim measure .
that is untrue .
he was the cause of this .
he should go back a bit .
i shall briefly discuss it .
it does not work like that .
what is wrong with them ?
why is that the case ?
i like his contribution .
and those regions .
i agree wholeheartedly with that .
another person was killed .
these are only a few .
we shall cause it to grow .
the future is our future .
they need the money .
that is my personal opinion .
it is an essential problem .
those are two areas .
i want to congratulate him on that .
those have become empty words .
do not come up with that now .
no , justice wears dark glasses !
i do a great many things .
let us leave it at that .
they call the police racist .
i have the correspondence here .
standing committee on public accounts :
who incurred that expense ?
thank you for the english lesson .
the call was for volunteers .
no hitches and glitches !
those issues are quite clear .
why did people have to be paid ?
that was to be their compensation .
it was in one day .
we will help you later .
there was no mismanagement .
look at what they asked for .
in the western cape had said .
this is your first question .
this has not happened .
that is not going to happen .
however , we must proceed with this .
he now answers those questions .
that is what i am saying .
it is the second question .
that is where this comes from .
i expect that he did .
he will give the details .
does it not make sense ?
we want to know from you .
can you answer the question ?
give me the date .
give me the date .
what nonsense is this ?
i have made a ruling .
that is a real crisis .
she asked three questions .
you voted for it now .
it is not about that .
what does one call them ?
well , i am clear about it .
can we rest with that ?
there are no objections .
who is the third one ?
i will abide it .
they were from the department .
so they can apply your minds to that .
potentially it is an opportunity .
our province is fundamentally unequal .
let us look at housing .
our community is crying out for justice .
is this leadership in fact being demonstrated ?
yes , tourists have to be protected .
our people are appealing for help .
we are now seeing specialised attorneys .
i thank them sincerely for that .
we will lay a charge .
they are always quiet on this .
our policy is quite clear .
there is none .
i want to issue a warning .
that is what it is .
they can go to school .
she is addressing the workers !
i work on behalf of law-abiding citizens .
but the provincial government has .
he will see it there .
unfortunately , the answer is no .
it makes it even worse .
how much did you pay him ?
even that is out of order .
that is a good point .
it seems contradictory .
i am in agreement with him .
problems with farms in western cape
what are you trying to say now ?
you hear what i am saying .
businesses also need to be protected .
the coalition government is doing nothing .
what do we want to achieve at the end of the day ?
what will i be getting out of this ?
who is to blame for that ?
that is not true !
that is not true !
we discussed the matter .
it is a statement of fact .
it is perfectly in order .
i could close them now .
it was two days later !
i am an honest member of parliament .
you must take the decision .
i shall take the decision .
you must take the decision .
my official is sitting over there .
i have delivered on my promises .
they mean absolutely nothing at all .
i did not know .
it is an outstanding policy .
i , too , referred to them .
that has been denied .
that is mind-blowing and unbelievable .
what will we do then ?
there is no clarity .
it does not make sense .
the answer is very simple .
i shall come back to that later .
i shall get to that in a moment .
he is a professional .
is that how it is read ?
bill reported with an amendment .
the bill makes provision for that .
that is the only reason .
sir , what is wrong with this ?
they should not get excited .
we had two proposals .
what good could come of that ?
they do not want to hear .
i am really polite , am i not ?
this causes serious questions to arise .
it is not justified .
let me give an example .
that is what you say .
a temporary concept of independence .
why do they not do it ?
that is what they are saying .
we have to make it work .
what are they trying to do here ?
that is very clear here .
he has been released from custody !
that is important to us .
i will come back to that later .
this is a good idea .
that is what we are coming to .
there is no doubt about that .
there is no doubt about that .
how do we overcome that ?
my department is not running it .
is it happening ?
these are concrete issues .
why are we getting the complaints ?
it is a difficult problem .
they contributed nothing .
i probably listened wrong .
which people owe worcester ?
we all have to accept that .
you support the national bill .
no one can dispute that .
that is exactly the same thing .
that is the important point .
that makes it very simple .
who must pay the tax ?
attacks on farmers in province
i ask that we rise .
are those deep-lying causes bridgeable ?
we must stop seeking excuses .
we must not accuse farmers .
i move without notice :
we therefore support the amendment .
he had his chance .
they wrote to me .
i apologise , sir .
when did his family enter into it ?
that is the very point .
do not fall off .
standing committee on public accounts :
every time something happens .
ask the national minister .
after all , his standpoint is well-known .
more bombs mean less work .
more bombs mean greater poverty .
i condemn racists and racism .
we can ignore their excuses .
we fired you as well .
look at the other provinces !
we acted against her !
that debate must be turned on its head .
i have not changed .
i shall come back to that .
i have many black friends .
these include , inter alia :
funds that have become available
however , the most significant amounts are :
that is the first component .
that is untrue !
that is what we are asking .
that is not true !
that is not true !
we did it long ago .
that is not true .
organised labour and organised agriculture .
he is going to do it again .
that is not true !
that is not true .
that is not true .
to whom does the land belong ?
i have his photograph here .
i can show the results .
that is not true .
but we are busy with that .
sir , could i be protected ?
that is how i feel .
i shall keep to that .
you must appear before me .
i withdraw the remark .
yes , that was entirely withdrawn .
so he must withdraw it .
that is a fundamental flaw .
no. what is his name ?
that , i believe , is democracy .
we fixed up their mess !
i move without notice :
i move without notice :
i will never keep quiet .
is this the best province ?
culture is more important than that .
it does not sound right .
that is a true responsibility .
there is no balance .
nothing positive is mentioned .
there we have strong differences .
what infrastructure is it building ?
it is a dropping percentage .
take the western cape as an example .
yes , many blacks stayed away .
they had their chance .
let us ask him again .
look at today 's newspapers .
they should enjoy their time .
i will tell you about that .
could only start telling the truth !
his remark was extremely reprehensible .
why are you not reading it ?
come and read your speech here .
let me congratulate him on that .
we are talking about the council .
we do not recognise any racists .
when will this happen , sir ?
yes , that is as it should be .
this is , of course , absolutely true .
is this a safe province ?
i wonder what happened .
what does it matter ?
they are as silent as the grave .
no , he is too young .
he is too young , of course !
i have worked through these statistics .
they should be ashamed of themselves .
it is going to be a challenge .
that i have to say without hesitation .
it did not work .
we have said little about them .
money spent by provincial government
why protect them against themselves ?
let me give an example .
she may have forgotten it .
we need to develop those relationships .
perhaps we should go into this .
now what are you trying to say ?
our youth are in a bad way .
the fourth pillar is education .
he is not here .
how can we forget that ?
you must come to me .
we should reach out .
i hope not .
we must do something about it .
that is what happened .
where have they shown that ?
that did not happen .
no one did so .
of course they will do it .
why do they have a problem ?
the process can be tested .
how long must we wait ?
how much can we take ?
others misled the house .
what are the real issues ?
then i confronted him .
this is my shop .
that is exactly the point .
you should go there too .
that is in general terms .
where is all this money ?
she was not there .
is that not true ?
we also supported it !
let us leave it at that .
that is the amazing thing .
let us talk about resources .
let us leave it at that .
let me give an example .
she will have to withdraw that .
i withdraw that , sir .
that is not true .
do not tell us stories .
it is substantial and it is deadly .
they say that racism does not exist .
we just talk about it here .
the coloured workers are worried .
all this , while rome is burning !
what did you do about it ?
what happened last week ?
now it is seven months later .
that was in jest .
he will have his chance .
does it mean that ?
i can promise him that .
why does he not ask him ?
he must read that booklet .
what is the history of that ?
why is he sitting over there ?
i will repeat the paragraph .
the house will now adjourn .
they are not asking for money .
how can we do it ?
what is the effect of it ?
we need to get a hold of that situation .
we need to be pioneering .
it is not going to stop .
how long must we wait ?
let me mention two examples .
everything was wrong under apartheid .
i can only be honest .
let us understand one thing .
what is the alternative then ?
that is what is necessary .
they keep harping on the same old string .
they harp on the same old string .
she should do her job .
we shall have to look at this .
this should be looked into .
that does sound reasonable to us .
that is not on .
to being a family that works .
i will continue to raise it .
why do not you ?
she is speaking to the television cameras .
they must do their homework .
it concerns gossip .
let us just be honest .
now i want to say this .
what more could i say ?
what more could i say ?
i speak it reasonably well .
theft of baby by caesarean section
these were not discussed .
the second aspect is translations .
let me put it this way .
we can continue talking about it .
we have a new dispensation .
the first principle is consultation .
the next principle is information .
tell us , please tell us .
they are simply being supported financially .
there are no administrative problems .
let me ask that question .
i shall reply as follows :
the minister of local government :
the minister of local government :
the report is here today .
the minister of local government :
that is a significant improvement .
the answer is as follows :
what is the internal process ?
the answer is as follows :
that is a different question .
to the premier without notice :
it was a giant success .
i am just testing your memory .
so why ask the question ?
let us take a look at this .
the answer reads as follows :
that is normal for you !
[ interjections . ]
i am the responsible minister .
to the premier without notice :
this did not happen .
what will this province do ?
what is the provincial government doing ?
he has kept his word .
they are busy with that at the moment .
we see it every day .
they will remain in place .
where did she say that ?
we can play games here .
that is no secret .
let us consider this background .
that is what is lacking here .
all those promises were made .
it is a national crisis .
he must put a question .
the minister of social services :
the leader of the house :
to the premier without notice :
i should like to rectify something .
the board appointed him .
the initiative can be taken .
when are we getting the regulations ?
when are we getting the regulations ?
could i repeat the question ?
the answer reads as follows :
to the premier without notice :
let me answer the question .
however , this is a cabinet decision .
correctional services : prisoners recently released
to the premier without notice :
i asked how much money ?
we have spent some money .
amalungu : asiva ! [ we cannot hear !
it was on the go .
and is he working there ?
just bear with me for a moment .
this is a significant achievement .
let me give an example .
is this transparent , open government ?
you did make it conditional .
i feel sorry for them .
the question is about intent .
i have the affidavits .
i can say it outside .
i do not make allegations .
can their pocket bear it ?
can their party bear it ?
the people will judge them .
however , that is par for the course .
they should ask the police .
however , we must be fair .
macassar has become a dumping ground .
repairs come under two allocations .
it is not necessary .
the minister of local government :
that is his first wedding .
he should clear up that question .
what are his plans around it ?
is there a plan for this ?
yes , she is quite able .
to the premier without notice :
they met again this morning .
it is the old officials .
public finance management act
let us take one step further .
this is a very serious matter .
many members read their speeches .
he spoke glibly about it .
they cannot do that .
he just went ahead and sacked his mayor .
of course , what is wrong with you ?
the department has thought of everything .
i am behind what he said .
we are not an island .
each and every one of them .
but there is no evidence .
i am not red in the face .
you have not learnt , mark !
which one are we going to bring about first ?
how does all this affect the western cape ?
that war never developed .
no , leave the crayfish for now .
nor is it propaganda .
who is being included in this project ?
in fact , it is her birthday today .
our future lies in our youth .
where will it be this weekend ?
i was waiting for your protection .
we have known each other for many years .
he will have our support in that .
they fall under two disciplinary codes .
they will bring about the stabilisation .
this is indeed a positive initiative .
i have also visited other schools .
the community also has to provide something .
they need to show their keenness as well .
the sign indicates a translation .
we certainly have the potential !
i refer now to our international relations .
let me mention a few examples :
it was truly outstanding investigative journalism .
i am still learning from them .
sir , i now turn to road safety .
this system also creates job opportunities .
sir , i now turn to the influx .
we will start with that next week .
there are even a few communists .
we are here to work .
this year brings another election .
have those grapes not been doctored ?
i wish to thank the department for that .
so she often displays this understanding .
in some countries this has been dramatic .
how does one analyse good results ?
i agree entirely with him .
i thank him for this contribution .
i will , however , certainly take a look at it .
the sign indicates a translation .
we shall strongly encourage these initiatives .
the parents out there are concerned .
he will be buried this week .
he said that again today .
what earth-shattering difference are we going to see ?
he cannot touch that .
i think that they deserve them .
i think it must be corrected .
i think our hospitals are better .
this we want to transform .
we will get back to clanwilliam later on .
i would like to mention two facilities .
this took place in january this year .
i should like to give a little background .
the local authority deals with the registration .
that is a very important advantage .
it is a very serious problem .
is that process happening ?
i now give him the opportunity to do so .
the national act is now there .
no one should feel threatened .
they rented from the jew .
i am not a jew .
his surname says he is one !
these people live in informal settlements .
the western cape is proud of him .
i must give him that .
so they had to change the law .
we are rapidly heading in that direction .
let us talk about that now , finally .
that is where the mistake comes in .
we congratulate them again .
such as the minister of the police !
we did , in fact , comment on it .
they are , again , politically constituted .
i will come to the composition in a moment .
the demarcation board is also involved in this .
we want to institute certain measures in this regard .
i think that that is very important .
what about the other ministers there ?
they keep on coming back for more .
next time everything must be in place .
what a funny day it is !
let us look at the legislation .
i am not repeating his speech .
sorry , sorry , sorry ; it is off .
i am not talking about cape town .
it is just not going to happen .
that is what we are experiencing at the moment .
it is well oiled and efficient .
nationally there has also been a reduction .
this is a very high percentage .
that is where the dissension comes in .
because they realise that they have to cooperate .
whom does the dp represent ?
i had the legislation ready .
one must , after all , be responsible .
that is only the first delay .
that is where it stopped .
why am i doing this in detail ?
there are countless such people .
the universities pump them out .
we could not understand it .
how far have we come with this ?
what is the name again ?
these two run hand in hand .
i want to make two points here .
the first one is this .
that should be taken into consideration .
that is when it becomes controversial .
i wish to make that absolutely clear .
we cannot carry on with this .
will you kindly take your seat ?
they have exactly the same problem .
let me mention a few examples .
it should rather be the other way round .
the question is still relevant today .
make a plea for their needs for a change !
the motion was not accepted .
let us give it a chance .
i would like to thank him very much .
i agree totally about macassar .
no , not three months later .
the first case was in november .
it is far from enough .
did you support funding it ?
there is a point of order .
however , there are a few amendments .
bill read a second time .
bill read a third time .
bill read a second time .
bill read a third time .
i move the first reading .
bill read a first time .
i now come to public transport .
i am not going to refer to that .
i am not going to repeat that .
for that we need a million motor mechanics .
this would include economic emancipation in particular .
the sooner this happens , the better .
the school had obtained donations for them .
why was the original tender withdrawn ?
that is exactly what we are doing .
i do not have many problems .
therefore this is not duplication .
he is again not here .
a terrible accident is going to happen here .
which road gets top priority ?
that is all i ask .
it is a very uncomfortable road .
at the taxpayers ' expense .
i think that is very important .
no , that is not true .
i thank her for her contribution .
did the minister write to her then ?
moneys owed to calitzdorp municipality
we will first hear the amendment .
why has it taken so long ?
this is an extremely exciting project .
the constitutional court blocked it .
and join in the debate .
that is how i serve him .
they had the same vision , all along the same lines .
it has to be at the cutting edge .
this is absolutely critical .
they are playing an important part there .
that communication is critical .
i think this needs to be followed up .
is the problem not here ?
well , it is fading from the red !
everybody else has dealt with that , i think .
i missed that particular hearing .
in any case , congratulations .
we shall try to deal with the problems .
in that way we shall make progress .
we cannot do that .
let us look at this brochure .
is that because they are black ?
that is totally dishonest .
i have received virtually none .
a vast number of people worked on that .
oh no , are you fighting back again ?
i move the second reading .
bill read a second time .
bill read a third time .
agriculture reaches out to other countries .
agriculture reaches out to research .
i think it is very important .
tension has crept into those relations .
the rural foundation has done a great deal of upliftment work .
we have to find a balance somewhere .
of course , we must motivate this further .
and feeding them with false information .
we must be able to hear the speaker .
let us just maintain that level .
some of our schools are to be closed .
the house is in such a bad condition .
they could never simply retire .
nick is married with four children .
life has been good to him .
we are now voting on the bill .
yes , but the objection is noted .
i would now like to complete this .
it is really a query .
it is not an objection .
is it an objection or not ?
i move the third reading .
bill read a third time .
the sign indicates a translation .
i simply want to move an amendment .
please put it to the house .
i then have to put the motion .
western cape declared cleanest province after investigations
we certainly have the potential !
i refer now to our international relations .
let me mention a few examples :
i am still learning from them .
sir , i now turn to road safety .
this system also creates job opportunities .
sir , i now turn to the influx .
there are even a few communists .
we are here to work .
this year brings another election .
it will deal with certain issues that are important .
he feared for his life .
violence is not a solution .
that is what she has been part of .
you voted for the constitution .
however , that is in the act .
we have a strange set-up here .
how does their democracy work , then ?
let us go a little further .
he knows what his contribution was .
bill read a second time .
bill read a third time .
our women and children are being mowed down .
that is not really surprising .
the responsible minister has a problem .
after all , crime there is an everyday matter .
the cape flats needs peace .
can the same be said of gangsters ?
yet , they are assured of bail .
it is of course not in order .
the week before last i was there again .
many people have to sacrifice their jobs .
that will not help us .
we need to invest in our children .
you have already done so .
giving drugs to gangsters !
and without any problem went there .
this has made us exceptionally vulnerable .
any society in transition becomes vulnerable .
we gave it to you .
but let us leave it at that .
they achieved a great deal of success .
they will be very good constables .
i did not intervene in the slightest .
you asked for an inquiry .
that is definitely their secondary role .
there is nothing wrong with that .
standing committee on economic development : members
let me hear from the house .
the call was for national service .
the other provinces volunteered .
why would it not agree ?
what happened in other provinces ?
that we shall never ever know .
they never read it .
perhaps he should go back to them .
he used what suited him .
read the letter to us .
they must learn the finer footwork .
mr speaker , firstly , let us think back ; where did the problem arise originally ?
i think the question is unfair .
my earlier question then falls away .
i would like to give a ruling .
i was not responsible at that time .
this is an unusual situation .
i must look at the results .
it is not a question .
i am very bad with numbers !
there are very many officials .
that , sir , is the real scandal .
i was not there at the time .
no , not across the floor .
i would like to put the schedule .
that is a point of information .
it is very concerning to us .
did they apply it in terms of post level ?
there are people who do it .
that is as far as it goes .
at all times volunteers get paid .
has he been given any dates ?
that is all it is .
these indeed are imposing developments .
so , of course this is so .
politicians have to confront the reality .
i should like to add my good wishes .
we witnessed that in his whole speech .
how many adverts did he pay for ?
i thank them wholeheartedly .
i have visited the cape flats .
i have also been to the rural areas .
we need a comprehensive strategy .
my door is open to everyone .
i have concerns regarding this portfolio .
no , we must be serious now .
what a formidable and dedicated public service !
i will mention four reasons why .
it is because of apartheid .
we are here in this province .
let us work it out here .
we cannot do that .
we cannot do that .
probably there will be many people .
i am not defending poor payment .
we are all in the same boat .
it is not a dead horse .
he goes on to say :
it was not a farmer .
the house agreed to the motion .
that is not just mere exploitation .
these people operate in the agricultural sector .
my colleague will say more about that .
i want to speak on two issues .
this was my way of thinking .
why did you sign this report ?
bill read a second time .
i do not have the figure .
i shall reply in full on that tomorrow .
i will be looking into those issues .
bill read a third time .
is that part of the motion ?
this cannot be allowed .
i am expressing this very broadly now .
i put it to him unconditionally .
i have made no threat .
there is no doubt about that .
secondly , it is about permits .
this is a political issue .
that is what we need to find .
we are worried about the subsidy .
what is she doing about her priorities ?
it is plagued by crime at the moment .
it reads , and i quote :
as far as i am concerned , it has been finalised .
we also have to follow a process .
how many people must die until then ?
tell me , how many people must die ?
she moved it without notice .
that really is the next stage .
there have been discussions all along .
they are the ministers of tourism .
it is a completely new animal .
and we are taking those risks , by the way .
i have here a ministerial handbook .
we respect it on both sides .
they are well ahead of the ten point plan .
it does not disqualify him .
i have every confidence in them .
that is the integrity of directors .
the facts are very simply these .
they are going to combine in november .
bill read a second time .
it applies to us .
we will get all the facts .
we agreed to the amendment .
i am now going to give my ruling .
does the deletion still hold ?
bill read a third time .
the committee therefore wishes to recommend that -
can we just have clarity on that ?
we are giving people a choice .
he shares what he wants to share .
they should not look for enemies .
he is making a habit of it .
we make no apology for doing so .
productivity is the cornerstone of democracy .
please , that is the important point .
we therefore did not take fright .
no , it is not stated there .
bill read a second time .
bill read a third time .
sir , this give rise to serious questions .
however , i wish to make two remarks .
with respect , i would like to finish .
it is simply not possible .
that is direct manipulation and intervention .
there is nothing wrong with that .
i do not condone it .
my colleagues know what i am talking about .
we were part of those discussions .
you joined us , remember !
and they will never be .
they must make their choice today .
we cannot go on like this .
he went on to say :
let us put the choice differently .
we have no other home .
we raised our voices .
we raised our voices !
i listened to the debate .
what is your message to brown people ?
but that is not true !
in some circumstances she is right .
unnecessary discrimination did take place .
i say today that that is wrong .
we have to move this matter forward .
we did not see them .
is that not concrete commitment ?
is the one in the western cape .
yes , because bester is always right .
the sign indicates a translation .
we have a point of order .
bill read a first time .
" he knows it is perfectly right .
we need a transparent rating system .
that is the one important point .
we could perhaps try to rectify these .
that is simply untrue .
these are divided into various categories .
one minute of silence was observed .
they were murdered two weekends ago .
there was no cause for it .
we condemn these attacks in the strongest terms .
our actions attest to that .
we must not accuse the attitude .
let us stop seeking excuses .
the minister of finance and development planning :
the motion was moved without notice .
we must try to maintain objectivity .
bill read a third time .
i fully endorse these amendments .
bill read a second time .
the report makes very interesting reading .
however , this is not true .
what happened to the process ?
the media reports on corruption daily .
let me give another example .
it reads , and i quote :
and so on and so on .
however , what has happened here today ?
i will wait for the legal advice .
there is a specific time for that .
that is very clear to us .
however , it is far too narrow .
that is irrelevant .
it is no longer there .
why was it not declared ?
period now he was not .
the government came in on it .
it was three years before that .
none of these were declared .
you are actually on the edge .
why do i raise this issue ?
how did i deal with the matter ?
why are you fighting so hard for this ?
the minister of finance and development planning :
i therefore move without notice :
the minister is not intelligent .
some were sitting under the tree .
that is nine bombs too many .
yes , we can make a difference .
no , they are biased towards them .
this is the only way forward .
let us confront the real tiger .
that is not going to help at all .
these include the following aspects .
what does the experience of our people say ?
i went there and took part .
that is not a quote .
they can take us to lawyers .
this is because we deplore racism .
are africans a threat to coloureds ?
the motion fills me with repugnance .
no , why do you want to withdraw it ?
i find this regrettable and unnecessary .
what do we seek in the agricultural industry ?
let me mention a few examples .
no , one must be consistent .
it does not belong to me .
no , do not say that .
crime abounds in our society .
let us look at the statistics .
i have noted that this sometimes happens .
it seems like a year ago .
because you have to justify your comments .
the next heading is financial discipline .
where are the jobs for all ?
it is noble and very much needed .
it does not rob the rich .
is it supported by black business ?
we would love to read it .
there is no sustainable development .
be careful here in the western cape !
i do not get involved in that .
you should be involved internationally .
i believe that to be important .
the writing is on the wall .
he spoke of his jacket .
first read it ! first read it !
no , people do not have houses .
they go on to say :
when is he going to take that step ?
but you have no plan .
long may they be in opposition !
and we will talk about sport .
they do not have to pay .
one can start questioning this .
ask him where he was .
the bus did not break down .
he preaches in the area .
the voters have gone beyond that stage .
they know that it happened .
that is what he said .
yes , i am going to make a point .
they were equally stunned and appalled .
it reads , and i quote :
let me read her response .
that is what we need to do .
i feel it with them .
i was just as deeply disappointed .
they did not have the powers .
that is the question being asked out there .
he regularly gets into the news .
she said , and i quote :
she went on to say :
let me continue with the quotation :
you are running scared , are you ?
such a request has not come .
just sit down and shut up !
give the police that power .
give the province that authority .
it is strange how things change .
they are hiding what we know .
it had all the resources .
the expanding squatter camps pose major problems .
they do not have a mandate .
i must first give a ruling .
the eyes of the voters have opened .
is it permitted in the house ?
that is how he spoke .
they missed their chance .
they did not use it .
then we do not care .
this is not the same group .
he disappeared at twelve o ' clock that night .
what does he think of that person ?
it is being repeated at this point .
that is not true at all .
only they may take the fingerprints .
only they may issue the identity documents .
only they may receive the applications .
we must look at this again seriously .
what happened over the weekend ?
five cabinet ministers misled the house .
i object most strongly to this .
i quote from die burger :
they have done all those things .
you should have done something before .
they have never felt apartheid !
so what did you do about it ?
that indicates a respect of freedom of religion .
is that happening ?
it is now eight months down the line .
are they aware of those issues ?
we all need to rectify the situation .
they were part of those things .
not a word of criticism !
we appreciate this and are planning accordingly .
this warrants some explanation .
let us make it a reality .
we must get smart on crime .
let us look at little further .
it was not that serious .
he did not say anything about it .
what delivery was he referring to ?
we cannot hear one another .
the people voted for us .
that is not the majority .
what about the history of apartheid ?
the sign indicates a translation .
that i believe is quite an achievement .
bill read a first time .
today we are seeing the effects of that .
yes , i have just praised it .
what is the policy of education ?
let me give another example .
thanks for at least admitting it .
there is no doubt about that .
we do not have the funds .
he should not be in a hurry .
this programme received a conditional grant .
they should not feel intimidated .
let me mention another example .
i hope he can appreciate it .
that is where i was at the time .
i thank him for his support .
that is what i am able to do .
i now move the second reading .
bill read a second time .
let me give a few examples .
let us look at the future .
one has to define it more deeply .
the consultant would have to be responsible .
we must be honest with one another .
we also have the following concern .
i congratulate the office on that .
that is not our business .
my own view is this .
that is a very great problem .
how much do you think it is going to cost ?
it is interesting , not clever !
you are guessing and you are misleading the house .
that assurance was given to me .
yes , we have to do something about it .
this is my office 's work .
they must stop wailing and complaining .
we stated that this morning .
she repeated it again this morning .
some people must do their homework .
we have to come up with our own .
this whole attack lies very deep .
it lies far deeper than that .
i thank her for her speech .
they have not accepted it .
must i say it in afrikaans ?
no , i understand it reasonably well .
they have done a very neat job .
let us bring the press here .
the officials have done a good job .
that element must be part of it .
this is just not acceptable .
i would like to mention certain points .
it will not stop .
these are the amounts as allocated .
there is no political interference .
it is being used very fruitfully .
the acting minister of social services :
the case is still under investigation .
the acting minister of social services :
the minister of finance and development planning :
the minister of finance and development planning :
the minister of transport and works :
the minister of finance and development planning :
the answer continues as follows :
in fact , it will be there tomorrow .
the minister of transport and works :
why has that not been done ?
this is what we ascertained .
the framework is available to us .
therefore there are lessons for us to learn from it .
i cannot understand it .
that figure will not come down .
it reads , and i quote :
i did not say that .
a number of others remain in custody .
i regarded them with suspicion .
that is what he has received .
no , sir !
that is why i was there .
i have made a ruling on that .
do they have access to those replies ?
therefore , the other questions fall away .
i need information placed before me .
that is not my function .
i think that answers his question .
i did not appoint them .
what sort of an answer is this ?
the national department is dealing with the complaints .
it is a combination of factors .
let us put the record straight .
you do not read the newspapers .
i do not read the newspapers !
i think that is very important .
it was not a march .
did he not know that ?
i want to answer the question honestly .
i do not need that .
it depends on the circumstances .
the sign indicates a translation .
i thank them for their enthusiasm .
again , my thanks to him .
he stood by his team .
i am a culprit here .
i think everybody has spoken about it .
i was not present unfortunately .
i think it was extremely constructive .
bill read a second time .
bill read a third time .
bill read a first time .
their branches are also collapsing .
how many people voted for you ?
are you not proud members of this community ?
you cannot lead it .
i gave him that chance .
we will deliver to the poor .
how much money is in his pocket ?
that is why they come here . [ interjections .
i will say it outside now .
it has become a blunt tool .
to me that is delinquency .
you do not have to wait .
would he support something like this ?
we cannot afford that .
he will not do so .
properties belonging to province
that was part of the question .
that is part of the problem .
which parties are you talking about now ?
however , that is a one-off case .
who is doing this deliberately in this administration ?
it is not about a tax .
it is about confidence in the province .
we need to start standing together .
we cannot focus on expenditure .
i think that is very worrying .
we must remember where we come from .
his colleagues cannot do that .
yes , but we had to sack her .
i do believe that it is important .
i think that was a great pity .
they had members on scof as well .
you will repeat that outside this house .
what have you done with those allegations ?
in short , he declared war on crime .
our hearts go out to their families .
you did not want that .
we cannot wait that long .
not go picking up crayfish .
nothing beats the bobby on the beat .
i wanted to know everything , day and date .
we are all pleased for her .
she is a young girl from bonteheuwel .
no , we are satisfied with the government .
we have supported the police .
these are two totally different concepts .
is only to confuse the people .
do not attack the constitution again .
we owe her a great deal of gratitude .
i wish her a rest richly deserved .
i think this ratio is unfair .
he is correct ; we can do this .
some concerns even had to dismiss extra workers .
i believe we must take even more stringent action .
that is what this provincial government is exercising .
the new century demands a new approach .
is there any objection to the motion ?
thirdly , students require adequate texts .
he said , and i quote :
sorry , i did not hear that ?
further facilities may be developed as required .
educational change is a very complex matter .
above all , change must be systemic .
he said , and i quote :
this is something that must be investigated .
the classrooms are in a bad condition .
yes , it is true that policy is a national affair .
however , i do believe in freedom of choice .
this will drastically cut patient waiting time .
we truly appreciate this level of cooperation .
i think he is an outstanding manager .
i think that was very important .
the lack of training causes expensive mistakes .
this stresses the ambulance services unnecessarily .
then there is also overtime and promotion .
we are not a rich province .
he said nothing about it today .
and he continues in the same vein .
he said exactly that again today .
i do not know what he means .
that is what we are trying to put right now .
that will probably make a huge difference .
it is a major concern .
at least then they listen to me .
it is possible to do that .
i have mentioned this in scof as well .
people sometimes call it a controversial issue .
i believe that it is very successful .
they will be taken off the list .
i always use a loaf of bread as an example .
this department has many other growing burdens .
she said the same things in february this year .
she could not do that either .
they cannot just be ignored .
are there any objections to the motion ?
unfortunately , unemployment and economic hardship are rife .
there are thousands who suffer that fate .
we know the history of district six .
i was not talking about our jews .
the jews are a large nation , after all .
you are talking about the national government again !
what were the findings of that inquiry ?
i shall not go into this now .
i do not have a problem with that .
yes , but take a look at the scoreboard .
they are not counted as houses .
i have nothing to give .
many municipalities took a very active part in it .
that was to the municipality of riversdale .
we know that the money has been utilised effectively .
we will have to look at this very carefully .
in that lies a great challenge for us .
it cannot simply be stopped .
i must immediately qualify this statement , however .
i think that is an important difference .
i thank in particular our staff .
and she knows that i can do it .
now they ask me again what act ?
we have a former minister there as well .
the problem lies with the national government .
at least one person appreciated his speech !
is that how he runs his departments ?
we have seen a wonderful show today .
he does not know what happened .
i know the family who were burnt to death .
correct , it goes directly to local governments .
this is why we are looking for plans .
it is not in place yet .
we have to be consistent and stay consistent .
standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling :
this is a motion moved without notice .
no , we cannot carry on like this .
there are six different sets of structural plans .
are you giving me the sack ?
it also states , and i quote :
it is true that comments were received .
perhaps those facts could just be reviewed .
this issue is of utmost importance .
however , it is not my decision .
personally i do not take offence .
i cannot find my notes .
it is not fair and reasonable . "
a warm word of welcome to them .
transformation of museums is therefore a high priority .
it is , indeed , a very serious issue .
this definitely needs to be encouraged and nurtured .
what a willing earth we have !
someone said , and i quote :
in terms of that section , and i quote :
here we have them funded .
that appears to be the cowardly way .
i did not say in december .
that is an acknowledgement of a mistake .
there was nothing in the newspapers .
it is once again a difficult question .
i do not have to answer that .
i ask you to be even-handed .
we ask that this exception be made .
now they are beginning to flinch and withdraw .
the people in bonteheuwel are waiting for him !
he is talking through his neck , as usual .
service delivery in black areas was extremely bad .
we certainly cannot carry on like this .
he wanted to play to the gallery .
promote the establishment of appropriate public transport systems ;
the budget is being divided into three categories .
to god alone all honour and thanks .
we wish him a blessed rest .
what has happened to that amount of money ?
what are we going to do as an alternative ?
it is against your party 's policy .
in this direction , from robertson to worcester .
unemployment and poverty remain enemy number one .
two questions immediately occur to me .
the elands bay community is having a very hard time of it .
these matters must now be finalised urgently .
the school then took the initiative .
what is the name of the company ?
who is going to benefit from this tender ?
i also want to know how many were women .
therefore we are looking at all these aspects .
the funds for maintenance are really meagre .
the office is good enough for me .
a few improvements will be made .
the staff of parliament are all accommodated .
we build and maintain hospitals and schools .
that is the work we do .
he also referred to national legislation .
we should rather support the national minister .
let us rather forget about those things .
it is our responsibility to see to that .
that is how the cake is sliced .
there are possibilities , and we are investigating them .
i spoke after her .
we have two schools with the same name .
i have not seen the advertisement .
i hope she is happy with it .
we simply have to restructure faster than that .
all the other provinces are coming to look at it .
it is not an adopted child .
that will be another couple of months yet .
the public out there and the property managers are waiting .
why can we not get involved ?
why would one want to register them then ?
we have had a good , healthy debate .
then one only has one choice .
i have dealt with that now and before .
it is the one i am referring to .
i gave him a reply in the house .
we hope it is a delightful lunch .
human rights may not be violated in that way .
what benefits have they really derived from that ?
people have to be paid in accordance with their value .
what is happening now in regard to the products overseas ?
she is the oldest of four children .
nick hopes to retire shortly .
his knowledge of agriculture amazes me .
it is true that there are inequalities between men and women .
i should like to invite her to the farm .
three minutes is allowed for the declaration .
no , we are not trying to undermine it .
would any other party like to speak to that ?
i have to note it as an objection .
i think we need clarity on this .
that is all that has to be recorded .
that is the point we are making .
that concludes the business of the house .
we cannot allow a discussion .
are there any objections to the motion ?
that concludes the business of the house .
i make this appeal in all sincerity .
some concerns even had to dismiss extra workers .
i believe we must take even more stringent action .
that is what this provincial government is exercising .
the new century demands a new approach .
i have called for notices of motion .
the bill is much broader than that .
indeed , no solution has been pursued .
these unruly , intimidating bully-boys must be stopped .
this is an absolute shame and disgrace !
however , he has done nothing about it .
he said , and i quote :
let us look at the background to it .
we have never had this before .
at least the leader is giving leadership here .
i have no problem with that .
however , it must be a valid objection .
that is by no means my intention .
something is happening here .
we shall have it take root .
we do not need lofty idealism .
there will not be any trials .
this is a fact of life .
they are assured of the best medicine .
that is what i do not agree with .
he is supposed to support me .
at present this is not the case .
that will not solve the problems .
something is very wrong in this province .
he speaks about things that were good .
but let us leave it at that .
they always have to accompany another policeman .
i think the chief whip has a point .
that is the tragedy at the moment .
they can carry on with those allegations .
standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling :
delays in pension and grant payouts
he knows exactly what progress has been made .
we are living in a very strange society .
it was a call to national service .
why did we not get volunteers ?
indeed , they did this with distinction .
he said , and i quote :
no one knows how many public servants were mobilised .
no one knows for what they were paid .
you do not have a speech .
they come here and make complaints .
however , they did not do that .
" would that have been a better decision ?
it was done openly throughout the province .
but why did you use that all ?
bill accordingly read a second time .
we want to know the details .
that is what we are dealing with now .
i would now like to give my ruling .
i would now like to put the schedules .
all the questions and answers are being recorded .
that is the ruling that i am making .
it could not have been different .
i cannot remember the date .
secondly , from what projects did this come ?
we heard how many people registered .
the people who get pensions are old people .
on what date did the saving occur ?
i will be receiving the full detail .
it is about authorisation of expenditure .
that was the extent of the discussion .
that is all they could afford .
they were not two different services .
i will answer it in a letter .
it seems from planning .
so yes , i have applied my mind specifically .
i want to put my last question now .
for the fillings of his posts ?
that is actually a point of order .
they cannot afford our silence .
all of us have been saying that for years .
the voters did not buy that .
what is the size of houses in mpumalanga ?
my first order of business was in khayelitsha .
that is how i see my task .
people are waiting for delivery ; nothing else .
for a long time gangs have been part of our existence .
the time for making promises is past .
we must get equal and fair service delivery .
i need only mention a few examples .
farm workers are the salt of the earth .
is this a good record of government ?
now i will return to my speech .
there is no smoke without fire .
this is money that they should be selling .
i could enumerate several other examples .
i ask myself : liberate from what ?
is that what they want to liberate us from ?
no one was chased away , they deserted .
sir , let me mention another example .
they are behaving as if it does not exist .
i said that it is noble-sounding .
so there are very many cheap drugs available .
and it is not only there .
surely he would have heard the news ?
the standing committees are going to be very busy .
we need a clear explanation of this .
we simply get a list of donations .
so there is some progress .
you are not very hands-on .
it is because there was a commitment .
no , it is a point of order .
so i could continue up to the present .
after that we may proceed with the debate .
the first issue is money and subsidies .
and it is not only that .
public transport must not be politicised .
perhaps that should have happened earlier .
what is being done by the provincial government ?
what are they trying to prove in the house ?
yet , we have been called to this debate .
he must make up his mind as to what he is actually talking about .
no , i cannot allow that .
no , i cannot allow it .
this country is being plagued by crime at the moment .
lives in khayelitsha and nyanga are cheap .
the authority of the state is being challenged .
you are not going to close them , piet .
i certainly did not hear that .
the criteria were set by this government .
it is not a provincial criterion .
we have to get nominations from the public .
why did you call this sitting , piet ?
except when he goes there for purposes of politicking .
at the moment they go in there .
each has two directors on the board of directors .
so they are indeed reliant upon one another .
competition domestically naturally also means competition internationally .
we will keep a close watch on that particular aspect .
this brings us major dividends for our province .
i think that is very good .
all of the directors there have disclosed their interests .
we will therefore move into committee now .
are there any objections to the amendments ?
in the original there were two agreements .
so you have lost all your credibility .
implementation of public finance management act
they should get their house in order .
he is scared of the municipal election results .
and a president who also does it .
they do not even have a future .
and we gave it to them .
those people have already promised one another posts .
why did i accede to a caucus ?
they may even delegate powers to municipalities .
no , we cannot go on like this .
where he gets that , i do not know .
i do not wish to discuss it further .
that the principle is the important point .
we know it and he knows it .
naturally no one is above criticism .
we have had enough of this interference .
i am not dancing on your graves .
hold your tongue and wait !
that is precisely what we are seeing here .
bad luck , they did not get him .
viljoen answered , and i quote :
they are going to take the people 's farms away .
they say that it is tantamount to terror .
so that we could fight these things .
we must say that clearly to one another .
that is the motion on the table .
is that the institution she works for ?
what are the realities for black businesses ?
this has been covered in the press as well .
it is a red herring .
they say that they are badly treated .
that is what is happening .
sir , let us go a little further .
those difficulties need to be put right up front .
sir , i thank you for the opportunity .
that completes proceedings for the day .
wishes to report as follows :
no , i cannot allow that .
and then i will give a ruling .
what happened in our first election ?
because his facts are not correct .
we need it sooner rather than later .
that is where our big problem lies .
i think that is the important point .
i think my colleague referred to this .
violence on farms does us all harm .
nevertheless he says that our farm workers are precious .
they are instilling hatred .
these , alone , are serious issues .
he also states , and i quote :
he goes on , and i quote :
that is the reality in that council .
what was the response of the community ?
let us take the mayor as an example .
let me raise another issue .
how can any one of them defend this ?
what did he as minister do about it ?
where was he when it happened ?
we investigate matters when something goes wrong .
these issues are all in the records .
i will make sure of my facts .
give us the times , the dates .
we have asked for good governance here .
do you need to go into politics again ?
standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling :
when is he going to have the culprits arrested ?
it is being said , and i quote :
he never said that .
his safety was jeopardised .
we must begin to realise those things now .
today we are still reaping the fruits of that .
that is the gravity of the matter .
all of us will be the losers .
tourism and investment will remain the losers .
growth and redistribution will be the losers .
let us not ride that tiger .
it says here , and i quote :
they have attempted to do that .
i worked there for many years .
tell me that that is representative !
racism may simply change colour .
to me that is what morality means .
we are one nation with one future .
in terms of the rules , the bill stands referred .
that is the appeal i am making .
i am coming to the rotten apples .
sir , i quote again :
that was done four years ago .
but that is not true !
he does not care about farm workers .
that is the situation we are experiencing .
you know it is not true .
it is not only white farmers .
i represent farmers that abide by the law .
the public prosecutor refused to prosecute him .
that man is not a farmer .
this is quite an important issue .
standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling :
wishes to report as follows :
wishes to report as follows :
there is no such point .
the two do not match .
i will return to this item later .
we are fighting corruption down to its roots .
that is certainly not the case .
we venerate the people that are sleeping eternally .
they are the real wealth creators .
the article states , and i quote :
the media in this country , it becomes front-page news in every international newspaper .
this is , of course , evident from the election results .
i believe that to be their duty .
in our province and arrest its advancement .
that is what happened to them .
i look forward to the next election results .
it was the colour of his jacket !
that this was discussed in their caucus .
no , i never said that .
wait a moment , you had your turn .
she wrote you a letter .
was that not good for nation-building ?
all your plans are lying in archives somewhere .
there is also a lot of dirt around them all the time .
that is close to our hearts .
we are trying to give the money .
we cannot correct the past .
he goes to that area every sunday .
the voters do not think about it any longer .
the voters want to live a decent life .
there is a lot he can learn .
that is a good example of cooperation .
i would have felt just as they do about it .
that is precisely what they did .
i appealed for cooperation .
i do not know if he can .
she then goes on to say :
on what basis does she make that judgment ?
i know how she did it .
she said , and i quote :
i would like to relate an interesting story .
that is the seriousness about petty division .
what on earth is going on ?
there is simply very little to report .
the people of the cape understand that .
no , we are not scared at all .
we led and fought that struggle .
no , we did not invite them .
that is exactly what he did !
today they walk the streets .
now the national minister of education is here .
i must hand her a bouquet .
in fact , he said that he had not .
i speak because i was affected as well .
we do not have a home now .
it is unfair to divide people .
they did not win the election .
he said , and i quote :
they tried to force a little confrontation .
that is cause for great concern .
let me mention one or two points .
i want to point out just one more case .
this is from a group of senior officials .
no one else will do the registration .
he can go and see what is happening there .
why does there have to be a coalition first ?
you have just misled the house .
let me simply say : what a disgrace !
i was helping them .
i was helping them .
they are shamed by those processes .
what have they delivered in terms of those programmes ?
we are not against registration .
what are they going to do with the addresses ?
everyone took part and he was elected .
however , i have some good news .
is that not an incredible thing ?
however , i did some research .
under me they get seven times more !
however , i have drawn my own conclusions .
she has no capacity .
she does not have the capacity .
she does not know what she is doing .
is that what they want to achieve ultimately ?
they do not allow themselves to be fooled by this .
that is not really the point .
really , very little has happened for farm workers .
they also contribute to the economy .
i am not taking a question now .
i said that two years ago .
that is the point i am making .
i question this because it concerns me .
i have given him one extra minute .
i shall return to these matters later .
i afford him that opportunity .
then there are some general remarks .
i would once again like to thank them .
that , of course , is nowhere near significant .
they are a cost to the province .
let me explain it to the house .
this means that there is no bureaucracy .
it will benefit all .
also this tax can be an immediate generational tax .
i apologise to my friend over there .
i would love to hear from them .
that has always been said .
that is the point that worries me .
i believe that that should be noted .
therefore i repeat that we need to work together .
i am going to take my first bite now .
this will include especially our rural communities .
her place should be nurtured , respected and cherished .
we have absolutely no objection to that .
is this the government 's new message ?
it seriously needs to be answered .
i should like to mention a simple example .
that is entrenched in the national constitution .
i now come to the real statistics .
staff management will now also be concerned with this .
how much is going to be spent on those training programmes ?
how does one reach out to them ?
i agree that there are constraints .
however , they really have no clear programme .
in education , what is happening around gender ?
the women must be part of that .
i see that his colleagues are joking about it .
we must shift family life in this province .
i think we are trying to reinvent the wheel .
our building is inaccessible to our disabled people .
he delivered a very good speech .
all they come up with is cheap criticism .
i was the chairperson of the meeting .
they should please go and read my speech .
she also made another point .
i can see that he is very happy .
we wish them everything of the best and welcome them .
shared authority is a monstrosity to us .
it is in this way that we can bring about continual improvement and refinement .
the rules will have to provide for that .
now there are no more excuses .
the coordinators work for the whole committee .
there must be some contradiction here .
they did not have equal access .
they signed documents to that effect .
we ask what they are going to be doing with it !
he should bring it to us tomorrow .
the minister of economic affairs and tourism :
results are unknown at this stage .
we will give you the name .
commission of enquiry : cape peninsula fires
why has it been tabled today ?
that , simply put , is the reason for it being so .
therefore it will not happen automatically .
i could very well have signed it .
that is misleading the house .
that was a case of deliberately misleading the house .
why are they so quiet on the matter ?
we will always assist in that manner .
the minister of economic affairs and tourism :
let me talk of what we are doing .
what is happening in africa ?
i think that that is a malicious generalisation .
i understand why he takes this attitude .
she said that in parliament .
they all worked very hard on this issue .
we have said so on a number of occasions .
all these people have always only talked .
the police has also done an investigation .
the minister of transport , sport and recreation :
i quote further from the same paragraph :
we will do it as soon as possible .
it is contrary to your ruling .
they are employed for the following services :
i cannot deal with hypothetical situations .
and spell my name properly the next time .
firstly i did not say that .
i asked questions and wrote letters .
there was a one-year delay .
that is the answer to the question .
i shall enquire through the administration .
town clerk of porterville : illegal trade in diamonds
the minister of local government and development planning :
disabled persons in the employ of provincial administration
some of the areas are :
however , i certainly would not condemn anybody at all .
in a few cases alterations were made .
the minister of local government and development planning :
an appeal was received on this matter .
if not , how many have left the system ?
that is what the province did .
so it does have a negative effect .
he knew we had to cut back .
we know what the arguments were during that time .
what is the value of the contract ?
is he working for the contractor or consultants ?
is he working there and what does it cost ?
opportunity must lie at the heart of sustainable development .
the funds have been rolled over for three years .
the one is an issue of a principle .
i hope my figure is relatively accurate .
they have not addressed the issues .
no , i do not have to sell anything .
i have said what i will do .
is this about egg on the face ?
i said then that we should try to work together .
that is the way we are going .
they are often made at public telephone booths .
what does a person pay in those terms ?
yes , we will be making policy on it .
sale of provincial assets : policy framework and criteria
the minister of economic affairs and tourism :
schools : closure and selling of moveable assets
other items were dealt with in the same way .
we have seen this in their actions .
i am allowed to gamble there , as a matter of interest .
if this ship sinks , we will all drown .
let us not bedevil it any longer .
they have not been consulted .
i have asked a question in this regard .
there is a lot of confusion about this question , though .
that is not a point of order .
we are not far from that point .
that is the expression which i used .
he came up with the figure of four .
he has dealt with him as well .
i will do so at the earliest opportunity .
the chairperson of committees took the chair .
i want to name some of these programmes .
the first aspect is aged abuse .
we have another problem in this country .
there are basics we need to get right .
what are the criteria for people to be nominated ?
we also congratulate the commissioner 's deputy .
he should be careful about what he says .
how can he condemn them in that fashion ?
no , i do not sit on the board .
no , we are doing exceptionally well at the moment .
this is a statistic we must change .
several programmes are launched in the communities every year .
i want to return to the topic of racism .
one should compare this to white areas .
their top dancers competed internationally last year .
our children are being meaningfully occupied and developed .
the newspapers do not say much about this either .
i think this is a good trade-off .
we are very closely involved in the presentation .
and we can be proud of these achievements !
we must do what all real winners do .
why do you not market your government better ?
our elderly people are among our greatest assets .
sir , i make this appeal in all sincerity .
i thank him for his dedication .
perhaps his example should be followed elsewhere .
enough blood has flowed on our roads .
there is another challenge on the horizon .
the chairperson of committees takes the chair .
i also pay tribute to all of them today .
this is not our definition of transformation .
this is only half my speech .
there is a great deal that can still be said .
this is important for the future of all of us .
that is not me speaking .
has the gap between schools narrowed ?
i do not know what the cause of that is .
this is another equally complex matter .
that is true , and we are proud of it .
lastly , there is the whole question of marketing .
this is a fine ideal to achieve .
there is also a high rate of vandalism .
i cannot speak for other provinces .
change is complex and it is often chaotic .
we looked at this issue in detail .
indeed , very often the contrary is the case .
maths and science are in an enormous crisis .
we will identify that effort and reward it .
the chairperson of committees took the chair .
i spoke to the contractor there this morning .
we thank him for his recognition and support .
mothers and children should be treated with dignity .
the letter continues , and i quote :
he left a widow and two daughters .
our good intentions are not good enough .
lentegeur hospital has suffered the most damage .
have we lost the intention ?
how many nurses could that be used to employ ?
unfortunately , there are also blockages in the system .
the expenditure is then submitted to the department .
but it is definitely not on paper .
in this respect a national strategy has been developed .
she just does not have the initiative .
she should play politics outside this house .
how are we going to be represented in that court case ?
that is something that we need to be able to do .
i have not sat in my office .
we will definitely have to take that into consideration .
the chairperson of committees took the chair .
the details of this initiative are still being finalised .
i hope to make an announcement in due course .
now , however , i am going to be a bit naughty .
the price was irresistible and they sold it off .
it was then given to another community .
they cannot have long drawn-out sentences .
but they are prepared to contribute .
on my insistence an internal inquiry was held .
in rand value it does not sound like very much .
there is , in the first instance , outdated legislation .
we know that this is one of the shortcomings .
this is another important aspect .
at this stage only two posts are filled .
they will be in operation from next week .
i think the negotiations are now going to be easier .
let us first look at the types of municipalities .
that is the first challenge to those structures .
together with that go the assets and liabilities .
yes , that also includes purchases .
today we are dealing with local government .
see how one has to struggle with them .
he mentioned the municipal services and levies .
now they ask me where is the act .
there is something else that has to be said .
and during that period he was the chairperson .
he must be careful about what he says .
are we really agencies of national government ?
there is no disaster fund anywhere .
i do not know what he wanted to prove .
i did not refer to tulbagh today .
a fire engine simply cannot get in there .
i also wish to thank them for their contributions .
i am very sorry to have to say this .
i do not have much comment about that .
the chairperson of committees took the chair .
today , seven months later , we are hearing the same story .
it is not about the skills , though .
i think the two go hand in hand .
i am certainly no empire-builder .
he was not at his best today .
that is the very reason for the delays .
i think he is treating the matter unfairly .
i do not believe that it is unconstitutional .
we are not going to leave it there , though .
this is a do or die situation .
the libraries form the cornerstone of our education .
that is not a point of order .
they have a whole number of other phrases for it .
we are prepared to apologise .
i think we have the right minister for that .
then they have a " maak van dose " project .
people cannot live under those conditions .
i would welcome any suggestions in this regard .
there was something else i wanted to point out .
the chairperson of committees took the chair .
i ask that this be agreed to .
that is a direct accusation in the house .
no , this has nothing to do with that .
now he is showing us who he really is .
he did not bring it to the fore .
the chairperson of committees took the chair .
we are committed to achieving this .
the industry itself has been generally supportive of this measure .
i now turn the provision of bus services .
this is a transfer from the national department .
this is not a very good approach .
that is what is so sad about the whole story .
however , the white paper and the budget are contradictory .
the people must be involved in the process .
i do not know where the regulations are .
we have not yet had feedback about them .
we in this province are serious about legislation .
they are not showing respect to the speaker .
however there is still a lack of discipline .
i think that we should just look at this again .
we should rather not just comment either .
we try to make healthy politics out of these things .
they said it was an impossible task .
it influences everyone who has a car .
this will result in more unemployment .
the popularity of these plates is growing daily .
our expert officials researched this matter scientifically .
that is what the school then did .
there should be a shift in mindset .
he will never know what black people go through .
it is a road with many structural deficiencies .
he also referred to transformation in works .
he is a little unhappy with my office .
offices are usually cleared with the relevant minister .
i will now reply to the question again .
he said that we should get it .
every department can do that on their own .
we must not make politics out of transport .
it cost them quite a few rands .
he should not play off roads against one another .
but at the taxpayers ' expense .
i want to thank him , his foreman and his workers .
no , i did not write to her .
the contents must only concern the motion .
i would like to dwell on that for a moment .
that illustrates what has happened in the world economy .
firstly , competition now is global rather than national .
this has resulted in unemployment and economic decline .
they are really doing well in several areas .
we look forward to seeing it .
i think one should give credit for that .
however , success brings its own challenges and responsibilities .
the more competition one has , the better .
it is something which i have mentioned previously .
that had to do with red tape in the planning division .
and that is the essence of what we are talking about .
the chairperson of committees took the chair .
we must act responsibly and we must not overreact .
it is difficult to understand the drop .
one can see that they are honourable people .
that is what that party called them .
stock theft has increased tenfold over the past five years .
throughout the world the market for white wine has slumped .
every day people are dismissed and businesses are closed .
there are indeed farmers who try hard .
she was in primary school for six years .
bokkie has , however , no other option .
apparently they fought together in the war .
he hopes to travel the world .
i hope that i do not mangle the english .
i think that it has been a long time since she was on a farm .
this is not an objection , is it ?
and we can be proud of these achievements !
we must do what all real winners do .
why do you not market your government better ?
our elderly people are among our greatest assets .
i thank him for his dedication .
perhaps his example should be followed elsewhere .
enough blood has flowed on our roads .
there is another challenge on the horizon .
our communities are tired of this intimidatory action .
that is not a point of order .
it seems to want to be the political party there .
let us look at the situation .
the beauty of it is this .
because your leader cannot do that .
it may not be closed forever .
i will have discussions with all the stakeholders .
however , i decided we should be reasonable .
the only person i fear is god .
that is life on the cape flats .
that is life on the cape flats .
the answer to that was , and i quote :
they cannot break away from history .
after all , it is only the cape flats .
they speak about the errors of the church .
there are many other things that we do .
the police know full well who they are .
this has nothing to do with politics .
it used to be among the best in the world .
it reads as follows , and i quote :
i have only looked at a few letters .
there is no good , clean government !
i call upon him to withdraw that .
i myself asked a question which remains unanswered .
no one knows how the expenditure was made .
that is the question we have to decide on .
i dare him to do it .
i am looking at it now .
we are talking about the money spent .
the chairperson of committees took the chair .
i would now like to give my ruling on that .
that is not a point of order .
there was no loss to the service .
i want to make a ruling on the matter .
that policy was conducted by the provincial treasurer .
we deposited this money into a pool .
i am not running away from the question .
on what date was the money released ?
to stop people from dying ?
i need to know the date as well .
i was not even the minister then .
i therefore cannot answer the question .
what was the date and for which financial year ?
no , we are authorising expenditure .
we speak to each amount on this document .
i do not have to mention their names .
no , i do not have to do that .
it is not a point of order !
it is not a point of order .
we are being detained here for quite a while .
we may be sitting here tonight until ten o ' clock .
we have to go and sit in a standing committee .
i shall ask the two other questions later .
you are authorising it now .
she made it to the secretary as well .
that the bill be read a third time .
it is the reality that we need to deal with .
every year we spend more than our budget .
nobody is actually concerned about these issues .
our people correctly demand integrity in political leadership .
there is no substitute for hard work .
they promised jobs for all the people .
not the national government , the provincial government .
it is in direct conflict with national policy .
why did you not lay a charge ?
i speak of the drug trade , their main business .
this is money that they should be spending .
we have the resources both physical as well as human .
the perceptions of the voters proved that .
everyone says that he was quite a good minister .
is it visible suffering against which we can act ?
there are , of course , the macro negatives .
what also struck us was the expenditure .
this will have to be worked on in future .
we appreciate the work that they have done .
i do not know if that was done .
she further said , and i quote :
this is the point which i want to emphasise .
the chairperson of committees took the chair .
i respectfully ask that it be repeated .
i cannot allow the second part .
is there anything else that she wishes to add ?
are politicians not behind this whole thing ?
what are you saying , nick ?
his answer to you is not correct .
i wonder why we have called for this debate .
what we need now is a solution .
those are the people that are suffering the most .
we have had to accompany children that are going to school .
that is not a point of order .
he is misleading the house .
yes , he can say that in general .
they are nowhere near a residential area .
why do they not fetch them ?
the applications which we received have been dealt with .
this is a new cooperative in the province .
everyone who is sitting here will have to support me .
one cannot do it overnight .
that will depend on who gets the contracts .
i am going to report back to him on the situation .
i am also going to report back to him about this sitting this afternoon .
for us , that is a very important consideration .
why was this legislation left so late ?
this document is thus not legally binding .
some of them were at stake earlier today .
i really thank him for his contribution as well .
then we have the issue of representivity .
recuse themselves from discussion on the hotels .
the chairperson of committees took the chair .
i am now going to put the two amendments separately .
further contributions will have to take place in terms of further agreements .
that is what the standing committee agreed on .
i should like to elaborate on the background of this .
the first one is the collective executive system .
it may perhaps be necessary for us to refer to that .
that is the information that i received .
it depends on the agreement reached .
unfortunately , this is what i have in front of me .
but he says he is a democrat .
oh , did they tell you nothing ?
we did not even leave the room .
they are fighting an election .
there is something he is very unhappy about .
that is not a point of order .
it is not a point of order .
i think everyone wants to finish here today .
we really tried to make progress there .
i sincerely thank him and his party for that .
he furthermore said , and i quote :
the life of this little girl has been destroyed .
why are they making such slow progress with transformation ?
we know what they have done to us .
the press tried to obtain comments .
they vote against the basic conditions of service act .
those are the issues that we have to deal with .
sir , let us say why there are problems .
sir , let us look at the road ahead .
rates levied by municipalities for municipal services
the bigger the government , the more it taxes .
this took place over the past few months .
however , i want to single out some positive points .
i regard this as a very interesting point .
in it he said , and i quote :
it is true that there are certain loopholes .
does one take their houses back or not ?
why are they doing nothing for the people ?
we must see to it that we address even this .
however , violence is resorted to , and this is cause for concern .
those concerned are working on the matter .
we are certainly prepared to do that .
would one be able to identify those deep-lying causes ?
they do not belong in our society .
i must say that i am not surprised .
i think the house should take note of that .
come on , lift the level of the debate .
show us you are the premier .
do we know about the things they do ?
commissions of inquiry cost money , time and resources .
i think that he is low and downgraded .
that is not a point of order .
however , he is a member of the cabinet .
he represents the provincial government on that board .
tell us when this all happened .
he made that statement publicly .
is there , in fact , a direct conflict of interests ?
we have not asked for that seat .
it says , inter alia , and i quote :
i am not allowed to gamble .
can we attach any credibility to his utterances ?
probably they knew where the tree was .
sir , we are filled with shock and horror .
we all have a contribution to make .
our prosperity and welfare are jeopardised .
the judge finds that democracy is the victim .
we have a wonderful country with wonderful prospects .
such things should no longer be happening .
it also sends out two very important signals .
freedom of religion reigns .
i have no cause to complain about that .
they went about this in a responsible manner .
the problem is the texture of the hair .
i now come to the hospital at prince albert .
i , too , have lost my patience with racism .
the only road here is through the ballot-box .
it reads as follows , and i quote :
i do not know how they work this out .
you are a right one to talk !
this is pure political opportunism on his part .
this is nothing but cheap politicking .
what is the relationship between employer and employee ?
that is the kind of wage they receive .
i want to know what they are going to do about it .
you are the minister and you do not know .
you always choose the farmer 's side .
sir , i have now mentioned a few examples .
why then is nothing being done about it ?
to whom does the land in the western cape belong ?
did not answer any of the questions .
we have the fewest dishonest officials .
there is a parliamentary process in this house .
i think we should congratulate him .
i just wanted to get unanimity on that point .
that is the point i wanted to emphasise .
it should not be for political gain .
it set the atmosphere for good delivery .
i think that is a very worthy cause .
i am a privileged white citizen of newlands .
there are two farmers , and a one-off payment .
the article continues , and i quote :
well , i have never been accurate before .
that is not a point of order .
they packed up and brought them all here .
that is not a point of order .
that was the strategy about two years ago .
the fact remains that the order was given .
he goes on , and i quote :
it is not allowed in the house .
we will talk about rugby , soccer and cricket .
we all thank him for this great gesture .
let me cite the west coast as an example .
strangely and suddenly his arrears were paid .
our aspirations must be directed towards the future .
they did not return to the office .
please do not waste your valuable time .
sir , the same can be said of the demarcation board .
the municipal officials also did very well .
that was another positive aspect of cooperation .
i do not think it is going to be easy .
i must say immediately that i was disappointed .
that is one of our questions .
that is a nice way of doing things .
they make a powerful case for staff members .
they were obviously totally unprepared for the debate .
perhaps he thinks he is in the eastern cape .
i think that saying applies here .
she does not even know what happened .
we need to see a plan and hear about it .
what we need is a " new civilisation " .
i hope that the cape flats heard him .
members on duty at the time of the incident were transferred .
it does not help just to complain .
unemployment remains an unacceptable economic phenomenon .
that is not a point of order .
there was no visit to that area .
you do not know where your needs are .
it is a problem in all the provinces .
during the first one , seven huts burnt down .
are supporting a lost cause .
they have lost favour with the community .
four votes and he is out .
it is a small group that is taking advantage .
it is easy to see what one problem is .
they owe this house an apology .
you are misleading the house !
we have heard many things in this debate .
what about the by-elections that you have lost ?
if it does happen , i will fight it .
why did you not do that before ?
they have been in government for six years .
a white party would not understand that .
what i myself do not understand is this .
the black middle classes are not going to get them .
he does not want to listen to the communities .
she is running the eastern cape .
we are not against the elections .
i am sure that it will be successful .
i would like to thank them for their support .
he happens to be an ardent communist , but that notwithstanding .
they have to be there to do it .
that is not a point of order .
that was not all , however .
that is not a point of order .
that was not a point of order .
it is unacceptable if it is poor service .
apartheid was wrong , and i fought it .
we will be assisting them in every possible way .
the hat can come with the head !
it is a clear example and comes from personal experience .
until today no allocation has taken place .
we need to see what we can do about this .
nobody needs to collect this tax .
i hope and trust that we also care .
we even accommodated them in the report .
they leased a building at great expense .
i must say that he started very well .
i hope that this will be a successful budget .
the chairperson of committees took the chair .
violence has become a scourge in our country .
irregular allocation of tenders has been identified and terminated .
who said it in this house before ?
we have done well in the savings department .
i want to address the issue of racism again .
they need to see that there is discipline .
to vote .
let us have an understanding on that once and for all .
they are our friends , relatives , colleagues and neighbours .
much good work has been done in this area .
there is a difference between events and programmes .
the political parties have provided names as required .
there needs to be a consolidation of this programme .
it is part of it , but not all .
it is an evil that must be rooted out .
that definitely rings a bell in my head !
the racism is to exclude people .
that is who i think we should focus on .
we should establish a clinic that deals with tb .
it is a question that goes much deeper .
the cabinet will await the proposals of the investigating team .
if they do not know , they should find out .
i again want to stretch out that hand of friendship .
i am asking them please to grow up .
i take cognisance of his comments as far as communication is concerned .
he should not sit there shouting .
they were for the community , as far as i was concerned .
the following technical amendments will be effected administratively :
the chairperson of committees took the chair .
the catering did not get off to a good start , however .
i wish to thank the officials of our parliament .
i would like to thank them on behalf of us all .
we are very grateful for this positive attitude .
and i am grateful to be corrected .
however , we are very busy with the issue .
i think the solution lies in that area .
we will take charge of the running costs .
consultation normally leads to the finding of facts .
they did not even send in an apology .
he also referred to a meeting this morning .
the thing has now been going on for two or three weeks .
is he not concerned about that development ?
why have they not yet identified it ?
development will , of course , have to take place in that direction .
those are the only cases that there were .
it was defended in the name of transformation .
it has achieved the dead opposite , entirely predictably .
that , succinctly , deals with the matter .
otherwise that is all i can say .
how were the names forwarded , and to whom ?
it was really an eye-opener .
i am looking forward to next year 's festival .
we simply do not have the money for that .
that is what we hope to achieve .
you are misleading the house !
these are cases where we do have a say .
this decision was made by the national parliament .
this was , in fact , done .
yes , i am motivating .
i cannot take any responsibility for that .
this is something which we should take seriously .
let us get together and do something about it .
we have the answers for the western cape .
we would do it our way .
we have to work together to resolve it .
it is a good thing that the department reasons that way .
i think that he just oversaw that .
there are therefore two routes for us to take .
he must not ask me .
what have we done for pensions ?
are they passing the buck ?
will the department be doing something about this matter ?
the big delay was caused by a dilemma .
they need to put a policy on the table .
she has no evidence in that regard .
the numbers involved are therefore not clear .
a calendar of events is available on request .
matric pass rate : report card fraud and stay-aways of learners
we regret it when things like this happen .
i see the official leader of the opposition .
our people correctly demand integrity in political leadership .
we are also increasing our trade with africa .
the road ahead will not be easy .
that shows what a formidable team we are .
perhaps we can consider that as a principle .
it could always cost the province .
i appreciate his kind remarks in that regard .
the chairperson of committees took the chair .
bill referred to the standing committee on finance .
i request you to rule accordingly .
that was part of the main debate here .
he has , moreover , not covered himself in glory .
it could not even open a letter of resignation .
i go further , and i quote again :
that is why it is in your office .
the necessary infrastructure for this is in the process of being established .
i think that will have to be determined .
i will have to check that against the sales .
i believe they have certain legislation in place .
if so , what precisely is the situation ?
that is where the tyre hits the tar .
it is refreshing and we appreciate that hard work .
the objects of the department of finance are clear .
i wonder what he does there all the time ?
we need to look at that issue very carefully .
i know that that is something which always worries him .
i do not know why he is still clinging to it .
we are simply asking that legislation now be instituted .
i have counted how many times he was absent .
growth is the major catalyst to create jobs .
why ?
we owe them our thanks and admiration .
in fact , it makes economic sense .
i wish him everything of the best for the road ahead .
training is important , but often it is not adequate .
this will contribute towards greater certainty and more stability .
the process of recruitment and training must be expedited .
in the meantime our women and children are paying a heavy price .
they also indicated that they would tackle crime .
the election has come and the election has gone .
there are simple solutions to some of these problems .
unfortunately they choose not to do so .
firstly , we do still need our own constabulary .
some of their members have been killed in our streets .
he talks about powers that he does not have .
he also spoke of the role of parents .
it affects their ability to perform their task .
that is a major current problem at schools .
i trust that the house will support our work .
it was when our rugby team won the world cup .
there are no sports facilities at the latter schools .
how shall we enhance performance , leadership and administrative capacity ?
another issue i would like to focus on is marketing .
we should all be justly proud of our achievements .
this visit had some very positive results .
the aged deserve our respect , love and particularly our protection .
we do , however , need much greater clarity and action .
let us get it straight once and for all .
urban terror , the bomb attacks and crime contributed towards this .
i say it again : we have to watch our words .
let us disagree with each other in this house by all means .
i would firstly like to refer to time on task .
i also wish to thank my colleagues on these benches .
these are the words of one of the principals .
then it became a long and complex process .
the grounds are impeccable and the learners are proud .
how are we to assess whether our schools have really improved ?
many people thought that things would not change .
once again this additional expenditure will handicap that desire .
this could also be a form of job creation .
i will try not to make politics out of it .
pupils have to squeeze into the classroom , three per bench .
does it mean that white children are better or more clever ?
nothing could be further from the truth .
if anybody says that , they were acting without authorisation .
i do not really wish to debate that now .
we are an enormously long way away from achieving that .
we will reward effort , especially effort in disadvantaged communities .
those are parents with the lowest incomes .
this is a small businessman who has benefited by this .
i am proud of the staff of the branch : health .
i propose that management should be held responsible for this .
the house was well-built , solid , neat and cosy .
a brain scan was only done at 8 o ' clock that evening .
much is going into structures and so forth .
he does not understand what is going on .
we hope to introduce it soon .
in my ministry we have created an advisory group .
why not a provincial council at that time ?
we will do the necessary consultation with regard to that .
i think that we are heading for a very interesting time .
she raised a very important matter concerning aids .
we are concerned and we are definitely doing something about it .
i also briefly want to refer to the strategic objectives .
that , in itself , is a major concern .
one example is the network on violence against women .
moreover , one does not see results as quickly , of course .
distress relief is the responsibility of the relevant local authority .
this is of course examined and a payment is made .
this is currently being administered by the department of welfare .
this office will , inter alia , focus on the following :
i am clearly becoming a veteran !
let us go on to the disability desk .
we are dealing with the provincial budget .
we can reach far more aged people that way .
there was a particularly strong focus on aids .
and in particular by the community of calitzdorp .
in the western cape we are not playing , we are building houses .
these are in the process of being evaluated .
they will just buy us a little more time .
i appeal for those in flats to be allowed to become homeowners .
his amendment consisted of only one word , anyway .
i said that there are hundreds and thousands of people .
i do not know what kind of society we are building .
the project has been stopped and people are homeless .
they voted for us , not for you !
you must read it correctly .
this is something that is still lacking amongst many municipalities .
this has been mentioned in the house , one occasion being the day before yesterday .
that will , i think , be a positive step forward .
the next major challenge is the demarcation of wards .
we are awaiting the necessary amendments to the legislation .
the second is the names of the new municipalities .
i think that in itself will be a challenge .
i have submitted just a few criteria to them .
one must look at how one can implement it .
i also thank the councillors and officials out there .
who was caught with their pants down ?
everything that one is engaged in gets brakes put on it .
the other piece of legislation deals with the municipal systems .
this is all part of what impacts upon transformation .
if it is blowing this way , he is happy .
and those who are dreaming of it , are busy with wishful thinking .
this proves that you were completely wrong .
we cannot be governed by proxy .
we believe that local government is not really working .
on the ground , the people are uncertain about their future .
would that not be better for our people ?
i do not want to shift the blame onto anyone .
i am not pointing a finger at them either .
we must guard against them , and we must look at this matter .
i think he made a very positive contribution .
he has come a long way in local government .
that is probably no bad thing .
i , as chairperson of the standing committee , appreciate that .
why is development planning with the department of finance ?
it is true that they were published last year .
he goes on to make the following assertion :
five years have come and gone .
provision is made in this act dealing with planning .
we should not be trying to achieve that .
i just want to explain what the cabinet resolved .
when does one decide that a matter is controversial ?
it proposed the following , and i quote :
i am far from perfect and i accept that .
i thank my department for what they have done .
i have the same problem as the chairperson of scof .
i am not saying this just for effect .
i hope to finalise this very soon .
i looked at all the information on libraries .
i found it illuminating , and perhaps disappointing as well .
i also found a very interesting item .
there could have been some confusion around that , as well .
however , there was no sign of the media .
the following technical amendments must also be made administratively :
however , the leader of the house is quite correct .
he is not speaking in the interests of the community .
i did not see it from here .
that is the point we must convey here .
we certainly owe this to one another , through service delivery .
however , the budget clearly demonstrates a lack of commitment .
public works is not unknown to the western cape .
i think it was for four to five years .
i wish him everything of the best on the road ahead .
we asked them where the money was to come from .
we must not allow that kind of legislation here .
however , i believe that the coordination is absent in this regard .
the situation there has changed very little , if at all .
i had a meeting yesterday with members from that community .
poverty is the order of the day there .
rage and frustration can be encountered in every voter there .
the sooner it is implemented , the better .
our people will not be able to afford these increases .
why do you not give them more money ?
we have the greatest appreciation for what they have done .
i would like to have heard him speak about it .
i do not know who got the tender .
we are also looking at the finances of the administration .
i must say , we had to share out the money carefully .
i do not think that we should get it .
they are man enough to look after themselves .
i do not know , but i saw his application .
that level of priority has not yet been determined .
i saw the sticker referred to .
if they do not do so , then we shall take action against them .
we shall not be put off our stroke .
they have scrutinised our budget and they have asked incisive questions .
that is a question we will come to shortly .
that is the pace at which the world is now moving .
the revenue could then be spent on provincial functions .
this illustrates the viability of cape town in this regard .
i would like to commend my department for their initiative .
yes , that is exactly why we want to change it .
that is why we have to rewrite our own legislation .
during such meetings verbal evidence and submissions were heard .
his time is up , but he may conclude .
the sale of assets is not our solution .
they are the vested interests that are represented there .
none of these have to be taken into account .
we will , of course , compliment it where it succeeds .
he is happy for himself , but not for others !
the component of the rural areas in this regard is therefore very strong .
they should therefore not lecture me .
we would have had a worse situation than we have now .
i have a problem in green point where i live .
that is part of the problem with this act .
she also mentioned the policy on informal trade .
how many people 's work is done with that machine ?
they almost wanted to start a town on the farm .
i say that people must be realistic in that respect .
in malmesbury , medium-scale farmers are losing virtually by the week .
when it comes home , they do not talk .
i am really interested in agriculture .
moreover , they share the house with another family .
what is more , bokkie takes all responsibility in the house .
they think that we only work in those so-called areas .
we would like to repeat our objection to that expenditure .
the leader of the house is moving without notice .
we should all be justly proud of our achievements .
this visit had some very positive results .
there must be criminal investigations where these are warranted .
the aged deserve our respect , love and particularly our protection .
we do , however , need much greater clarity and action .
let us get it straight once and for all .
urban terror , the bomb attacks and crime contributed towards this .
i say it again : we have to watch our words .
it is innocent citizens of this province that are suffering .
can we afford to deny our children education ?
this has been a nightmare for a long time .
i ask myself how he views life .
this action will , i trust , be condemned by all .
we can discuss everything that he spoke about .
perhaps that is the question to be answered .
the story is there for everyone to read .
and who are the cape flats in any case ?
he pointed out the problems in a certain sense .
they want to be nice , because they want to win votes .
i now wish to discuss crime in the rural areas .
in exchange for their souls , principles and their people .
it is far more difficult to tackle gang members .
the constitution states you must make a recommendation .
i get on very well with him .
i immediately sent one of my officials there .
why was he not taken in a police van ?
all they do is criticise us .
that ends the debate on the subject for discussion .
with all due respect , their argument does not hold water .
this letter contains a request made to us .
we can authorise it in terms of the act .
apparently it was switched on late owing to a technical problem .
it was for them to do their national service .
why has it been rejected and what is the contract for ?
in other provinces officials simply closed their doors .
i actually want to get to the very serious issues here .
we are big boys here , not small boys .
the local authorities struggled to get people .
they failed to do so .
i would like to make a ruling on this issue .
so somewhere the public has the right to these answers .
i will not suck anything out of my thumb .
did they not discuss it in cabinet ?
that is , quite frankly , humanly impossible .
i support my colleague who supplied the money .
however , the money was available as a consequence of savings .
on what date did this shifting of money take place ?
when exactly in this financial year was the money saved ?
people do not die in a specific month only .
they organise strikes and take teachers out of the classrooms .
if the money has been reimbursed , i am happy with it .
i will have to find out if that was the case .
i would like to ask her the following question .
i was not saying it was not teachers .
it went into the pool for the election .
you ruled that we cannot go back .
i want to stick with my ruling on the matter .
i personally think it was money well spent .
i am clear of what i am saying to her .
my information at the time was that the money was needed .
can i have an indication of how many there are ?
it sounds like a short speech , especially the beginning .
we recognise that we can still do a great deal about that .
we can use that well in this province .
it is a very , very serious situation .
i want to see to it that the strategies are implemented in practice .
our programmes and our efforts must be geared to that .
where is his plan and what is his plan ?
no one in the western cape province should feel excluded .
he said that farmers " must adapt or die " .
the people of the western cape are not fools .
what is the actual intention of the provincial government ?
i do not have to answer that question .
the poor , on the other hand , have a very rough time .
they must make an arrangement and pay the fees .
that is just how it is in our society .
this is money that they have in their account .
they would have lived a much more prosperous life .
it must tell us that it is racist .
i know the person who initiated this report .
sir , those people picked only seven boxes of grapes .
they feel that they can do as they like .
we should have declared a state of national emergency long ago .
we are very unclear on what the framework is .
we hope that this is not the case .
that is certainly of concern to me .
i hope that that will not be repeated again .
there is no plan for that at the moment .
we are now leading into the budget and finalising the budget process .
there is no need for a new policy .
one should sit down to discuss issues .
it is not a mechanical or administrative issue .
these are the people who were in the system .
i am not going to go into the details of that .
we have been called to the house for this debate .
no , it is not a point of order .
there is no way they can get away from it .
we now have the legislation , but no action .
the end of that year has come and gone .
there is no problem in identifying them .
i said it and i withdraw it .
did you know they went on the bus ?
this is not something that came about yesterday .
when any of us purchase shares , what are we doing ?
let us not do this on our own .
we dealt with them exhaustively in the standing committee .
we are not perpetrating a fraud on any other shareholders .
he will do better business if it is there .
one cannot go outside national legislation .
both agreements were therefore covered in the original text .
it seems as if there has only been a technical problem .
payments made on instruction of members of the provincial cabinet
their lies are once again emerging very strongly .
he should be careful when he utters these words .
they did not give him that information .
we gave our support in the standing committee .
we shall stand by them if they do that .
they wanted to give the executive mayor too many powers .
that was the premise on which many judgments were given .
after all , they invented democracy and perfected it .
apologise because you attacked my house .
we used those organisations to destroy apartheid .
i remember how we spoke about these things .
i also remember who was involved in the discussions .
they know that , and they know what i am talking about .
there have been three major political crimes of this century .
we fought for the right to speak .
we should say that here to one another very clearly .
we must say that to one another , too , very clearly .
we must also say that very clearly to one another .
i would like to read that reply to the house .
it has been called a number of names in the house .
that is the kind of approach that we want to take .
those are the issues that we need to deal with .
it just has to be used in the correct way .
we act as a bank in our own right .
that is exactly what this government has now done .
we appointed a black company as the fund manager .
we are creating the solutions here .
the decision was a response to an emergency type situation ;
it seems to reflect some confusion .
it does not affect the order of the house .
once again there is no difference from existing legislation .
one of those problems is the tax on infrastructure .
there is another matter that we must address .
i agree that we need an act .
that is the one thing we must prevent .
they would not even have been able to pay their officials .
it is not limited only to the farms .
we find that as an absolute trait now .
first world technology and expertise are vested in commercial agriculture .
i have not yet dealt with the motion .
they should also turn their dog on that municipality .
it is a pity he stayed next to you .
i will therefore not go into the background .
those are the people sitting on the board .
we are very happy that he has agreed with this .
moreover , we are definitely going to assist the public protector with it .
i will say everything i want to now .
more importantly , i do not think he forgot .
there are two aspects which are relevant here .
every single member of this house has an interest .
we have asked for the constitution to be applied .
could you please tell me what happened ?
i am going to repeat it , although it has been said before .
we will wait for the public protector to deal with that .
is it a risk to travel on an aeroplane ?
somewhere along the way a screw is loose .
this in itself will sow division in the community .
the western cape will not succeed while bombs are exploding .
our province and our entire community are harmed by this .
bombs are exploding and people 's lives are being threatened every day .
it was certainly not party-political in motivation .
in fact , it lasted all of last week .
i really think that it is a twofold test .
wat gee die afrikaner prys met so ' n samesmelting ?
everyone knows what the objectives of those advertisements are .
i will consider it and , if necessary , give a ruling at a later stage .
report on moneys owed by minister of social services
i do not think that is too much to ask .
at present i am aware of nine cases .
in this relationship the employer has an enormous responsibility .
this is an investment of love in the agricultural industry .
this province who do not mistreat the farm workers .
something they have never done over the years .
this has absolutely nothing to do with politics .
i repeat , he does not care about farm workers .
in such cases the law must run its course .
i shall not repeat my answer four times .
a few days later the complainant withdrew the charge .
he said that there were no grounds for prosecution .
no agreements in this regard could be provided .
does she want to ask permission to put a question ?
that is the only section we can use .
let us look at the facts of the matter .
it will have to be put off to the next financial year .
has a responsibility when disasters occur in this country .
is this really the best province , as he is claiming ?
as a principle , we do not agree with that .
it is wishful thinking taken to new heights .
however , it is not mentioned in his speech .
eighteen months later that was completely and utterly reversed .
i think they would see a very different act .
we can administer it here efficiently , effectively and equitably .
i now come to the chief whip of the opposition .
this is not going to change by ignoring it .
i put that as a challenge to the house .
the rich people , by and large , can look after themselves .
you do not sound enthusiastic . you must speak nicely .
i will speak nicely when we get to each other .
then during the day there are no vehicles .
the western cape cannot afford this to continue .
this speaks of excellent leadership and a formidable team effort .
yes , we have enough proof that that has been done .
he had his part , and let us leave it at that .
they drove the fear of god into the people .
it think it is important for us to look at that .
there were , admittedly , certain shortcoming to which i wish to refer briefly .
it is a great pity that this is the situation .
that was done without any feeling for the other members .
it is very nice to be able to use a mayoral fund like that !
they should tell those people what she gets .
yes , we will get on with the job of service delivery .
he advised them to respect the media .
i feel he has been too kind to them .
he does not even know where to find the switch !
this government stands shoulder to shoulder with those people .
we must all condemn racism in our country without qualification .
we hope they bear many good fruits .
then there was no lack of power .
it must be seen ; and our people must be conscious of it .
this is definitely a step in the right direction .
there is a way in which personal explanations are handled .
the drafting of similar legislation is therefore essential .
this , too , is a step in the right direction .
we depend on the council to demonstrate commitment .
i want to make a very limited reference to them .
we can look at the national council of provinces .
nine ministers had to answer questions , but how many turned up ?
their integrity must not be questioned .
they should rather give their support and help with advertising it .
they should rather encourage our people to get their identity documents .
i do hope i have made that point clear .
we have yet to witness any changes in education .
all these involve closed-circuit television and so forth .
first of all , we charge this cabinet with a cover-up .
i would like to put you on a polygraph .
they create the opportunity for economic growth and progress .
i would argue that we have the potential .
what about the by-elections that you lose every time ?
we say it will never happen again .
she would not think twice about it .
you cannot come and mislead the house like this !
i have been an organiser for a long time .
you are too scared to hear the truth .
somebody asked if we were not afraid .
we must stop keeping the past alive .
the incidence of hiv / aids is not diminishing .
we are taking care of the poor people of the province .
the time has come for us to act decisively .
those who know me know that i travel regularly .
i think that is not fair towards farm workers .
they are not going to get what they are asking us for .
finally , we must maintain and improve fiscal discipline .
our working together is a true exercise in cooperative governance .
they are all invited to attend .
and it is not even in this report .
the revenue from the property portfolio of the province looks promising .
we have come a long way in this province .
in this campaign he will be advancing the democratic system .
they can harp on it if they like , the caravan moves on .
unfortunately i cannot mention the amounts now .
that is true and correct , and i accept that .
i gave her a challenge in reply .
i therefore repeat what i said last year .
i think that that should be made absolutely clear here .
but he did not sit down , he continued .
i reiterate that we need to do something about it .
he also talked about the policy framework and procurement .
however , i take it like that and thank them for it .
the questions asked afterwards were good questions .
i now wish to talk about government to the people .
for far too many life is paid little respect .
it is a day to be taken seriously .
we cannot continue to be consumed by bitterness .
i was confronted and i had to tell the truth .
it is an uphill struggle to combat poverty .
the next point i wish to deal with is labour relations .
this was my first full exposure to the budgetary process .
some departments have problems with the distribution of condoms .
i now wish to turn to the issue of transformation .
there are four points that i would like to make .
let me start with the office of the premier .
we have also come a long way in transformation .
i think this issue was raised time and again .
not only the poor ; your facts are wrong .
why has the clinic not rather gone to mpumalanga ?
i agree that time is of the essence .
at the end of the day , what is happening here ?
they are going to speak to the department of public works .
they left their own youth in the lurch .
clearly she did a great deal of research for her speech .
sir , it is important that we know what is taking place .
at the first such meeting they brought people in .
in this regard , however , i must state a point of view .
we will continue to conduct our affairs in this way .
let us put the focus back on the house .
this is not how governments should be run .
will we be able to see that we have produced results ?
they administer the money themselves and look after it themselves .
this policy is a disaster from top to bottom .
that is where we stand with the process at the moment .
what was achieved as the outcome of the projects ?
the matter as reported in the press was , therefore , incorrect .
in any event , he and the commissioner are at one in this regard .
where it does occur , the law must take its course .
we are not redressing the lack of representivity .
the result has been that people have lost their lives .
he says many things but he does not do them .
i am unfortunately going to regard that as the first question .
did it have to do with outsourcing ?
if i remember correctly , his arm was still broken .
various accusations of discrimination have been put on the agenda .
safety of people on trains between cape town and paarl
focus on crimes committed in the vicinity of railway stations .
so you are asking me to find out ?
he must go and find out who issued the statement .
i did not hear what you said .
i have no knowledge of the subject matter whatsoever .
steps are being taken to rectify the situation .
it was for that reason that i answered the question in this way .
i think it was money well spent .
he initiated it and gave funding for it .
they brought dignity and splendour to the proceedings .
therefore , i commit our government now to such cooperation .
our second priority is to promote economic growth .
that report has not yet been tabled in scof .
one must take great care in that regard .
this comes from the sale of surplus wheat .
they did not say much about that , did they ?
if one sows discontent , one will reap discontent .
i must repeat it so that he can hear it .
among other things , i said , and i quote :
it is at the stage where things are being done .
she must talk when she is spoken to .
they immediately acted and something was done about it .
there was no easy walk to political freedom .
now they have the land and we have the bible .
yes , our own passiveness if the greatest threat to democracy .
it is indeed a pleasure to work with them .
it is the poor who will suffer because of this .
i went to the leaders of every political party .
from our point of view , we will be monitoring that very closely .
he should understand that the executive does have power .
yes , the wind of changing attitudes is blowing .
we know you want to tax the people of this province .
i want to talk about procurement , which he also raised .
let us understand , then , that the blame is equally shared .
then we will see how frank you can be about it .
he said that we were far ahead with our efforts .
they are always shifting things off onto each other .
it is now time for us to act more responsibly .
he should go back and read that report .
it does not only affect policemen , but their families as well .
this overview is riddled with lofty ideas and grand schemes .
this should help us to appreciate them more .
and the people out there must know what they are saying .
he is absolutely correct ; we have a major problem at the moment .
this is no way to cooperate .
do they think that this is something that we should exploit ?
in any case , he has been confused recently .
we shall continue with this programme this coming year .
this is one of the projects we shall be embarking on .
i think this debate is very fundamental to us .
centres for the disabled should also be developed in those areas .
that is a good way to do sport .
the best of luck to them in the next round .
we must continue to make the best of everything .
it is a case of good news versus bad news .
but then they must walk the talk !
we must show no mercy if this does not happen .
people have proved this over and over again in the most desperate circumstances .
it is the people in the system that effect change .
when i speak about transformation i am speaking about responsible transformation .
they are truly performing a remarkable task .
after all , the schools are the biggest assets in the community .
it will be necessary to cultivate respect for the property of others .
i believe that there will be a solution to this problem .
the by-elections are now placing an extra burden on the schools .
we hope that this will spread to all of our schools .
i thank him for raising it with me .
i just want to say to her that she is quite right .
we expect them to draw the line .
the policy on rehabilitation should include the following :
specialists always know best , particularly about the serious conditions .
the waiting time at clinics remains a problem across the western cape .
i have now looked at what he said then .
he spoke then about retaining private patients .
let us look at the impact of that on , say , mental health .
more than half of these are at lentegeur hospital .
he held this portfolio for a number of years .
i thank them sincerely for their hard work and commitment .
for instance , the problem in beaufort west should be the responsibility of agriculture .
there must be a way for us to do this .
they should be piloted in consultation with stakeholders and communities .
she did not submit plans for her own portfolio .
in my short time in office i have done my own research .
i am aware that there was one round of discussions .
i was informed that this was turned down .
the first part of the motion was perfectly in order .
today , too , a record is being set in the house .
where are the hundreds of thousands of people sleeping on the streets ?
the bill was referred to the standing committee only today .
why was not a single cent allocated to housing ?
i will unfortunately have to remove them if they do participate .
that might well be the route that we have to follow .
it is also alleged that certain local authorities are favoured .
what about a claim against the developer , a civil suit ?
there is another debate after this one , so i must conclude .
i must disestablish municipalities and establish new municipalities .
we warned them and gave them our reasons .
if it is blowing the other way , the same .
we must be careful when we talk about these things .
that is the way in which they helped poor people .
i know fire-fighting is not one of his responsibilities .
i am nevertheless disappointed , because it is ultimately his responsibility .
we are treated as agencies only by central government .
i feel that the reason for this is the transformation that is taking place .
the only sad aspect is who is receiving the financial training .
i see that their budget does make provision for this .
when we look at local government , we must act responsibly .
i think we must also see it in that perspective .
he tried to bring some politics into the debate .
i almost want also to absolve him of blame today .
such actions are irresponsible on the part of the councils .
that is completely correct , the demarcation board went through that process .
there are certain reasons for this , and we know that .
this is all about local government , and that is the most important thing .
i will bear the points he mentioned in mind .
i am sure that it will make very interesting reading .
i will have to talk to the minister of finance about that !
it is true that they have been to the standing committee .
we must understand that it is not about politics .
i am not saying that the environment is not important .
what do we have in the lower ranks of this department ?
the decision was not taken by the full cabinet .
however , this matter was not taken to cabinet .
i will tell him who moved the motion .
yes , again , and exactly that because i mean it .
i agree that all of these issues are very important .
you are throwing the house into disarray .
the risk to our young girls and daughters is horrific .
would this be regarded as popular culture in the province ?
a very big task awaits them .
we have asked questions on how the money was spent .
your people out there cannot eat politics , ma ' am .
you are not going to get them fat on politics !
madam chairperson , i invite the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs to go to hermanus and speak to the people .
i will repeat what i said in my speech :
one can imagine the pain of those people .
however , i did not hear anybody say that .
he then resumed his seat . so he has finished speaking .
improve the quality of service delivery by the department of transport ;
i know that they do not always have an easy time .
in overseas countries world-wide advertising produces an enormous amount of wealth .
i challenge the department in this regard .
it is clear that those proposals have been swept aside .
their apples are among the earliest on the market .
yes , it is local government , but these are provincial roads .
after that one was withdrawn , the next tender was advertised .
we hope to finalise it as soon as possible .
he referred to the white paper and the integrated transport policy .
we shall see to it that that road is properly upgraded .
let us forget about what the name of the department is .
if it is a constitutional arrangement , we must rectify it .
i say that we should simply get on with the work .
if there is a problem , we shall address that problem .
yes , but it can be better utilised by other people .
i want to thank everyone who is supporting us with personal number-plates .
i thank him for the contribution he made .
the same applies in the case of accidents , death and disasters .
the whole aspect of asset management is like a beautiful driving course .
that was more than two and a half years ago .
as has been said , the social cost is enormous to the province .
stop showing your ignorance ; it is ridiculous .
it need surprise no one that this is the case .
i shall deal with some of her comments in that regard a little later .
one has to be very sensitive in how one deals with it .
however , i cannot agree with him about import substitution .
this is also a major prerogative for the province .
i do not think we disagree in this regard at all .
the constitutional court said that the bill was unconstitutional .
he can go and tell that to the people who were excluded .
the most important history is the history we make today .
" what can we as the government do to reach out ?
however , measures can be taken to manage the problem .
that is the need of agriculture in the western cape .
i am not happy that people are exploited .
it is now once again time to fight an election campaign .
why then be concerned about the possible abuse of diesel ?
we are going to follow the same route as far as the textile industry is concerned .
however , he earns twice what she does .
the farm has been bringing in good money for years .
i wonder whether he listened to my entire address .
i believe that things will also go better in future .
it is true that extension is available to everyone .
i have never seen that on a farm .
it is true that we have to look after our workers .
the debate has been concluded ; we are now voting on the schedule .
we would like to obtain clarity regarding the legality of this .
i did not realise that they would be opposed to it .
the best of luck to them in the next round .
we must continue to make the best of everything .
it is a case of good news versus bad news .
but then they must walk the talk !
we must show no mercy if this does not happen .
a better understanding and dynamic management are needed in this sphere .
it is about violence , intimidation and the infringement of rights .
we did not think it was right there .
what we are saying is that we need firm measures .
they walk in the dark in order to catch the bus .
i was terribly sad when i heard the news .
it is a case of saying you might as well murder one another .
this is why billions of rand are spent on armed forces .
criminals more often than not walk free .
the question is whether the speaker in fact did so .
every child has a right to freedom of movement .
our areas need to be upgraded as a matter of urgency .
that is the big problem we are faced with .
they are engaged in a running commentary ; it is his turn to speak now .
zero tolerance cannot be applied under those circumstances .
but he does not praise the police , he undermines them .
the finding was that the police did act correctly .
one thing runs through the reports like a golden thread .
with that as the background we incurred that unauthorised expenditure .
what should we have done if nobody had turned up ?
that is what is in the bill before us .
we do not know ; were you gambling there ?
they knew full well what was happening .
that is the fear on that side of the house .
i am not sure whether any arrangements have been made .
we need to apply our minds to the authorisation of this expenditure .
today is not the occasion to question this .
it is one person 's word against another .
he is the minister now and he is therefore responsible .
my department is the department that pays out pensions and grants .
they might ask for that money because it is savings .
he told me that there had been a reimbursement .
at examination time some teachers do invigilation and others are free .
i think that there ought to be a place for consistency in this .
it was only for one purpose and for one service .
we could not get the reply from anybody else .
that is not the way to do it .
if they do not object , they should say so .
we are not raising this as a frivolous matter .
we should have made those decisions beforehand in our rules .
we hear for the first time a list of names .
unfortunately the list is not at my disposal at present .
yes , i know , but it is money spent .
i have no jurisdiction over the work of other ministers .
let us not speak to other people 's ministries .
many things can happen before the end of the financial year .
the house cannot proceed with the third reading .
in fact , the people have moved on .
while we were relaxing , they were working .
the highest crime rates occur in the western cape .
it is just a pity that it came so late .
much knowledge has been gained about gangs and their activities .
we have found him and we must get his plan .
we are seeking a positive commitment and dedication to this matter .
sir , all i can say , is : what a province !
this article gripped every compassionate citizen in this province .
this naturally includes the supporters of all political convictions .
if this pillar totters , it could lead to large-scale chaos .
can one wonder why they lost the election ?
how is that for an understanding of democracy ?
how is that for an understanding of democracy ?
such is the mood swing of the people .
he will probably reply and ask why there is this concern .
he should walk the walk before he talks the talk .
he has given us the bones without the beef .
i know the person who went to that farm .
through his doing there was a strike on the farm .
the aim of the plan is to ensure that rural areas get new life .
there are other law-abiding citizens who are waiting for the same houses .
to my shame i have to admit that he is from worcester .
that is where the people go who are in distress .
there are , however , doubts about the accuracy of these benefits .
that is the war we should be engaged in .
the americans say that in politics perceptions are reality .
only now was he seriously beginning to consider using condoms .
it is enough to drive one to desperation .
it has been a pleasure working with him this year .
the matter is now in the office of the premier .
one should always try to avoid such changes .
there are to the best of my knowledge no other relationships at all involved .
so that is why i am making this point of order .
i wonder whether all of us here are entirely innocent .
when he speaks , one has to know that something is behind it .
he does not say yes nor does he say no .
i did not refer to any person in the house .
we believe that he owes it to the people .
we cannot accept that violence has to happen .
so , the cousin or someone else stands in for them .
the issue is fast-tracking the issuing of permits .
that was the thing that was worrying her most on that morning .
why have we been called to a session of the house ?
their government must talk about blood on their own hands .
that is what we are busy with in this debate today .
it is there where we need to see something happening .
he goes further in that promise , and i quote :
i do not believe that has even started .
two days later i received a reply from him .
i am in telephonic contact daily with the national minister .
we disposed of all the applications that we received .
i ask them why they do not collect those permits .
i am not confusing two things .
and this is what i am doing .
it is not enough , but we have obtained people .
we have to negotiate in a way in which we trust one another .
she worked many long nights to make this possible .
the other things that occur in between can still be done .
we have never said that we do not support it .
for the most part conferences will focus on bringing in overseas clients .
in this other document we are called something completely different .
three of those men are black ; the rest are white .
is it the city of cape town or is it the province ?
this is a really wonderful way to involve them .
sometimes one can never really satisfy people .
i must congratulate her on picking that up .
we have white and black expertise assisting the board .
he is doing everything he can to support it .
such an extension can be foreseen now .
we are talking about procedures which have not been followed properly .
it is the first time we have seen it .
there can be different types of municipalities for the different categories in this .
i am surprised that it has not been corrected .
i cannot sit in judgment on these arrangements .
all i am appealing for is : get people on your side .
it was the only way in which we could avert it .
this is necessary if we want to develop a healthy democracy .
politeness does not help to get a bill passed .
he is supported by many other eminent jurists in this view .
my party respects the integrity and independence of this institution .
we need to make sure that transformation is a key aspect .
that was not democracy ; that was a political compromise .
the point is we must think about our people .
in this province , coloured people have had a very raw deal .
it does not matter from which community it comes .
that is an admission which i think should be investigated .
in addition to that there are other minor amendments of a technical nature .
these are the facts and we have all read it .
we should not begin to tell the voters lies .
a flabby , overweight bureaucracy does the poor no favours .
ratepayers are wrong to focus entirely on the bill .
worcester owes no one anything ; all its accounts are paid .
i hope that i will be able to contribute to the debate .
he speaks about the services that are not supplied .
there was no reason to keep it secret .
it is where you did it that is wrong .
why are certain traditional authority areas excluded from this entire matter ?
from where i am sitting , it is very difficult to hear .
violence contributes towards the poor image of agriculture .
it is social conditions of this kind to which i referred .
there are many other mechanisms to address that .
in that regard our message must not be ambiguous .
agriculturalists cannot farm behind bars or high walls .
let us speak out loud and clear against crime .
it seeks to do the following , and i quote :
in this regard i wish to turn to the bill itself .
ask him how many times i have told him so .
if this were the case , would i have done this ?
i would not have , because we stand by what we say .
however , i will also obtain legal advice before i do so .
no , it is fine , do not worry .
i put him to the test ; that is not the truth .
this state of affairs is also damaging our country .
it is scaring investors away and it is making the country unsafe .
more must be done to make the cape peninsula safe .
in the meantime the charge-sheet is getting longer by the day .
how do things like the events of last tuesday come about ?
that discussion brought us to where we are today .
the second is that free political activity is under threat .
that is the opposite view of what i am trying to disprove .
it is then expected that they will state this openly .
we had a comprehensive meeting to deal with it .
we must do it , and not only talk about it .
racism is a cancer , and affected areas must be amputated .
the road to the provincial parliament is through the ballot-box .
i can agree wholeheartedly with some parts of the motion .
those are the kind of issues which have come up .
they called him a hero with feet of clay .
i must admit that there was some confusion .
organised agriculture is independent and can take its own decisions .
he can only react reasonably to reasonable demands .
i shall try to handle it as a point of order .
he should let me speak and try to listen .
it is not the government that should be creating jobs .
we must not do only what is politically correct .
they have both been here , but we need to encourage them more .
i have the latest figures on drugs in the area .
i do not need to dream ; they are having a nightmare .
why is your hair standing up as if you are having a nightmare ?
he used them and he did it effectively .
to rise above the level of his colleagues .
we do not need to reiterate this over and over .
what do you have to say about the farmers who are being killed ?
i could not believe what the residents wanted to do .
i could not stay there for more than half an hour .
some of them have had an association with the previous governments .
every day of the week the place is absolutely filthy .
i am afraid that they are not going to do that .
does he want to argue that it was an untruth ?
in many instances , the quality of these products is bad .
so much has been said about making the environment safer .
we are definitely marching on and we are definitely going to achieve success .
they must bring us the results for this province .
people have hopped from one party to another .
and they still try to make a big noise about it here .
i advise him to follow his own head .
even if it is not now , we will win .
most probably the community will not be consulted one hundred per cent .
we have received a number of complaints and there are various problems .
his first appearance indicates great promise for the future .
i share his earnestness about enhanced economic development and job creation .
i think that this contributes substantially to nation-building .
he went to say , and i quote :
this is done after careful assessment of the learners .
the school insists that it is a secular school .
now she does not even know what she did .
much more has to be done to help the poor .
he listens actively to the views and opinions of others .
if we want to win this is our challenge .
the events of yesterday served as further proof of this .
in fact , it has diminished their credibility .
we also have high rates of tuberculosis .
at each school there are two or three empty classrooms .
at present we are hampered by crime , corruption and urban terrorism .
we still have to see what work has been done by them !
they are not going to win again ; we will show them .
in culture , transformation is the order of the day .
it is also , then , our duty to look after it .
i wish the council strength with its enormous responsibility .
the plight of our soldiers should be evaluated .
the coalition government is off the agenda in the province .
what we have seen here over the past week is cause for concern .
that is why there is great unhappiness amongst these people .
there is nothing left for them in the eastern cape .
such expansion can be linked to either domestic markets or exports .
that is really the question they are faced with .
what is the way that we can best contribute ?
and they are paid to come here anyway .
no , we do not allow ourselves to be led by the nose .
for all these years we have chosen our own course .
that is the message i have for the house .
there was not a single woman in that parade .
she is running the eastern cape and she wants to run everything else .
we do not know whether they transferred people there .
it is not becoming very irritating .
they say that crime is important , so they must listen .
is that how we want to promote loyalty to our province ?
many other hard decisions had to be taken during the year .
we can no longer take refuge in cautious ambivalence .
that is why the farmers are now switching over to technology .
let me make my final point .
he said that we should deliver to the poor .
there is no intention to mislead the house .
containing expenditure on the big three .
usually a statement does not last longer than three minutes .
by doing that we have all seen the results .
i owe it to the people of this province .
let us not close the door or break down policies .
i also want to thank the department for the strategic policies .
i do not see why they should carry on like that .
the officials should feel willing to impart any knowledge .
i am merely saying that i have tried to adopt that principle .
i would like to thank the chairperson and members of scof .
it is the simplest thing in the world to do .
he said that i delayed matters with the regulations .
i know no other way in which to deal with matters .
therefore i cannot accept that it is anything else .
he may wish to take the matter further .
they were able to take it away with them and give it consideration .
i believe if we do that we can be successful .
combating poverty is a massive challenge for us .
what if protection such as gloves are not available ?
they should also be well-planned prior to the relevant trip .
only they did that , and i congratulate them .
these are exactly the kind of points that we continue to raise .
i would like to raise a couple of issues in that regard .
where have we heard that , other than in this house ?
the dissemination of information is entrenched in our national constitution .
the last sentence is of relevance , and i quote :
that is the support i am getting from my department .
if i say it in afrikaans , he will understand it .
he did so very neatly , and i thank him for that .
i think we should shift the focus to the house .
let us get the focus to fall on parliament again .
the public relations component of the provincial parliament is non-existent .
why did he not consult the council ?
the public should always be treated with courtesy and consideration .
it was not an appeal before me .
why am i chairperson of this group ?
if he has evidence , let him bring it .
that is not to say that i attribute it to arson .
why are they afraid to make that land available ?
this happens in most cases in a family context .
i will therefore table it . the breakdown is also available from the department on request
i have three questions on the question paper for written reply .
he asks a question and then gives the answer as well .
i do not know whether they have published that or not .
black people , brown people and white people must be dealt with in the same way .
where incidents of this kind occur , he should demonstrate stronger leadership .
he phoned me and asked if i could assist .
the standing committee was prevented from doing this .
i am not in charge of the standing committee .
however , i am afraid much has not happened .
they have asked us what our solutions to africa are .
if we respect one another 's culture , we can learn a great deal .
it is not being done by an outside firm .
for the last two months he did not work at all .
sir , it is necessary to state the following clearly :
they put discrimination into reverse just where it suits them .
one also has to consider the background of the matter .
or was he pushed and fell off that wagon ?
you have just said you will investigate it .
transport is a provincial competence and it is their responsibility .
that is a long time after the constitution was accepted .
because he is also the perpetrator of one of those deeds .
i am pleased to note that we are succeeding .
we unanimously adopted the report we produced .
but i think the problem is much more serious than that .
i am sure that it will be taken up by the department .
it is therefore important for us to implement them .
i mentioned it at the end of my opening address .
then , of course , there is the request for a secret ballot .
i am sure that would make some difference .
this year we will probably be making four visits .
we get things done by not politicising them .
that is the department of home affairs officials .
it is the department of home affairs officials .
these are our efforts to get it even better .
i wonder whether you could attempt to control the situation .
once hope is destroyed , the value of our existence is diminished .
if we had received it , we would have been very happy .
it received tremendous criticism , and look at where it is today .
it is a fact that we now have the national framework .
it is easy , and we can do it at any time .
let us sit down , and let us get the universities involved .
if you come here and say that , have you reported them ?
again it is a chicken-and-egg situation .
that means that he has achieved a certain measure of success .
that is not by accident ; no , it is done deliberately .
this is one way in which the community can become involved .
however , there are four questions i should very much like to ask .
education and health have a contribution to make in this regard .
crime is the most serious issue to all the people of this province .
thirdly , i would like to talk about morale in the police services .
i am pleased to hear it coming from the top .
i would like to thank you for your support in this regard .
we had many dis-cussions about transforming the police .
what he did not quote , was the very next paragraph .
i have no authority over the transformation of the police service .
he had nothing to do with the implementation thereof .
he was peripherally involved with the idea previously .
we therefore have to provide security at the courts for those prisoners .
i was asked whether there is coordination between the various departments .
we work very closely with social services on this matter .
it is not meant to generate publicity as such .
this situation is not healthy for this country .
she has made a great contribution towards sport in this province .
a lot of money seems to be needed in these areas .
i would like to focus a little on the question of school sports .
but now , we move on to the more serious business of the day .
the coalition is working well despite attempts to make it stumble .
we need to improve our record to reach even greater heights .
we need to become an even greater economic player in the global economy .
give us the tools and we will finish the job !
it is a laudable project which this province will actively support .
i believe that is a step in the right direction .
skilful , good governance , based on sound administrative skills , is a prerequisite .
she should give her ears more of a chance than her mouth .
i can , of course , take absolutely no credit for this performance .
i also wish to express my thanks to all of their senior colleagues .
we are a very long way away from that objective .
this is a development eagerly anticipated by many high schools .
this is what i speak about when i refer to " hard choices " .
for change to be successful , it must be systemic .
it has to take a long time to happen .
it is truly a great privilege to follow him .
everyone must have a will to succeed .
for the first time schools themselves have to pay for municipal expenditure .
but why was it necessary to object first ?
the public at large should be able to display confidence in the system .
let us consider some of the changes that have taken place .
we were disadvantaged by apartheid and it must be changed now .
we do not understand what we are supposed to do .
time will tell and we can discuss it then .
we have to look at the future and we have to take responsibility .
i have tried very hard to argue against this trend .
we really appreciate that and look forward to it in the future .
i salute the principals and teachers who manage that .
these need to , and can be , rectified as a matter of urgency .
they demand high standards of hygiene in wards , toilets and waiting-rooms .
he said we cannot allow this to continue .
he was part of the rationalisation of health in this province .
it is a decision that we took at that level .
in the nature of the matter that is not possible .
yes , i know what the conditions are in respect of trauma .
one should choose those things that can make a difference .
the first is the wynberg and mitchells plain magisterial districts .
i move on to the services to abused women and children .
i just want to say that we can examine the various models .
i just want to mention one or two advantages of this system .
secondly , all unclaimed benefits will be available in the following month .
let me commit myself to expedite its development .
however , these actions are not sufficient and should be extended .
these children then get involved in crime in order to survive .
however , i think we need to get to the bottom of it .
we do not need more money ; the buildings are there .
i want to single out certain points discussed in the debate .
it is true that aids contributes towards poverty .
in general i experienced the comments as very positive .
he must present his draft resolution in the form of a motion .
are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice ?
the majority of people who lived there rented their property .
i also want to thank the officials who were so patient this morning .
it is not good enough to talk about grabouw .
those are things initiated by those local authorities .
families are broken up because the houses cannot accommodate everybody .
informal settlements are a typical example of what i am talking about .
this is one of the challenges facing us .
he also referred to the legislation that was approved this morning .
it therefore is not a question of our being disorganised .
let me now correct this matter , since the question has been asked .
another important aspect is the appointment of staff .
we must recognise that and see how they can be rectified .
this is one of the important points that we have identified .
how do we see the future of local government in this province ?
at this stage there have been no representations in terms of the legislation .
i think it would be a sad day if that happened .
we saw this with the last disaster , during the fires recently .
there is no doubt about that and we are concerned about it .
the national minister for provincial and local government brought out legislation .
] i think that an assistant is something completely different from a mayor .
these were all very good tips that he gave us .
however , i shall not easily permit this in future .
i want to know how we can do provincial planning without land .
it is being administered by the national minister of agriculture and land affairs .
in september we were told that the draft had been completed .
there is nothing wrong with this , and recent court cases prove it .
in this regard i refer in particular to the remote rural areas .
i cannot help it , but now i am going to be mischievous .
and also a little disappointed , that he did not catch me out .
no , but thank you for giving me the opening .
local communities are involved and their needs are taken into consideration .
i owe her a lunch and she knows that .
the commission has the task of administering the following aspects .
it is not the first time that this has happened .
in one particular year they saved quite a big amount .
i am determined to see the orchestra survive .
that is mainly why he missed me .
the appointment will be made before the end of this financial year .
they must accept the damage that they have done to my people .
i trust that we will have more order in the house .
house in committee :
this is the type of partnership that we envisage .
works is planning to utilise the allocated funds as follows .
it is not that they have not tried .
what happens if he is unable to make representations to pretoria ?
what about the man in the street who cannot read or write ?
it is because money was not budgeted for this division .
it is important when schools take responsibility upon themselves and use initiative .
i am not referring to a company , but to the adverts .
they cannot obtain security and guarantees from the banks .
at this stage we are doing what we can .
in some cases this can also be detrimental to the environment .
i thank him for his contribution to transport in this province .
i want to thank him for his support of the personal number-plates .
some members of the public received a whole series of numbers .
we must be man enough to tell them .
we want to thank them , too , and he did so .
the school has , however , been vandalised to a very great extent .
this is the information i have obtained from the inspector .
however , we are prepared to see whether there are problems .
are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice ?
are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice ?
that is a valid point and i shall consider the matter .
house in committee : the chairperson of committees took the chair .
the result is that businesses do not employ people .
our clothing industry and the agricultural sector have suffered greatly in this regard .
we hope to give effect to this by way of our institutional advantages .
the department is currently finalising these and other aspects of the white paper .
this process poses particular challenges , and is not taking place without problems .
the western cape does not have great mineral wealth .
with a few exceptions , they are simply not represented there .
it is a project that we are busy with at this stage .
it is just how we use our management which is appropriate .
it is probably one of the most difficult issues to deal with .
we are all in our separate ways battling that .
that is what i did and i am proud of it .
and what have you done to address the problem ?
in fact , i cannot remember receiving any .
bill not referred to committee of whole house .
in the case of wheat there are no such alternatives .
in this we shall be supported by the national department of agriculture and land affairs .
job creation is the key to the survival of our rural areas .
it is definitely true that the economic potential for agriculture is shrinking .
what can we , and particularly as a government , do for the agricultural sector ?
this is not to the benefit of the agricultural industry or the farmers .
the answer is of course that the old situation will simply be repeated .
the budget of the national assembly has just been discussed once again .
agriculture in the western cape is mainly focused on the export market .
there is nothing that we can do on this side .
they make the finest rosettes one has ever seen .
in fact there was nothing on which he could differ with me .
once that has been clarified we would like to support the initiative .
but now , we move on to the more serious business of the day .
we need to improve our record to reach even greater heights .
we need to become an even greater economic player in the global economy .
give us the tools and we will finish the job !
it is a laudable project which this province will actively support .
i believe that is a step in the right direction .
i am not saying it ; they say it .
skilful , good governance , based on sound administrative skills , is a prerequisite .
we did not think it was quite right there either .
they made such a fuss about it that i was astonished .
it is , in the first place , also about hooliganism and crime .
it is not that i feared for my life .
let us just for a moment take the politics out of the situation .
our women and children are dying , but there is no urgency .
it is a case of doing the right thing and disappearing .
today we must speak out and if we do not , then the shots will continue to be fired .
in this country the courts are sovereign , not parliament .
they have not made jails something which criminals fear .
he rightly discussed the torture and suffering of children .
i listened throughout and heard nothing about possible measures .
the suffering is not owing to the death only .
here they are not even free in their own backyards .
for that i wish to congratulate him , but not the former .
where are the votes today that they won in malmesbury ?
however i am very sorry that he misused the opportunity .
at the end of the shift they close the doors .
this has everything to do with the reality of the situation .
the finding was that the police had been alert and taken the correct action .
in that case a country runs a very dangerous risk .
i cannot rule him out of order for that reason .
that was the kind of pressure under which the western cape province was placed .
when we authorise this legislation here today , it will be authorised expenditure .
very probably that might have prevented what is happening now .
and if nobody had turned up , what should we have done ?
no one knows how it was allocated to the various departments .
i take my hat off to him and salute him for his actions .
you are running away from the real issue .
there has not been one accusation against us in that regard .
i am allowing no one to speak to procedures again .
however , i would like to say something about your point of clarity .
they can take it to the standing committee on public accounts .
any health department will never ever decline more money .
secondly , how many hours did they spend in this type of work ?
i do not believe that that is what we must do .
my question is : where were cuts made , where would there be cuts ?
this did not happen , and this is the case .
i would like to know how that process of condemnation will take place .
then we cannot proceed with the third reading .
i have some difficulty with the wording of the motion .
they come from across the world to study it here .
why are houses in mpumalanga bigger than in the western cape ?
however we are not the only ones responsible .
yes , perhaps there should be handshakes on the beaches .
we must be able to clearly observe the implementation of the plan , the programme and the action .
this culture of violence must be eradicated root and branch .
it has a divide and rule scheme among the oppressed .
the prosperity that we are talking about can only be for the few .
if there were no market this trade would die .
they have no money and they are also very proud .
they do not care about the poorest of the poor .
i also extend my thanks to the officials of this parliament .
let me not dwell too much on the elections .
is it the case that empty vessels make the most noise ?
we announced earlier that we were rolling out to six new areas .
sixteen other countries have responded , the majority being from africa .
where is the epicentre of that counter-force that i am referring to ?
we can be very proud of the quality of our officials .
i would like to understand whether that is acceptable in terms of the standing rules .
however , i shall happily provide some bait for him !
they have given input and differed with us on certain issues .
i do not think that the line of his speech is correct .
the sooner we find a solution to these issues the better .
it was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life .
we need a major commission of inquiry into this aspect .
i am worried about the situation in the house .
he was able to close them , because they are in an isolated area .
the chair will certainly deal with that if that is the case .
by the end of next month we will increase the membership .
nobody must say to me that i have acted hastily .
we do not need a new transport policy in the province .
i can give them everything , but then i get nothing .
it is possible that they may persuade people to talk .
that is why it was not slotted in at this position .
in other words , there is a power of veto for each public entity .
in regard to purchasing shares , we have taken legal counsel .
we have not had an opportunity to consider it .
in no sense can that be applied to anybody else .
we tried obtaining clarity in the standing committee .
one needs new agreements to make that happen .
investigation into malpractices and allegations of racism at prince albert hospital
we must clearly understand that we are dealing here with a menu .
do not worry , we shall stand with you , brother !
we had , therefore , done what we were supposed to do .
that is the nature of politics , of preservation and survival .
i want to emphasise that in this way the say of communities is totally ignored .
why did they not turn up to ask the questions ?
that is because they themselves decided to be excluded .
i had not wanted to mention this , but they are harping on it .
i think that everyone in the house wants local government to work .
bill not referred to committee of the whole house .
they are not above the law and the constitution .
that action was manipulation and interference ; criticism is not interference .
they want to win this election on the back of the coloured people .
he knows how we had to fight against riots and the like .
it is absolutely transparent what the aim behind this motion is .
they want to drive a wedge in the coalition government in the western cape .
what we need to discuss is the political analysis of this drama .
compare that opposition to what they are speaking of now .
whatever one does , one must do it .
once the application has been processed , she looks forward to the reply .
this is the reply to her application , and i quote :
that is the reality that faces black businesses today .
if those people give thought to this comment , they will understand .
we do not deal with them from an economic development perspective .
that is where government can actually take a direct role .
are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice ?
the question of rates has always been a very emotional matter .
they did not even get pavements from that local authority .
we must encourage every single one to pay their rates .
i had really thought that we should take the discussion further .
to begin with we must accept that a municipality has to collect rates .
i have never heard anyone differ in that regard .
that is the message that the people out there must receive .
i do not say that poor people should not be assisted .
madam , we shall have to see to it that sound financial control is established .
it is the most important element in the economy of the province .
violence on farms usually ends in murder , assaults , theft and rapes .
i will give a ruling at the end of this debate .
it is necessary to have a comprehensive strategy to address this problem .
these include increasing security measures both inside and outside the farmhouse .
agriculture cannot produce if attackers are paralysing it .
let us condemn the criminals and take vigorous action against them .
that is the least we can do about the matter .
i am prepared to put the rest of the motion .
bill not referred to committee of the whole house .
are they going to ignore their moral obligations and cover this issue up further ?
if they have thrown in the towel they must say so openly .
when we open the newspapers we practically read about it every day .
he has been very involved with what has been happening in that municipality .
we are pleased that he is willing to do so .
i will pre-empt that and say that i will behave myself !
his family will definitely benefit from the developments taking place .
let us firstly see what a conflict of interest is .
we got the city council to work together .
the fact is , sir , that this is a megaproject .
they are strengthening my resolve to fight even harder than before .
my disclosure was not the only one on the table .
at the time there were two disclosures from two other directors .
i was not present for the disclosure of interest item .
at the same time we are all losing confidence in the government of the day .
this is happening while our children and our parents are being killed !
these explosions have been going on for some time on a continuous basis .
together the two will serve six years of community service outside of jail .
i believe that the malaise is much more profound than that .
the first responsibility of government remains the safety of its people .
firstly , the rule of law must prevail .
it took him a few dismissals to get there .
i could understand that and to some extent would accept it .
the motion before the house today attempts to do the same .
and we also see it in every debate in the house .
how does he define a black person and are there different categories of black people ?
it is in the poorest of taste and is deeply offensive .
we can only eradicate racism through reconciliation and transformation .
in his song , called war , he says , and i quote :
we have the academy , we have technikons and we have universities .
notice will have to be given to that effect in the house .
we will therefore include his motion as a point of order .
we agree that agriculture is a critically important sector .
on that farm people have been assaulted in the past too .
a farmer who has committed a crime must suffer the consequences .
it seems to me that they have forgotten about their own people .
no , sir , i want to know whether he will take an answer .
why do they persistently maintain that farmers treat their workers so badly ?
eighty percent of those found guilty were black people .
no written support has been requested or supplied by the western cape .
perhaps it is because of his background of communist activities .
my conclusion is that he does not care about those people .
can this be true when schools are the battlefields of gangsters ?
i am the premier of all the people of the western cape .
this speaks to making facilities available to previously disadvantaged communities .
we support the way in which they work with the national government .
for example , we have no policy framework for poverty alleviation .
if there is one , will they please show it to us ?
however , the government continues to stumble and bumble .
with an opposition party that is strengthening rather than weakening .
they do not have the mandate that they say they have .
these are the people who say that they are ruling the province .
the election results showed us what has happened in macassar .
banner has stopped his hair growing .
i know all that , but the judge criticised you people .
he is not our judge , he is everyone 's judge !
it is a council that sells it , not the people .
and could not convince his people of what was right .
he lost george , he lost oudtshoorn , he lost everything .
as previous speakers have pointed out , the election results show this very clearly .
as such let the opposition be constructive for the benefit of service delivery .
i want to see that we do some economic development there .
there are no racists on this side of the house .
that is what we must say to one another in this country .
i would like to support large parts of what he said .
constructive participation and cooperation will have to be the watchwords this year .
they had that whole department and nothing happened .
over the last two days these intentions have become very clear .
improper management of affairs by the farmers has deepened the crisis .
prices are low due to overproduction of apples and white wine .
in fact , of late he has received a number of awards .
the process has to continue , and we must truly support one another in it .
not all criticism is destructive criticism .
it is the old story of the fishing rod and the fish .
i know that we have much to be proud of .
crime and drugs are a matter of serious concern to us all .
this is a democratic principle which many still find obscure .
that is why the integration in our schools is taking such a long time .
he is someone who hears when one talks to him .
they had to get full powers and the money that went with them .
there is always room for improvement as far as tourism and business management are concerned .
i am not alleging that nothing is being done .
at each school teachers are discharged from time to time .
i wish to make an earnest appeal to all responsible public representatives .
he can put his case as he wishes .
why did he look at the situation of so few people ?
other people have been encouraged to buy houses in the province .
what kind of communication does she have with the women of this province ?
i respect this and i am interested in listening .
there is a saying that too many cooks spoil the broth .
we must walk the talk for them too .
i will take a question as soon as i have completed my speech .
that also applies to magazines and so on .
they have failed the electorate of the province .
that is what he thinks of the poor in the province .
and their people will forgive them for what they have done .
the ministers are simply never available to answer questions .
it is clear that there is a cover-up and political interference .
they do not ask where one lives and where one comes from .
true democracy is the key to a safe and prosperous western cape .
that is the challenge which i would like to put to them .
fortunately though , they are also coming round to seeing through him .
however , i will give the matter consideration and give a final ruling .
i appreciate being able to take part in the debate today .
no , i do not think he read the article .
we have seen not even one change brought about .
we do not know what they are going to do with the addresses .
we do not want to put people at risk in this way .
the disease exists and it is killing people .
i now want to tell hon members about something that i experienced .
eliminating friction in the community .
the urgency of transformation is nonetheless increasing steadily .
he is speaking the whole time , but i cannot hear him .
currently things are not going at all well in the rural areas .
however , all those powers in the constitution are not being used .
the following points should be stressed in relation to provincial own revenue :
when he indicates that then one knows that this is it .
what is distressing is that we have limited powers and resources .
it is regrettable that we did not have the necessary finances .
with this tie one does not need a hooter .
those people do not even have places to stay here .
it is a budget for that side of the house as well .
frankly , i am getting very tired of it .
what is happening to the national minister for the public service and administration ?
and we expect it to be done in a constructive manner .
this means that allocations to our provinces will continue to change significantly .
we commemorate international day for the elimination of racial discrimination later this month .
in the nature of the matter the department will also develop their own capacity for support services .
it is not envisaged that this division will be further decentralised .
i now come to the activities of the cape administrative academy .
investigations are being carried out in the furthest corners of the province .
support services renders divergent services to the various departments within the administration .
even our directors do not think that it is really their problem .
demographic criteria also ignore notions of individual merit , application and choice .
this situation is clearly unacceptable for any parliament anywhere .
if this department is not working , we have a great problem .
we are dealing with this and will develop it in the course of this year .
we cannot simply speak about transformation year after year .
i must say that it is the first time in history .
for organised security , parking , decoration and identification , we need space .
the provincial parliament has been done down for too long .
no , that cannot happen , and we need to think again .
the challenge that remains , however , is the implementation of that policy .
this enhances the dignity of parliament and of its members .
my information is that they are busy with that at the national parliament .
even if they did have access , what could they do with it ?
he is wrong and he must admit that he is wrong .
we will therefore now proceed directly to questions for oral reply .
our process to create the strategy has entailed the following :
the report was prepared in conjunction with a team of technical experts .
it may have been done in a week 's time or in a month 's time .
secondly , we shall come to the questions for written reply later .
the process was , as i say , in terms of the law .
it is going to the cabinet tomorrow and will be with scof fairly shortly .
why does he even bother to waste our time by asking the question ?
nevertheless , the press has been informed that they made an error .
in that regard his voice should be far more audible .
it is his responsibility to give guidance to the police .
have the courage of your convictions for once in your life .
on this occasion the agreement was also submitted to the council .
there is an extensive list of dates of deployment of resources .
we were asked to assist and that we did .
i therefore do not think i have to reply to it .
there was a debate in the house while i was away .
when we implement this plan , we will achieve a better distribution .
he will have to apply , just like any other officials .
let me complete my description of the background .
why did it take so long for them to get together ?
do they know how many vehicles , such as buses , have been damaged in this time ?
he is not in charge of any of those forces .
they are only prepared to listen to what suits them .
let us not play politics with the lives of people .
it is very good that he knows what the law says .
it was not my first visit of such a nature .
we will now proceed to questions to the premier without notice .
the undertaking is to dispose of the questions as far as possible .
however , no grounds have yet been found for any discrimination .
we would continue to strive to improve the service to our people .
they are in the service of the province and its people .
we have not seen a plan on the table .
establishment of formal coordinated provincial structures are under discussion with stakeholders .
it said specifically that it was organised in conjunction with them .
the wording was that it was not organised by them .
and there is no black body , any black speakers ?
it was immediately recognised and the situation was contained .
we believe that the people of the province are peace-loving .
religious tolerance is necessary because religion is also an emotional issue .
i welcome them to both the provincial government and provincial parliament .
i am the premier of all the people of the western cape .
in that regard , three priorities have been identified for this year .
it was an opportunity that we grabbed with both hands .
this is almost a quarter of jobs that were created .
this has taken place three years after the adoption of the constitution .
that includes the conventional upgrading of the entire system .
the wetlands and the environment as a whole have also suffered .
unfortunately i cannot say any more on this subject at this stage .
there is no fixed tariff , that i can say now .
i said that we are currently not charging market-related rentals .
have any assets been disposed of , and how much money was raised ?
however , that we can only establish after our investigations are complete .
the judge was , however , not actually sitting at my table .
i know that it hurts a little because we are transparent .
from those figures it can be seen that we still have a long way to go .
all credit must go to health for initiating this project .
i trust that there will be a party or something else for us tonight .
i say yes , provided we start here in the department of finance .
i am sure this is about the fourth time that they have been there .
at least it is contributing towards resolving the large unemployment problem .
i think that is basically what the problem was in this regard .
this constitutional obligation will be met in various ways during the financial year .
we are grateful that this has at last been funded by the national secretariat .
i say to them , thank you very much ; keep up the good work .
last night in bonteheuwel a man and a child were shot dead again .
no , i have nothing to do with that ; go and apply there .
we need to restore the dignity , respect and honour which the police deserve .
why do they not test us on what we do have authority over ?
of course there is coordination , specifically with regard to abuse of the elderly .
sowing confusion among the people affects the people in uniform .
i shall willingly take responsibility for every aspect of my department .
she leaves as the most senior female civil servant in this province .
i want to assure him that i have the utmost appreciation for that .
all of this , however , takes place in the context of transformation on a national level .
we shall not stop fighting racism in this house .
we shall not stop fighting racism in this house .
all these schools have many sports facilities , and they happen to be white schools .
sport does not just mean a team , a field and a ball .
it also incorporates fields such as diving , sailing , hiking , gymnastics and dancing .
we need actively to market the cape as an outstanding venue for sporting events .
one issue is that this whole department should be focused on development .
a programme such as this one should not be spending so much on personnel .
sports people , soccer players and communities are all grateful for his efforts in this regard .
it is disappointing that privatisation is taking place and has taken place in the municipalities .
we make a contribution where we can , but it is exceptionally limited .
he also asked what we are doing in terms of adult participation .
i would like to congratulate them on their magnificent wins thus far .
the western cape is no exception to these global phenomena .
next time he will not get a copy of my speech .
this came as a surprise to me ; i had not expected it .
all our work is aimed at trying to achieve this joint objective .
we cannot accept it whatever reasons are given .
it is essential that we educate , protect and cherish the youth .
this is among the highest levels of expenditure in the developing world .
students arrive late for various reasons , and one of these is the transport problem .
it is acknowledged that historically this has not always been the case .
i emphasise that here and state it absolutely categorically , it is mistaken .
people do not tolerate maladministration and poor management , let alone corruption .
it is the point that we have been making all along .
the schools are taking the initiative and this makes a very big difference .
i agree with her that it is a school in crisis .
are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice ?
under the circumstances we regard this as a fair and reasonable allocation .
i must say that this is a minority of cases but it does happen .
unfortunately they are academics , and trauma is not regarded as academic .
that really has to be welcomed , certainly from our side of the house .
the result is that there is no privacy for the patients .
if that is not so , it is not good enough .
he trusted us and we failed him .
that cuts across the excitement about an increase in the budget .
this is against all the warnings that we have had .
what that report tells us is that things simply happened along the way .
we have the experts and researchers who can do a fine job .
it was in the spirit in which i learnt to know him .
i think that the budget that we are envisaging will make our hospitals better .
are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice ?
i also want to refer to the restructuring of the branch : social services .
in the western cape it was decided to have one urban and one rural project .
i do not think it is so easy to cultivate vegetables .
a disadvantage is that this project is only being financed for three years .
i would also like to give some statistics with regard to this process .
each factor will have to be analysed within the context of its sphere of influence .
in this department the emphasis needs to be placed on a certain area .
they have been given the chance , and they have shown their abilities .
proper research and the proper allocation of resources are necessary and important .
we will have to look at them as a matter of very great urgency .
sir , there is one thing that i am not at all happy about .
i hope that we will now attain peace of mind with regard to district six .
do not forget that we have a shrinking population in this province .
the same story is heard in every city , town and in this province .
the process should be used as a foundation on which to build communities .
we hope that the position will be filled as a matter of urgency .
nevertheless , i would still like to thank everyone who took part in the debate .
when he starts a speech , then i know : here come the flats .
all i can say is that i will not allow again what happened with , for example , flats in stellenbosch .
that is the advantage of belonging to a small party .
i think it can only benefit the entire community .
i must immediately add , however , that there are admittedly certain shortcomings .
there are nine vacancies , but even that might still be too few .
a working session was held with interested parties outside , including the industry .
linked to that is also the number of full-time councillors within the municipalities .
they must determine the capacity of municipalities to render a service .
at this stage , i do not foresee any officials being dismissed .
all the assets and liabilities need to go with staff and function .
let us also not give additional remuneration besides what was negotiated .
you are just repeating his whole speech ; that is all you are doing .
we drew up our legislation in line with the white paper from the national department .
that did not happen because another party suddenly arrived there .
i appreciate their candidness and what they expressed here today .
he said that too little money was being given to local government .
that is not my ruling , it is the ruling of the house .
secondly , provincial departments and selected national departments provided technical input .
the time has come for an enforceable penalty system to be brought into action .
we are sure that will come out in the court case .
later on he said that there had not been sufficient public participation .
in fact , i am thinking about staying there overnight .
it is the various disciplines which have to nominate people from those disciplines .
knowledge is power , and it gives equal access to the available resources .
we will be bringing such a case to the house after the break .
we have a very serious problem here , and it is only going to get worse .
we in the western cape pledge to speak out and change this .
i would also like to wish the department well for the year ahead .
i think enough has been said about that set definition of culture .
we must give them the opportunity to finish their speeches .
and do not become a consultant ; get away from this all !
this year we shall ensure that it is accorded the recognition it deserves .
as far as harbours are concerned , i think privatisation is probably the best option .
are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice ?
are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice ?
that is what he must explain today to the people at large .
i shall discuss this with him later when we discuss the matter again .
they sometimes need to receive credit for the work they do .
perhaps it is a good thing that we can do it this year .
the working class know well what we are talking about when we talk about poverty .
this shows what the state of the roads is in the rural areas .
the community 's initiative was , i believe , a very important one .
however , let me not encroach on the area of race .
he addressed a number of problems relating to the strategic development plan .
if people use the wrong words , it is not our fault .
we are very sorry that we have not been able to make more rapid progress in that regard .
he also referred to the number of towns where the people are struggling .
there are many people out there who will be in trouble .
let us leave them alone ; the poor people are sometimes rather late .
at the end of the day we conducted a further discussion .
i am no longer far from being finished ; i am also tired .
is there any objection to the motion being moved without notice ?
i think that that is the way the chair explained the matter .
misleading of scof and house by minister in office of the premier
we want to ensure that our ultimate choice is defensible and realistic .
at national level there is currently no clarity as to their approach .
how best can provincial property be utilised in the public interest ?
i must underline the fact that it was a very good speech .
how can we ever create an environment conducive to investment ?
i think that is something that we would like to be taken into account .
one does not need to go and look at the social effects of this .
why is there racism in the banking sector , and what is he doing about it ?
it was said that consideration would be given to membership fees and so on .
if we do depart , it will be to honour that appointment .
let us just keep the record straight on that issue .
if we do not educate people , they are not going to get jobs .
that is what we are going to do before the end of this year .
i call upon the chairperson of committees to take the chair .
i am grateful for that and proud of the agriculturists of the western cape .
show me a farm where new housing is being built for farm workers .
in the western cape we had a problem with the co-operative cellars .
however , we cannot pull the wool over everyone 's eyes .
they live in a two-roomed house with no hot water .
he is a millionaire over and over , and he wants to enjoy his money .
he has never had a problem with access to markets .
i wish to place special emphasis on extension for new farmers .
that is a word which no longer exists in my vocabulary .
let us in the western cape take the lead in this regard as well .
i appeal to the community to ask for them .
this allocation was made to build up the capacity of the standing committees .
are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice ?

and in order to do this we need to further stimulate our economy .
the western cape is no exception to these global phenomena .
urbanisation , and the resultant depopulation of the rural areas , is a worldwide trend .
unfortunately it is true that this aspect is being overlooked by certain bodies .
fifteen criminal charges were laid , and there were two attempted murders .
that is quite a high fine to impose on these people .
now tourists are unable to enter khayelitsha and spend their money there .
however , their approach to rectifying the system must be revisited .
the government must also take them seriously and listen to their grievances .
i believe that one is never too old to learn .
they seemed to be more interested in that constitution .
people have felt that the legislation is a little too harsh .
he should continue in that way and perhaps he may become a minister one day .
my intention is to go and speak to people about this kind of situation .
after my request we lost another person .
the people of all colours , political persuasions and cultures demand the death penalty .
we need an effective solution to an abnormal situation .
the police cannot protect us , why do we not admit it ?
we have all become sitting ducks for drug lords , gangsters and rapists .
we cannot allow this to become the definition of democracy .
and more and more provinces are becoming mere administrative extensions of national ministries .
this is something that one should discuss specifically in these times .
i do not have control over what is happening there .
but , no , they only see the government when their votes are needed .
we have tried to find solutions , but virtually all solutions have failed .
the moment a country uses a defence force , it overplays its hand .
i give it my full support , merely on its name .
are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice ?
i would like to take the opportunity to agree with him .
they say that it demonstrates good , clean , efficient governance .
i agree there was a call from the national government .
they will not vote for them because their days are over .
the result is that we have this kind of bill before us today .
i want to make the second point with reference to an example .
say something with some intellectual content , not rubbish and nonsense .
because there is a schedule the house will now go into committee .
if a party is not happy with it , they must vote against it .
nor is this amount for the department of housing alone .
members take that up politically by way of questions and other methods .
i think it is better for our province that we do that .
i will find out the full details and i will tell the house .
it was for one purpose , although it was spread over two financial years .
if this seems to be a razor-sharp opposition , they should try again .
it is very difficult to manage the house from here .
i ask you whether i have been in contempt of the house .
nor did i conclude such an agreement with the treasury .
in that case we cannot dispose of the third reading now .
are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice ?

this has to be acknowledged and dealt with , because it is currently a problem .
therefore the coalition government has received a reinforced political mandate from the voters .
but it is not only the highest in the advantaged communities .
yes , unemployment is lower in this province than in any other province .
it is something that is visible to the people of the province .
we are looking forward to this and we hope that this will produce good results .
such achievements by public representatives are very important and should be commended .
he has not yet occupied his post for a year or longer .
our hand must be felt , and the criminal must feel that hand .
we must convey the message of hope or else there is a problem .
all the political parties must cooperate to eradicate this evil .
if only there had been a greater focus on that during these past six years .
it is making sure that all those things happen .
i could carry on in this vein and the list just gets longer .
even i am having difficulty in hearing what she is saying .
ultimately that led to the farmer having to sell the farm .
nobody takes pleasure when things go wrong in this country .
are you saying it was a good thing that the man drove over him ?
this was the first time we became aware of them .
yes , that is the type of tourism for all that we are experiencing here .
yes , i am referring to the arms deal that has been front-page news for months .
not cheap drugs for the poor , but cheap drugs for aids .
this was the wrong time to get involved in that debate .
however , i want to make a correction and put the matter into perspective .
why did they protect the fat cats in the middle of the city ?
that is the whole purpose of further debate in the second reading .
it is very difficult to control that in any other way .
however , it is also going to depend on what the infrastructure will allow us .
i hope to get some positive input from them as well .

i wonder as i stand here whether this matter is now being politicised .
we are sitting in the house trying to politicise the situation .
that is not a true reflection of the situation .
and the schools will be closed because they have not been performing .
they have undermined the good faith of the electorate of this country .
all these events constitute a crisis in the transport system of the western cape .
how can one take seriously a government that is so slow to move ?
that is not to say that i am not going to do it .
from my part i am prepared to take certain actions .
are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice ?
are there any objections to this motion being moved without notice ?
the standing committee , in that sense , has not fulfilled its duties .
sir , we naturally take great pride in supporting this bill .
this is gratifying , since it could lead to a number of new joint projects .
i put the amendments again now that they have been read a second time .
i would therefore strongly urge against this amendment being accepted .
the changes to the draft are handwritten in pencil in my document .
i think that some of our speakers will elucidate this further in the course of the debate .
we said they could hold their caucus for as long as they wanted .
is that your only reply to what i said ?
now he proceeds to exclude this option for them .
we met for an hour and a half and asked questions .
my second remark is addressed to the other side of the house .
i am not responsible for what was done in the past .
she was not part of it , so she should hold her tongue .
that will happen if it tries to ride both horses .
she would fight jealously to protect farm workers in this province .
we have said that we do not only stand for white politics .
they will say that this has nothing to do with racism .
we were told this in the hearing at the national level .
that is why i said that there would have to be assistance .
the government of the western cape has turned a blind eye to these problems .
during the second half of the morning black businesses made submissions .
it must give money to it because it is a commercially viable enterprise .
we will lead the way in providing that type of capital .
order ! are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice ?
tell us quickly what worcester owed after you became mayor ?
that is a major concern and problem in our area .
that is not how it works , and it cannot work in that way .
what does one do about those people who do not pay tax ?
unfortunately i have to say that it has become very late in the day .
more detailed information about such a strategy will indeed be made available shortly .
we shall do so in cooperation with whoever may be necessary .
murder and violence , whatever the reason , are unacceptable .
i also wish to thank him for the assistance he offered .
we asked for a debate about attacks on farms in the province .
we must not tell them that they are farming on poor land .
are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice ?
are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice ?
or are we going to allow this matter to be properly investigated and resolved ?
there was also no information about advertising the application .
his speech made me change many of my notes .
it ought to make him feel ashamed , because he dealt with the municipality .
but those are the people who call for clean administration !
they might not have direct financial interests in his narrow sense .
will he please accept that we have serious questions on this matter ?
we have simply asked that he be removed from the board .
he is our asset , but he should be removed from the board .
it is true that one does not mix with political bedfellows .
are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice ?
i think it is unjust to send out a signal like that .
so many lives are going to be saved , and so much time .
we must punish those who are responsible .
are we simply dancing around while our people have to pay the price ?
the sorrow is not confined to individuals ; it affects all of us .
this contains the element of urgency that we cannot ignore .
it may take some time , but that will be the consequence .
one cannot negotiate on the application of the law .
i wish with all my heart that i could make that statement today .
it is our moral obligation to ensure that there is representivity .
look at the other provinces and tell me what is happening there .
of course , racist incidents such as that of the hairdresser should be condemned .
that is part of the challenge that we shall all have to tackle .
i do not wish to elaborate on what the composition was .
we also need a new starting point to the debate on race .
here was the opportunity to take it to another level .
never in all that time was my blackness ever questioned .
i am an indigenous person of no other country or continent .
let me state again for the record that i support transformation .
are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice ?
are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice ?
i wish to state bluntly that that is not the case .
all they are doing is searching for political votes for the coming elections .
by the end of the week they have no money left .
we find that racism on farms is still occurring very widely .
to a great extent the land still belongs to the white minority in the western cape .
if a farmer violates the law , i will not support him .
it creates the perception that all farmers assault farm workers and treat them badly .
we have the best administration , and we received a prize for that .
are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice ?
he also did not mention fundamental issues regarding culture .
as we know , race , class and gender are those three important categories .
the law in so far as gambling is concerned came from the national government .
that is exactly what we on this side of the house are doing .
let me tell him , they always did that kind of thing .
if it does not apply now , that was at least an admission of guilt .
he is a very fair man and he is a sensible man .
let us not use race as a means of dividing .
i thought you said you were going to talk politics .
i firmly believe that we would achieve so much more if we worked together .
we know exactly what happened when these two parties joined .
we will simply say that we are going to play cricket , rugby and soccer .
farmers continue to take on more debt and this results in bankruptcy .
just watch us , or , as they say , watch this space !
i believe that was an open process and reached everyone .
in general we worked together well , and i have to admit that .
in most municipalities here the parties could at least negotiate the matter .
criticism can also help improve and strengthen a process .
i think they let their voters down badly .
let us look at what is happening in plettenberg bay and what has happened there .

he recently made very public his belief that white people stink .
of course , the people of our province do not all have the same needs .
it is this kind of sentiment that perpetuates the divisions in our community .
the western cape government must be congratulated for their delivery to the poor .
yes , we have forgiven , but we can never forget our past .
this is what the people in the disadvantaged communities had to say .
one case of racism in our country is one case too many .
this responsibility is not being accepted precisely because there is a lack of adequate political will .
for example , the western cape has the lowest unemployment rate of all provinces .
see how quiet they are , because it is they who are the cause of this .
there are countless young people out there who are struggling with social problems .
if the youth are in a bad way , then the people are in a bad way .
one cannot bring about changes in a state of lawlessness .
when we see to it that those elements are present , they bring in integration .
it is only because of the coalition that they are now governing the province .
why have we not had that up to now in this province ?
i personally donated clothing and building material to the people of langa .
these people could certainly limit the extent of loss during fires .
this is probably because they cannot represent the community themselves .
there must be no assumption that they will not do the registration .
the people should be in a position to talk about it themselves .
when offenders are known to victims , they can be identified and caught .
he will come back and we wish him well in this objective .
secondly , the cabinet has been economical with the truth .
they made it happen in this country and in this province .
that is why i understand that they cannot speak about it .
let us in the house not regard our dreams as reality .
it is a pity , because i would like to refer to her directly .
we do not have the capacity to handle the cases .
we see that the president will now have to account for himself only once every quarter .
there are no permits and no quotas for our fishers .
if one does not use a condom , one can spread it .
we must enter into an honest dialogue with the people of the western cape .
yes , according to them , the western cape can serve as an example to other provinces .
i am sorry , but that is not a point of order .
i find that offensive and wish to distance myself from such statements .
surely this is the only yardstick by which this province can be judged ?
the history of that is gross incompetence on the part of the eastern cape .
he cannot make another speech from where he is seated .
let me dwell for a few minutes on some of these matters .
i also thank all the other chairpersons and members of standing committees .
he is the epitome of a general who leads from the front .
that is not something that was created in the last few years .
and tried to draw the police into a matter of this house .
this is to the detriment of the western cape when allocations are made from the central treasury .
now anyone who is introduced to the budgetary system immediately understands it .
we thank him for the effort , irrespective of how the dogs bark .
they have only an office here with one table and a chair .
they should not take on the role of intimidating the officials .
in the vicinity of wolseley there is a secondary school which has nine teachers .
i want to reiterate what i said last year in that same speech .
i would once again like to say that my door is open to them .
this province does not get the same amount of money as the other provinces do .
it is the ideal day to make such a stand .
they are losing thousands of people every month and they all come to the western cape .
in fact , every day should be taken seriously to eliminate racism .
it was completely out of context and not the truth .
i as the responsible minister wish to endorse this endeavour to achieve outstanding service delivery .
she did well on all the issues that she raised .
we congratulate the office on maintaining a very high standard .
to me there is a difference between the programmes and the events .
it is incumbent upon us to ensure that we achieve that vision .
i know it is hard for them to take it .
why can our local members of parliament not do that ?
i agree with that , but then we must learn , and learn fast .
it was a good speech with good content , and it was positive .
that in itself is proof that the system needs revision .
the matter of a competent authority over the building is still unresolved .
this must now come to an end. we must find a resolution .
the constitution directs us to do so .
it is time we viewed this provincial parliament in the same light .
the strategic goals i want to speak to are , and i quote :
i really feel that the coordinators are there for the whole committee .
he goes on to say very clearly , and i quote further :
he must bring us the evidence so that we can see it .
that is , however , as i say , the responsibility of local government .
as i mentioned in my reply , the project has been terminated .
i had no control over the capacity of the crowd .
however , i am sure he will be most interested in the answer .
this function belongs with the national department of water affairs and forestry .
whether it was discussed by them is not known to us .
does he support the content of that submission and subscribe to it ?
it is meant for a gathering of people elsewhere .
this is not only in the western cape , but in our country .
i am not so sure that it looks like a kennel .
farm owners are easy targets for vague and unfounded accusations of attacks .
he denied the allegations that there was a lack of transformation .
the people will yet take them to court for discriminating .
in addition , the police are continuing their investigations into the various attacks .
those are the two categories of problems that i have come up against .
when parents are the judges and the ones to take decisions , they always ask for quality .
that is precisely why i am taking it into account at this stage .
we have the capacity to handle it at the moment .
if the time for questions has expired , it is out of my hands .
i can assure you that any guilty party will be dealt with accordingly .
there has been no actual net increase in the allocation made to health .
i would also like to know when the next contract will be awarded .
you said you would be willing to find out .
he must first get his facts right before he asks such questions .
he should not expect me to know every hospital .
they may not like this , but it happens to be true .
there is no truth in it at all and i do not believe it .
i think it is only good manners to answer the question .
it has not affected the integrity or security of the examination .
school principals will be responsible for ensuring that such education takes place .
i am very proud of what we are doing .
yes , if i were the premier , i would do it again .
let us not use race as a means of dividing .
our fourth priority is to focus even more intensely on rural development .
it is also an area in which business can play an important role .
these are projects worth billions of rands , creating thousands of jobs .
this is something that the standing committee mentioned in its report .
that is a programme that is critical for the province .
i would like to congratulate them on the way the meeting was conducted .
this was a personal debate aimed at the person of the premier .
their attempts to destabilise one part of our community have failed .
we will not do what they are trying to do in the house .
we will continue to deliver to the poorest of the poor .
i believe he tells untruths to his caucus and to his children .
the razor sharp opposition that he promised has become a blunt tool .
is that the kind of service taxpayers can expect in this province ?
when matters are referred to the province , of course we will deal with them .
are figures attached to this or not , and what are those figures ?
therefore , the next question regarding the amount raised falls away .
the president himself said to us that he was very concerned .
they all expected a massive attack and opposition to the budget .
this province receives its moneys from the national treasury based on a formula .
i am upset because i believe that we have reached a low ebb .
they told us that they were investigating the problem .
and then we talk here about wasting the taxpayers ' money !
it is a complete waste of time because i have thought of everything .
and it seems we are nowhere nearer a solution .
why do we have no black policemen right on our doorstep here ?
i remember him from the days we spent together in bonteheuwel and port elizabeth .
one appreciates the fact that those people are doing two jobs .
they accuse us that we do not support transformation in the police service .
i shall certainly make a turn there and speak to the farmers .
i wish to make an earnest appeal to them to criticise us fairly , where it is right to do so .
in any event , we cannot get serious while my officials are coming in .
i have always wondered whether a honeymoon falls under the topic of recreation .
twelve local authorities have been assisted with the upgrading and development of basic sport facilities .
he must continue with the good work he is doing in that community .
the pride and commitment of those people is an example to all of us .
i therefore want to say that we need to get progress in terms of transformation .
as the party that believes in nation-building , we regard transformation as a key issue .
this is a challenge that i would like to give to our educators today .
we do not eat properly and we do not participate in sport .
where they do not pay money for grounds staff , the parents do it themselves .
i thank them for adding lustre and charm to the occasion .
we must also ensure greater access to the new tools of the global economy .
sir , urbanisation , and the resultant depopulation of the rural areas , is a worldwide trend .
after all , we are the home of the indigenous people of colour .
this brings me back to my appeal at the start of my address .
we shall have to keep more strictly to the rules in future .
that does not mean that we are satisfied merely with the basics .
the answer lies in overhauling the management of that school .
it will be very many years before we get this right .
we hope to roll out this programme in all schools without delay .
no business would be able to implement such policies and survive .
what we were indeed opposed to was the way in which the process took place .
both top-down and bottom-up strategies are necessary .
this extends from key departmental officials to school principals and educators in the classroom .
the department obviously does not understand consultation the way other people do .
choke off this early experience and learning may be stunted afterwards .
i am concerned that the standards in our schools may decline further .
we should really love to have all those facilities !
why could they not simply co-opt members until the term expired ?
she was supposed to have visited the school , but they waited in vain .
despite this , there seems to be an emerging confidence in the system .
they are just some of the many students who have achieved success .
yes , we accept that the emphasis on physical facilities was far too great .
regarding corporal punishment , i do understand the temptation to bring it back .
i do not know whether this will change if one hits them .
regarding private educational facilities , there has been a white flight from public schools .
i call on parents again to support the public system .
i shall place them on my list of schools that i must visit .
that is absolutely necessary and it is that partnership that we are trying to encourage .
we are courting disaster in an effort to stay within our budget .
i do not think that that is anything to get excited about .
he was the one who pioneered many of these issues .
it has been reported incorrectly that they are supposedly compelling children to undergo tests .
if we do not introduce the right programmes , we will never be successful .
he is a dedicated member of that committee and i thank him for that .
however , i want to refer to some of the successes in this province as well .
the interviews for the post will be conducted within the next two weeks .
this public event was used to kick-start the programme .
we still have a lot to do regarding the implementation of those rights .
here she should tell us what she is doing .
she could not submit any plans , not even any ideas .
it is an ongoing process and i think that it is very important .
i think it is quite critical to do that as soon as possible .
with home-ownership come certain responsibilities , especially financial responsibilities that must be met .
if order is not maintained in this house , we will enforce it .
after today , the house will have , i hope , understanding for the problems we are grappling with .
i thank them for their hard work and their contribution in that regard .
the reasons for this influx have been mentioned many times previously in this house .
what about the spread of venereal diseases where people have to use a communal toilet ?
the money for the upgrading of those units was made available years ago .
we are provisionally withholding our provincial legislation until a national framework has been drawn up .
i now come to the next and last point .
this is very important , and the one we might just miss .
the next challenge we will put to them concerns the number of councillors .
the staff are going to be transferred in accordance with the provisions of the labour relations act .
as the functions are moved , the staff simply have to move with those functions .
i hope that this will be a serious matter for each of us here .
about three weeks ago this programme was stopped and it is now being reformed .
that would also mean that we could get going with transformation .
how can we continue with transformation if the legislation is not there ?
i know that that is terribly difficult , because politics controls our lives , our everything .
obviously , at the end of the day government is linked to politics .
i think that is the important point that we have to keep in mind .
it is true that the fire services are not accessible in certain areas .
the solution to our problems lies in cooperation , in looking for answers together .
i made a request earlier that they should not do so .
if that amendment were agreed to , i think we could support it .
should the departments of local government and of development planning not be together ?
i hope that he is not about to leave .
it is therefore not just that there are no professionals available .
it was a painful exercise and it was difficult to understand at times .
in any case , it is not for cabinet to take a decision .
it was not my intention to read this out here today .
i will spend some time with her , specifically on this matter .
i believe that they are doing an excellent job and i have their fullest cooperation .
then we have another example , namely " die vriende van die stellenbosch museum " .
at present there is no solution ; deadlock has been reached .
i shall make sure that it happens during my term of office in this portfolio .
why did he not have the courage to carry it through ?
we look forward to supporting them in the year ahead .
in their wisdom they decided to stop the initial decision .
it is always a pleasure to work with people like them .
in cape town alone there are more than a million outstanding fines .
so that they can feel what it is like to travel on those roads .
the system works very well and has proven itself in many other countries .
i believe it is wrong , and they know it is wrong !
let me turn now to what i would like to highlight in the house today .
extremely hard work has been put into the drafting of the strategic development plan .
we really do not want to see christmas trees on the roads every day .
we cannot provide parking to everyone who is entitled to it .
this was the question to me that he put on the question paper .
i think it is high time that we start thinking of the future .
this is not as a result of what the national minister has done .
we should not make promises to the voters that cannot be realised .
wherever we are able to address the needs of our people , we do so .
agricultural products are cultivated on the mountain , and they must be transported on that road .
i may just add that we do have a problem in one respect .
i had wished to do so earlier , but unfortunately i forgot to do so .
secondly , competition is not only based on price , but increasingly on quality .
we hope to finalise the legislation by the end of the year .
programmes to achieve this are being designed in conjunction with local tertiary institutions .
this will assist us greatly with the effective management and administration of rental and lease agreements .
i think this is a great challenge for the province and the cabinet .
however , i will fight that battle elsewhere , and i will continue to fight it .
is the vision acceptable to a broad range of interests , and does it give hope ?
you can take a horse to water but you cannot make him drink .
it is that joint emphasis which i think is absolutely critical .
let me just remind him of what that was all about ; he may have forgotten .
the problem with the system is the problem i explained earlier . [ interjections .
he must just report it to me , and i will gladly do it .
i do not smoke , but i love my country and its people .
the other countries to which we export also impose levies on those products .
when one takes into account the profitability of farming , this is unjust .
this would enable agriculture to be competitive in world markets .
these are the cries that are as relevant today as they were before .
the workers themselves want to see that something more positive is being done for them .
in earlier years all the workers in the western cape were paid on the same scale .
i do not think that they are really interested , because they simply want to criticise .
let us look at the roads that the farmers use .
i believe that in this regard the success of the police should be mentioned .
we shall have to work on these people in order to convert them .
the town is too far and how is she to get there ?
he has really never had difficulty paying for their training .
it was not allocated to parties to employ secretaries .
we must also ensure greater access to the new tools of the global economy .
after all , we are the home of the indigenous people of colour .
this brings me back to my appeal at the start of my address .
it is nearly three years now , with nothing to show for it .
no solution can be realised via the path of conflict .
can we allow ourselves to be held ransom by these thugs ?
somebody here said that the ranks should not be closed .
sir , i move that the bill be read a second time .
the roll is too long to read , and it is growing daily .
while we are meeting here , another family is making funeral arrangements .
our people on the cape flats in particular need an answer .
how many lives must we still lose before we do the right thing ?
there is absolutely no doubt about that , and one must concur with it .
at the same time the integrity of the police and how it is perceived must be reinforced .
sometimes we wish to ascribe it to a new government and a black government .
studies show a direct correlation between poverty and social evils within society .
i never said that my hands were tied ; other people say that .
included in the act on how this should be tackled .
if anyone phones him at home , he has to go and investigate the crime .
the fact of the matter is that his cabinet does not support him .
we should use the religious order people or , alternatively , the teaching profession .
it is something we have not experienced for a long time , but i cannot allow it .
standing committee on health , social services , office of the premier and corporate services :
therefore , if there are no objections it can be dealt with now .
we hope that as the debate gets hotter , the house will become cooler .
he goes on a little later to say , and i quote :
he has all the correspondence but he uses what suits him .
the question before the house today is the approval of that unauthorised expenditure .
they are only realising that now that i am telling them how to do it .
however , they cannot do anything about it now ; it is too late .
how it was expended and how many officials were given compensation from that amount of money ?
would the leader of the house like to address the chair on this matter ?
the leader of the house may have an opportunity to speak to this .
i will try to keep a check that three questions per member are put .
that is part of the white book for the administration of the department .
if one reads carefully , one will notice that planning is also involved .
they were not in a position to give me the final details before this session .
obviously , we are not getting any assistance from that side of the house .
i have allowed everyone to make short statements and ask questions .
we had a brief discussion , as he was in a meeting .
i furnished answers to the house that i just wish to explain .
that is a public statement , as are answers to public questions and other means .
it is a battle which we cannot afford to lose .
if this government had only been able to deal more effectively with the matter earlier on !
sir , i am not going to elaborate at length on the role of the scorpions .
farm workers make a very important contribution to the economy of the province .
this statement by the minister does not serve the case of the workers .
it is the poverty and lack of jobs for coloured and african communities .
finally , the fifth priority is the drive to clean up our province .
this message will have to be driven by each one of us in the house .
it breaks down many of the divisions that we have in our society .
but that they be given a real say in the decisions that affect their lives .
the fact of the matter is they received a thrashing .
lack of confidence in the national government is an impediment to such growth .
it contained a number of substantive pronouncements and other initiatives .
i am not on the side of people who break the law .
we believe that this amount will provide a financial injection into the region .
last year a debate was requested in this house on attacks on farm workers .
it is correct that the man drove over him in a light vehicle .
we know that there are exceptions and we know that these may be isolated cases .
there is something called inflation in the rand ; you should know it .
in the coming year our team will commence new treatments in khayelitsha .
we cannot help protect profit margins at the expense of human lives .
after the production the audience was invited to comment .
we will care where we need to care for people in this province .
so , even there it is not a direct link with the company .
it does seem as if there is light at the end of the tunnel .
i unfortunately do not read about it in the newspapers ; i live that life .
we are not reading newspapers ; we cannot rely on the newspapers .
the provincial commissioner , despite certain efforts , is doing an outstanding job of work .
it is an outstanding job of work with the limited amount of capacity that he has .
the industry will be assisted in training and the formation of a provincial cooperation .
he does not know what he is talking about and that is why he opens his mouth .
i absolutely object to the abuse of the rules of the house .
it is nice to say things in the heat of the moment .
the inputs by the standing committee could possibly bring us to a solution .
he notified me that he could not be present .
we are not ashamed to say that we are on this side .
if that is not a direct conflict of interests , i do not know .
i would like to know who is who in this large mesh of people .
she clearly knows that the intention was that we were referring to the western cape .
we have a number of directors on our board who are there for their expertise .
i have tried to answer the issues raised comprehensively .
this bill , in effect , does not apply to the other shareholders .
this is a repetition of what appears in the national constitution .
they have a premier who says who will do what in the cabinet .
he went home and hid in his mother 's house .
i said he told a lie about the standing committee .
the executive and legislative authority of a municipality is vested in its municipal council .
legitimacy means the highest acceptance by the widest possible cross-section of the community .
this is of course a situation that we can never tolerate and understand .
they failed to understand the plight of those people .
criticising is not impinging upon that independence .
it seems as if this is a sore point and will be for a long time .
why did we join the labour party and work for that party at the time ?
with this vangardism , they represent nobody .
they are trying to undermine any competition through this scurrilous suspicion-mongering .
what is happening because of this lack of access to finance on the part of black businesses ?
that is why we say that this problem goes a great deal further than one population group .
we heard one story after the other , all with the same trend .
they are entirely financially viable now , but it stands against their creditworthiness .
and unlawful occupations in many areas , which were also fomented by that party .
yes , it is , because we are committed to making it work .
they need money , yes , but they need two other things as well .
not only did people pay rates , they paid rates without representation .
it is because they are not running local government and local councils efficiently .
i must say that a rather superficial debate is being conducted here .
what we are clearly saying to one another is that people have to pay for services .
it is very difficult for me from where i am sitting to deal with this .
i want to mention the figures relating to what happened in the specific areas .
the other stumbling block is the prevention of the violence that is taking place on farms .
tragically , the western cape has a very long history of the exploitation of farm workers .
this exploitation finds expression in the poor living conditions , low wages and so on .
i think it is extremely relevant and the house should take cognisance of this .
when we look at the national situation , the figure is really unacceptably high .
they are driving a wedge between farm workers and farmers .
these criminals are occupying the rural areas with their criminal actions .
in so far as the contents overlap , the chair will take a final decision on it .
i was just considering whether i had to make any disclosure in that regard .
that is why we have been forced to bring the motion today .
all the allegations were put in writing but nothing was really done .
they say in this sleazy report of theirs that i am trying to cover up things .
when i get the report it will of course be given to the commission .
those are the issues that raise our suspicions and questions .
we had a point of order on this issue the other day .
why would somebody put something in a tree and nobody see him ?
i wish to repeat and elucidate further the point i made earlier .
they must be fought with passion , belief , dedication and appropriate and necessary means .
he finds that there is a total onslaught on democracy .
i would like to share the contents of the letter with the house today .
i believe the minister has gone much further than this simple description .
to illustrate the cooperation , i wish to place the following on record .
black people as an ethnic group are not directly represented on this cabinet .
and then he sent the pamphlet which is supposed to be printed .
however , i also wish to remind him that there is such a thing as morality .
they think it creates a certain impression about how farmers treat their workers .
it deals with the human dignity of people in the western cape , farm workers and farmers .
when they questioned their wages , they were summarily dismissed from the farm .
farmers have been blamed for much of the violence perpetrated on workers .
the process of negotiation is under way and the code of conduct will be signed shortly .
nevertheless the matter is raised here today as if there has already been a conviction .
that the representation in the board be considered regarding the different categories of organisations .
perhaps then we would not have had what we had yesterday .
the fact is that no facts could be presented to us yesterday .
this was achieved due to better financial planning and greater and improved fiscal discipline .
it is our constitutional obligation to make sure that each citizen is protected .
if they want to learn about our culture they should come to us .
it is one thing to talk about development , but at what price ?
let us look at what has happened in the western cape within one year .
it speaks to reaching out across the tracks of division , racial and economic .
fifty-eight per cent of the coloureds did not vote for them .
they are very concerned about this growing giant .
there is therefore no dispute about why the opening of our parliament took place on tuesday .
very well , i take my words back , but my opinion has not changed .
infrastructure is falling apart and service delivery no longer offers value for money .
this government has a history of having ideas without any plans .
he said that he would continue evicting the workers .
let me refer to the problems , the crisis in agriculture in the western cape .
whatever they do , the results prove that they are sitting on the tail .
and yet , time after time , they point their fingers at this side of the house .
we came here to create a better province for our people .
i warn him to take care that they do not poison him .
i hope that the suggestions made by her will be seriously considered .
i want to stress this : they advise parents , they do not insist on it .
i want to thank him for bringing level-headedness and realism back to education .
the amending act , which has not yet been proclaimed , does not go far enough .
he cheerfully blames the national government and talks about a shortage of powers .
yes , we do come from an environment of acute discrimination , humiliation , frustration and conflict .
she is now appointing her own committee as the governing body of that school .
they whinge on and on about racism but then , in the same breath , make themselves guilty of it .
secondly , it means saying the same things in the simplest of language .
to go from victory to victory in one election after the other .
if four people are killed in bonteheuwel he will not be there .
just go back and see what the trend in the community is .
does he think for one moment that that person is going to allow himself to be bullied by anyone ?
he was far-seeing enough to say that we should continue with this process .
in societies where unemployment is rife , the level of crime is very low .
they were unable to answer the questions on finance .
they do not ask whether one is white or black or brown .
decent values ask whether one can act in a decent and civilised manner towards one 's fellow human being .
yes , i am afraid that that is something that we cannot get away from .
any person who says anything to the contrary to this house is a liar .
let us rather be honest and admit that racists are encountered in all communities .
on the contrary , it is increasing and the situation is becoming serious , in this province too .
we are committed to making morality and integrity real in politics .
i want to do something that brings about a real improvement in the conditions of our people in agriculture .
i ask him not to continue his running commentary .
we have attempted to align provincial with national fiscal policy .
i hope that i shall not be speaking for more than four minutes .
the committee notes with concern the lack of funds for school sports .
on both occasions she came with very little backup to the committee .
sadly , he clearly has very little understanding of the meaning of the word .
the companies come together and the forces are brought in from that side .
that is besides the five primary schools in and around wolseley .
what i am dealing with is not this year 's budget , but the principle .
i thought to myself : if only he would sit down now !
i venture to suggest that they would all be up in arms .
i would like to listen to his motion tomorrow and give it consideration .
we hear firsthand what their problems are and how we should address them .
man should never be guilty of violence or abuse against women .
obviously , if it benefits our province , we will do this .
i want to commend him on a difficult job reasonably well done .
let me repeat my plea to people to choose their words .
it would therefore not make economic sense to decentralise this function .
therefore , it is not possible to prove ownership beyond reasonable doubt .
the ongoing crisis in this respect can severely retard our operation as a parliament .
i also propose that there should be a time-frame in the action plan .
poverty is not a morally neutral phenomenon which merely needs to be understood .
why can we not get up here today and say things are shifting ?
it is quite simple , but clearly there is a problem of political will .
but then again it is part of a coalition , and the same kind of coalition .
the last sentence of this letter is of relevance , and i quote :
as he correctly remarked , we only have a few people in our employ .
i was watching , and i think they acted like a bunch of hyenas .
we have not spent it yet because we are working out the plan .
i said no , because there was no point of order there .
i shall get it for her , and then she will know the facts .
that gives me hope that perhaps something will come from all the talk .
the committee notes with concern the lack of funds for school sports .
in fact , that is precisely how the matter is treated at the national parliament .
in this connection i will take up the matter with the various political parties .
i want to state quite unequivocally that , without this , our parliamentary autonomy is a myth .
an utter imbalance in workload has come about , and it has to be rectified .
i think we have all acquired substantial experience of this over recent years .
once this is done , it is able to deliver a service to its clientele .
we will certainly look at the rules so that we can further implement this .
we have said that they can monitor it themselves and look at what happens there .
i cannot understand what that has to do with the matter .
why did he not then write to the newspaper and clarify that ?
it is a well-known fact that cape town itself has no more land .
my department will , however , give its full support and cooperation to the commission .
i know this is not a large sum , but every bit helps .
once i see it categorically in writing , i will reply to it .
i would suggest that he takes that into account .
it was not simply an issue of the district council doing so .
this complicates matters for the security personnel always to recognise members of parliament immediately .
worst of all is the type of racism we see here .
when there was a problem , they dealt with it and showed leadership .
but there was another part of the question that i missed .
i regret that the time for questions for oral reply has expired .
however , i am aware of numerous unsubstantiated allegations of discrimination against black workers .
that a large portion of the budget was ring-fenced for capital expenditure .
how many people who wait for grants each month apply for social relief ?
the interim contract is fully funded by the national department of transport .
it means that the province should act as if they were paying this money themselves .
they did not achieve that , because scof made a recommendation on it .
the act does not provide that they should wait for regulations .
i have been in communication with the national minister of health on this issue .
figures on disability are currently not very reliable for the following reasons :
so , it is big of him to ask me that question .
our vision is also of a province in which every citizen truly feels at home .
again , when this government makes a promise , it keeps that promise .
we know that everyone is in a hurry with the programmes and projects that they are proposing .
we can do nothing about this , because we have to develop and to create jobs .
we know very little about it and we would like to see it being utilised .
the strength of our unity lies in the strength of our provincial pride .
i believe that the registration of voters is the right thing to do .
that is not the spirit in which i opened the debate on tuesday .
it is their decision and the people will judge them by that decision .
i pointed out some matters in that respect in my letter to you .
the eventuality which has arisen now is the proposed motion of no confidence .
there must , of course , be additional pumps , and there are now four pumps available .
he had certain information that was not made available to me .
he should have looked at it , because he knows what the situation is there .
i cannot profess to detailed knowledge of that up front .
it has transpired , however , that ongoing maintenance of the relevant houses has been undertaken .
up till now i have not met with him again .
what is the use of liberty if economic restitution fails to present itself ?
i hope that this proposal receives the support of all parties in the house .
we can indeed say that there is a wind of change blowing .
they have been able to work with officials of the national government and master the national direction .
we all know where we are coming from with this department of finance .
i believe he came to parliament because he heard voices !
unfortunately , and this is my gripe , the provincial government was not informed about it .
we should congratulate them on their efforts and the marked improvement that has taken place .
but there are members whose whereabouts one has no idea of .
he should try to give his ears a better chance than his mouth .
we should be using people outside to assist us in matters such as this .
they have achieved something , and i congratulate them on what they have achieved .
in this regard we must also place the provincial perspective in the national context .
the public will only volunteer information to officers they know , trust and have confidence in .
i call to mind what we have before us here , namely the firearms bill .
the national government has promised us all sorts of plans to stamp out crime .
there is no doubt that we need to find ways of funding it .
we would like to know how we as political parties can take part in that programme .
they have no protection for their families , should they leave the service .
i say that it has been upgraded because he now deals directly with the ministry .
the fact of the matter is , however , that the people are not dumb .
i am particularly concerned that they have once again started this debate .
it is no problem to attack me personally ; i can take that .
he should not shake his head ; he does not know what it is all about .
for a small department with a small budget , the output is extremely high indeed .
they get very little credit and no recognition is given for outstanding service .
there is no indication at all in terms of money being given to this code .
we need to utilise sports stars , such as national teams coming to play in cape town .
i trust that more funds will be channelled in this direction in the future .
my thanks go to all the fine young people that participated this morning .
but this does not mean we must sit back and become complacent .
i appeal to the media not to ignore the positive .
i am determined to rid our homes for the aged of the bad apples .
moreover , the number of tourists and visitors to the western cape was disappointing for some businesses .
political freedom means nothing without a good balance between social and economic freedom .
together we can continue to make this a better province , country and continent .
our policy is not to throw good money after bad money .
more and more learners are coming from the eastern cape because they want a good education .
they try to implement innovations that are beyond their ability to carry out .
i have been speaking about what i think educational change should be .
she went to the school to find out why it had happened .
this school has a committed headmaster and staff , and it shows .
for example , let us go and talk to the management body of the beacon hill secondary school .
there is no doubt that there are deteriorating moral standards in the schools .
yesterday we heard once again the appeal for more sports facilities for schools .
in a great many schools there are a great many very needy children , and considerable dissatisfaction prevails .
some have argued that we have tried to change too much at the same time .
i fully support the goals and objectives outlined by the department .
if that is impossible , we have an entire system that can look after them .
i also want to thank everyone concerned about and acting against this scourge .
the data can be collected in the region and transferred electronically to the research centre .
these are but some of the questions that people with disabilities are asking .
i can see that he has done a lot of research , and i congratulate him .
abraham suffered from sugar diabetes and had his one leg amputated two years ago .
if national policies do not make provision for this , we should develop our own policies .
we agree with him that we cannot allow it to continue .
what he did here was definitely not in the interests of health .
they are engaged in another project relating to the behaviour of children at school .
they need upgrading , without doubt , and we are looking into that .
i will send her the reply that i sent to that doctor .
this was an unavoidable step that we had to take to bring down our numbers .
this is a new programme , which explains in part the increase under the item personnel .
they are representative of everyone in that area , including political parties .
i would like to approach this debate in what might be a different way .
just giving money to them is clearly not good enough .
however , i think we have moved well beyond some of those issues .
the other court case , in connection with the post office , will start tomorrow and carry on the next day .
some of these stalwarts also received recognition of their zeal and enthusiasm .
this is bad news for the western cape , especially for the economy of the western cape .
those people are being exploited terribly and they have no recourse against the landlords .
i thought that when we were finished , we would go over to an integrated waiting list .
across the length and breadth of the western cape , there is a shortage of housing .
in cape town , george , worcester and all over our province there are homeless people .
the people of delft have been complaining about the allocation of people to these houses .
i trust that it will now be possible effectively to finalise the process in the communities .
cape town , which was once a lively city , especially on saturday mornings , is now as dead as a dodo .
the money simply is not enough to give each person a dwelling .
it was the order of the day for the community to be consulted .
we are achieving this by way of regular discussions with our municipalities .
the first aspect that we should look at is the legislation in terms of which we work .
there is therefore a major challenge facing us as far as the registration of voters is concerned .
to do that , i need the advice of the people on the ground .
we have to be realistic and recognise that the name is known nationally and internationally .
we have not yet received money and neither has any municipality .
the councillors and officials of the municipalities in the western cape have adjusted very well .
here we have a department who knows where they are coming from and where they are going to .
even within our province we have vastly different needs , levels of development and capacity .
we must help build capacity , so that the services can ultimately be rendered .
funds for the eradication of poverty are not reflected on our budget either .
i think it is a difficult process , but i believe we are almost there .
that is the question , and it has definitive implications for the coming local government .
what happened was that the municipalities could not get their financial statements in order .
that council had the courage to look after the poor people .
we all know that certain informal areas are not accessible to fire engines .
i have a task to perform and a job to do .
i therefore do not think it is in principle a move away from that .
even today , my political party asked me why i made that decision .
it can be a highly emotive issue , and has been considered to be that thus far .
a number of aspects are covered in this act , as well as in the planning act .
i am very pleased to see that note has been taken by the opposition .
our original advertisement was not to attract people from the general public .
all kinds of questions spring to my mind when we talk about the performing arts .
i am glad to see that there is an increase in this regard .
we are dealing with the environment at the moment and not with planning .
it was good to see our people remained faithful to a culture .
our courts , health services , social services and education must ensure that these principles are adhered to .
i believe there is a fine line between culture , police services , sports and recreation .
those activities are part of the political process and political debate of the past .
according to our rules , the bill will now be referred to the relevant standing committee .
as the responsible minister my appeal is that this province must not neglect its heritage .
i wish to thank him for his cooperation and contribution to transport in this province .
i would like to express my disappointment and concern on this issue in the house today .
sir , another point i should like to single out is the funding of roads .
he has thus once again said nothing with reference to that particular programme .
we should be far more flexible in our approach to issues like this .
as far as the accommodation to which he referred is concerned , we shall not carry on in this way .
this will mean that we shall be able to finalise this road with one contract .
let us decide that if political will is needed , it must be used .
we shall do everything we can to maintain the roads .
often the secretariat have to edit motions further from an administrative and language point of view .
it has to be dropped across the entire globe within a matter of six months .
one has to gain acceptance for one 's products from civil society or disappear .
increasingly companies are putting that asset on their balance sheets because it is their most valuable asset .
it is going to be very difficult and i think our collective wisdom will be necessary .
numerous studies have been done on this ; we will identify the information and make it available .
these offices are situated in ceres , saldanha , caledon , bredasdorp , riversdale , beaufort west , george and heideveld .
there has been tremendous progress this year and it is in place for next year .
there is no way in which we are going to convince them to come here .
if there is anything that we can do there we would like to do so .
in fact , we could have a long sit down and then i will tell him all about it .
he was not here the day i read out the reply .
when we get them , we take them up strongly and vociferously with the board without pulling punches .
it is a matter of importance to us that new agriculturists be successfully established .
it is the story of ordinary people , of their love , faith , hope and sorrow .
he spoke as if he had begun to understand what agriculture in the western cape was about .
it is a noble step forward , that is done with so much wisdom and vision .
as we know , there are those who are difficult to convert .
her parents had to get up early and return home late from work .
the coming of the rain is to her like a death sentence .
there is no time to rest , however tired her body may be .
i said in my budget address that agriculture was prepared to reach out .
they put him there in the first place to be on transformation .
i am going to start from the beginning and remind the house of the voting thus far .
my thanks go to all the fine young people that participated this morning .
but this does not mean we must sit back and become complacent .
i appeal to the media not to ignore the positive .
i am determined to rid our homes for the aged of the bad apples .
moreover , the number of tourists and visitors to the western cape was disappointing for some businesses .
political freedom means nothing without a good balance between social and economic freedom .
together we can continue to make this a better province , country and continent .
it would have been better if we had had the bill before the crisis .
he should remember what he has done and the mess he has made .
we are living in a democratic society , and we must respect the rights of others .
there is something else behind it , something we cannot get to .
he said that if that ever happens it must be stopped .
he gave the amendment more muscle than what we originally thought of .
i could not attend his funeral because i had another appointment .
the life on the cape flats does not concern them , it is meaningless , it is not precious .
they are as unwelcome as foreign hostile forces are and should be treated as such .
if the current trends continues , provincial government will become less and less relevant .
the fight against crime will have to become a municipal competency , and we must prepare for that .
the constitution stipulates that if you kill you shall not be killed .
because gangs protect their members better than what the police can protect law-abiding citizens .
indeed , these children are suffering deprivation , inadequate education and so on .
i accuse church people and ask what has happened to the voice of the church .
if we do not use that as a yardstick against crime then we have failed .
i have no problem with many of the clauses in the national constitution .
they have more than their fair share of vehicles in relation to other stations .
in fact , we are operating in a very strange house here today .
we must at all times strive to make things easier for ourselves .
it is the genuine fear , and that is why we have had this reaction .
does this mean that we must also call in the independent electoral commission to come and be accountable ?
it should not be a case of putting a further question in writing .
any spare money could have been used to assist in such a problem .
the request was made to the standing committee i think in december last year .
was that not a spurious argument , if teachers were in fact taken out of classrooms ?
who precisely were these officials in the office of the premier who were deployed ?
he is now authorising this ; he still has the chance to save his programmes .
i have made the assumption that it came from the budget for overtime .
posts may be filled or not filled , and there may be savings .
i can assure him that i am settling in quite well and at a fast pace .
it is a crying shame , given the extent and the impact of this problem .
in any event , what he had to say about it is nothing new .
with the necessary support and assistance they will make a success of such opportunities .
that is a judgment on the their government by the constitutional court of this country .
these pushers are preying on kids as young as seven and eight years old .
but would he please see to it that the mayor of plettenberg bay gets this message , too ?
it is not part of our humanity for us to be able to do that .
instead , there is a great deal of joy over how great we are !
guess who was not there when all the other ministers of health were there ?
again , the issue is whether consultation did or did not take place in that community .
failure to do so will result in further unemployment and poverty .
when his doctor declared him medically unfit , he too had to leave the farm .
in actual fact , i made sure i congratulated him a week before his birthday .
many of them will be dead by the time these jobs materialise .
men and women have begun to insist on practising sex freely without condoms .
unfortunately it became the epitome of reactionary criticism and a lack of vision .
i have pleasure in tabling the report as follows :
the money allocated for olympic projects has also been rolled over repeatedly .
no decision has yet been made as to where the savings can be utilised .
nevertheless they tried to show that the coalition is interested in what is happening out there .
i have been sitting here wondering what he is talking about , because there is a policy .
we have inherited political decisions which were implemented , and this has to be resolved politically .
we are carrying on telling stories here as though we are taking part in a drama .
i will not go into any detail other than what is publicly known .
they are not sure who is in charge of transport in the province .
they are nowhere near where people 's lives could be endangered .
this is not a light moment at which we can simply let things pass .
if people die , their blood will be on the hands of everyone sitting here .
the people who applied and who qualified obtained their permits .
he does not live there , he does not know how the people there feel .
when we are talking about international attendance , the economic impact from conventions is even higher .
i appeal to all to participate positively .
the province is now moving into its second phase of evolution as a destination for tourism .
of critical importance , however , is that one needs the expertise of people in this regard .
we can purchase shares , and that is indeed what we are doing in this arrangement .
he cost the company a lot of money to employ .
those people bring excellent expertise and expertise is not dependent on colour .
this house will in any case have to approve any contribution that is going to be budgeted for .
these were the amendments that we made while we were discussing the bill .
the motivation as to why there should be this deletion is based on the original text .
we are not asking the house to approve anything other than this .
perhaps i should first just say what is intended by a kind of municipality .
there is nothing to stop them from coming back with an amendment .
we therefore have no hesitation in supporting the principles of this bill .
however , when it comes to the detail we have serious problems with the bill .
to base one 's whole argument on the past is totally wrong .
i believe that not even the judiciary should be above criticism .
the three of us were among the first people who put up a fight for the coloured people at the time .
in the first instance we joined the labour party to destroy apartheid .
for that reason they will never be trusted , as long as we live .
these are the obstacles that face black businesses in this country today .
we cannot expect the banks to simply hand over money .
these allegations of racism in banking are but one side of the coin .
from what we have said , it is clear that those cases are coming forward .
i told my colleague that he was actually not entirely correct factually .
it is not my line function responsibility , but this government is , in fact , committed .
it may be that the rates they were paying previously were artificially low .
it was a negative growth rate , but at least we now have a positive growth rate .
the voters are now rebelling and asking why services are not being provided .
if these pillars are tampered with , it could do endless harm to our economy .
recent times have shown that agriculture in the western cape is experiencing very difficult times .
this is not really a case of politics , particularly in the western cape .
it is all very well to speak about murder and violence on farms .
any request for the house to observe a minute 's silence is effectively a motion .
assets must be protected to ensure stability and prosperity in the rural environment .
if he referred to anybody in the house , he will have to withdraw it .
i therefore request you to consider my view before giving a ruling .
the employee can do nothing to influence the outcome of the event .
this week we read in the newspapers about the corruption in the traffic services .
in this particular instance the allegation is that there was a discussion on hotels .
they are people with experience who are prepared to put their time into this .
as chairperson i dealt with the agenda absolutely in accordance with the matters on the agenda .
however , it was said that these people were simply chatting among themselves .
we should move closer to that , and the members of this house must speak unambiguously today .
at that stage the terrorists were the people who fought for the right , justice and human dignity .
they must do their job and we must all support them where we can .
this is the basic responsibility of all government and one we take seriously .
we can sit in this house and pretend that that reality does not exist .
in contrast , they have far too many white africans in relation to their support base .
were they not too white before and too black today ?
the debate on race in the western cape has been about relationships between coloureds and africans .
the fact is that there was an abnormal situation and we have to concede that .
yes , very well , that is the truth , but to some extent that could be politics .
is this not the racism on farms that we refer to every day ?
they are imposing a code of conduct between farm workers and their employers .
and about the accumulation of unanswered requests to which we have not yet had any reply .
that is not a point of order on which the chair needs to rule .
i believe he conducted himself in a most professional and competent manner .
i only serve as the chairperson , and i occupied a very neutral position .
everyone wanted to do what he or she wanted to do , at the expense of the taxpayer .
aligned to this i undertook to improve the efficiency of financial administration .
he should spend his time there and look at his dictionary more often .
according to the rules , the bill will now be referred to the relevant standing committee .
another fundamental issue that i want to raise today is the question of poverty .
one goes to a household and consults with the members of that household .
this is the eighth year that many of us have been in government .
all this province is in fact doing is carrying out its obligations .
i could go on , but i will not bore the house with the details .
i venture to suggest that this is the start of it all .
we saw it in the elections here at the end of last year .
it is ordinary voters who are voting with their feet and staying away at the polls .
when they talk to us about it , it is as if it is a normal occurrence .
it is the newspaper i quoted from earlier on that is lying on my desk .
i also want to congratulate him on the positive initiatives that he announced .
they then had to adapt their strategy and they used racism effectively this time round .
they had to design the correct tactic which would scare the hell out of white voters .
i wonder how many of us today have the conviction to say this .
what they intended to do , they have succeeded in doing .
they do not see them for five years ; they are never there .
it is clear that he , as a dominee , has not yet seen the light .
he would have done much better if he had simply kept quiet on the subject .
we must stand united in our diversity in this province and in our country .
we are glad that our government is doing and wants to do something about the aged .
they would accept the responsibility , but only if they got full capacity and responsibility .
not that this statistic means that we can rest on our laurels .
it is on this pillar that the social fabric of a community is moulded .
a young population with low morality leads to a nation with low moral values .
if they measure us against that , they will not find us wanting .
one cannot turn a blind eye when people are dying .
we need to correct that , and then we can continue with the debate on security .
these are tangible benefits that will bring to the people a better quality of life .
firstly , i would like to refer to children and the protection of their rights .
she is selective in that she chooses her programme and her organisations that she works with .
if only she ran her office the way she talks in the house !
they should go back to them and they will return with a totally new attitude .
there were open and positive responses to the questions put by the community .
i think it was a great success and it was widely reported on .
if one has one or two unhappy people , one listens to them .
do they really care about poverty and about the people in the community ?
the fact that he insulted that person here today is a humiliation of this house .
our people are losing confidence in those who are caught for drunken driving .
crime is crippling this province and everyone is suffering as a result .
we must take action to stop the vicious circle before it is too late .
we , as public representatives , are obligated to lead by example .
that does not mean that we are arguing that every single person wants to do that .
for a whole week they worked without pay on the road of death .
do they not remember that they are actually the architects of racism and apartheid ?
he might even have misheard or it might have been someone outside .
this is also a valuable opportunity to link our patients to available resources .
a comprehensive and imaginative plan has been developed and will soon be implemented .
no , according to him and his minister , farm people in this province are treated very well .
the only object of concern is the farmer on his farm , with his family and his dog .
i committed myself to constructive cooperation with everyone who wanted to uplift my people .
it is right that there should be legislation creating security for the workers .
to contribute to the creation of a safer environment for our people .
we all agree with the idea of creating a safe environment .
the dogs bark when the caravan leaves and they bark when the caravan comes back .
it is not easy , but that is what political will requires of us .
every building and road that was built , all the infrastructure , everything was obviously wrong .
i want to thank that side of the house for accepting the budget .
i am proud to be the leader and part of a disciplined party .
last year provided an unique opportunity to build capacity in this regard .
i do not count the session of last year , the one after the election .
money has been made available for campaigns , but exact amounts could not be specified .
if it is not guided by our need , it does not make any difference .
they can carry on like that , but there are others who want to listen to what is being said .
this sort of thing creates the perception that we do not know what we are talking about .
the standing committee is an extension of the house to which the budget is referred .
i wish to say to them that their good work has not gone unnoticed .
there will be no possibility of expansion if they do not join hands with us .
when one looks at the budget of the departments , all posts are important .
there have always been excuses in the past , such as lack of capacity and funds .
that service can be implemented immediately and the standing committees will function more effectively .
it is very clear that there is a high degree of unanimity and cooperation .
i have said before in the house and i will say it again .
i said expressly that no money had been spent at this stage .
we believe that that will be a more appropriate day on which to make such a statement .
the tabling of the report should , i think , have been done within a shorter period .
i am not asking whether the process was followed in terms of the law .
i specifically asked whether he could describe the process within the public service itself .
however , that course of action would have meant greater problems in the implementation of any system at all .
therefore , according to the rules i cannot allow further time for these questions .
it was the best festival in the six years that it has been held .
no decision was taken to prosecute or not , as far as is known .
this was done by the national department of environmental affairs and tourism and international consultants .
they are caught up in work that they are not supposed to be doing .
each one has its own dynamics and in some that is a very strong dynamic .
that is the opinion we received last week from a senior advocate .
to put it into perspective i should also address the exemptions .
i will again give the assurance that we fully support this project .
he is generalising and i am not prepared to answer that type of question .
now the excuse is that the national government has not published the regulations .
if anything is happening there , it is happening entirely without my knowledge .
there is no way that the council could have influenced that decision .
i would further like to know who the shareholders or members of the consulting company are .
we face a special opportunity to work in close cooperation with the city of cape town .
this rolling over of funds year after year has become something of a trend .
certain fraudulent actions will be followed up and those reports will definitely be forthcoming .
i ask him to be patient when all these requests for preference flood in .
i am sure there will be more said from this desk in that regard at a later stage .
sir , any intelligent politician will have known that this was not the normal no-confidence debate .
in six years he has been the fourth leader of the opposition on that side .
it is noted that you based your ruling on the following points .
there cannot be a point of order on a point of order .
we do , however , not necessarily interfere if we do not really have to .
to provide for all the requirements an amount of four times more would be necessary .
staying in this beautiful province must not become an act of faith only .
i think that it took extraordinary bravery and commitment to make that speech .
what is the policy and can we please have it so that we can engage with it ?
there is no doubt that we have come a long way regarding this bill .
let us not think that we have all the knowledge within this building .
here today , all of a sudden , i hear that i may have an element of competence .
first of all , it is not my function to investigate these matters .
but did not on one occasion come up with any credible evidence .
the question is , what role this provincial government is going to play in support of these efforts .
as a result the department has expanded a great deal since he took it over .
it is a way of regulating a contribution and eliciting a positive participation .
we must extend our role in this regard and this must be brought to the fore .
it is necessary to see to it that this matter is reflected in their budgets .
his services do not go unnoticed and they are very much appreciated .
in many respects they cannot even perform the essential services in the street .
please leave the police alone as well as the idea that the community has of the police .
achievements during the last year have been fairly considerable in the department of sport and recreation .
they also managed to come up with a facility database .
this would enable us to know exactly where these facilities are needed .
we must not forget the role of sport in the development of our youth .
when a soccer player moves from one team to another , millions of rand change hands .
i really think that would help us to enable school sport to come into its own .
i really think it is a noble and a good aim that we can all follow .
at the same time , we undertook to put together a policy for discussion by june this year .
swimming is another good method , without impacting on the body .
that falls under the department of works , but we shall see what we can do .
the sign , used subsequently in the same speech , indicates the original language .
however , we also want to hear more clearly and timeously what the people are demanding of us .
when they are old it must be our privilege to make them feel safe .
his christening of our society is still apt today , despite the demise of apartheid .
it is largely as a result of actions and strategies undertaken before my time .
time is often overlooked , but it is an essential element in education .
what is taken for granted by some schools is a very ambitious target for others .
however , there is no cause and effect relationship between resources and performance .
good management is the key to turning financial resources into an educational investment .
we hope this wait is nearing an end because it is becoming somewhat frustrating .
i think that this would also limit the disciplinary problems encountered in the schools .
this approach argues that departments and schools often attempt to do too much .
we all do , and we will give her all the support in this regard .
i have checked with the national office , and no such instructions have been given .
what will change the education system is the recognition that it is an extremely complex system .
education adds life-long value to an individual and society and cannot be expropriated .
once again i want to stress that this is not an easy matter .
we shall all have to look into our own hearts and be truly honest .
and all of this has been happening while we have been a society in transition and in isolation .
this leads to verbal and even physical abuse in the classrooms and on the playground .
it is a very long list , so it cannot be next week .
in those instances where potential problems with efficiency are identified , remedial steps will be taken .
this benefit is available to all patients and not only private paying patients .
we will be focusing in the coming year on the implementation of a proper revenue incentive framework .
i think we need to change that perception , because it is not necessarily the truth .
if a person is feeling ill , and he is poor , he must also be treated well .
if one goes to a clinic one can see that it is a problem .
i know of an instance in my area where medicine was stolen from the hospital .
unless we give it to them , the exodus to private hospitals will continue .
national government should learn to reward performance and not punish it .
i do not believe in different policies for health , because we live in one country .
i think we are getting there with regard to the rural areas .
in the meeting of the standing committee last night they , too , made very valuable inputs .
four of them have been upgraded and refurbished to accommodate awaiting-trial youths in the western cape .
what is going to happen to our teenagers in schools where their only income at this stage is the maintenance grant ?
it is notable how this point of departure of mine is on everyone 's lips nowadays .
provincial ministers must account for their money , not national ministers ' money .
it would appear that more and more families are losing their homes as a result of bad debts .
that will put us in a position to augment our funds to some extent .
he will never understand , because he does not know the history of district six .
they are doing their level best , but one can never be satisfied just with that .
how do we as a government act in a way that will give these people hope ?
he knows as well as i do that the act had to be amended hurriedly last year .
i want to refer briefly to the staff of the department , specifically in that division .
i would like to move on to the second matter , viz the financial viability of local government .
we want to congratulate them and thank them for the good work that they are doing there .
legislation will come to this house very soon .
i do not think that it is necessary for our municipalities to refer to them at this stage .
that is one of the aspects that we are currently looking at in the municipalities .
i would like to refer to the protection of the integrity of the future local authorities .
for once in history , the western cape can walk tall .
i will refer to each one of them and tell you what you said .
we should start being honest when we make speeches in the house .
we desperately need to get to grips with the expectations we have of labour and they have of us .
we should not let these political tensions stand in the way of an effective transition .
this is a federal government and this is a federal party sitting here .
we are not merely administrative extensions of national ministries , and that is the point .
the legislation is ready and i can put it on the table for them right now .
we do not agree with everything in it , but those inputs will also be made .
i also think that this is being approached sensibly and with great responsibility in this province .
what he told us today was not , therefore , new information .
i have now been the political head of development planning for a period of some seven months .
i want to ask a question , and i will ask it in a very subtle way .
in fact , i felt quite bad for them at one point .
the first lesson it teaches us is that development planning is highly technical and complex .
the problem that we have and that i have been taught about is that time costs money .
our focus has therefore always been on the senior level of management in this administration .
i am going back a little to the days when i was involved in local government .
it is time for this development to be brought within the reach of all population groups .
it was left to the committee to decide whether they wanted to go ahead or not .
i did not have a calculator with me when i studied the list .
we may have to look at the way in which it is managed in future .
first of all , i have never felt marginalised in this cabinet .
it took me the first few months in my portfolio to deliberate on this .
he adopts a sanctimonious air , but in the meantime he has done these people so much harm .
it is for these reasons that my department has set itself the following objectives .
means must be sought to overcome the limited scope for entry by new contractors .
i have read the speech and it states that there is no problem here .
this would further force the drivers of these vehicles to adhere to the law .
today i wish to thank the provincial officials who went out of their way .
i would be very interested to know who actually did get it .
unfortunately that white company was not lucky and they did not get it .
we do not like seeing advertisements on every pole and every bridge .
therefore our top priority is to see to it that the senior staff get parking .
we must do these things , and if this is a problem we must deal with it .
quite possibly they are social workers who are in a hurry to get to work .
i want to ask her how many times a year she fills her car 's petrol tank .
we can use this point of order specifically in order to get some clarity .
one cannot simply refer to this as a challenge ; it is a crisis .
these are the things that must clean the exhaust system in order to get the air clean .
sometimes , however , it is far more difficult , particularly when a decision has to be made about conflicting demands .
the component is now scheduled to investigate the rationalising of offices in george , paarl and worcester .
there is no doubt that they have done a superlative job in the past year .
i know that it is a national competency , and we are not going to go into that .
i am still struggling to get a copy of the report , apart from anything else .
as a whole africa is our biggest trading partner and i think that that is very positive .
that is due to people being placed in positions for which they did not have the capacity .
those people have contributed and continue to contribute extensively to our debate .
because they want to gain power in this province ; that is why they are breaking it down .
it is my desire that agriculture will shortly enjoy the same benefits as the fishing industry .
it is the duty of the government to protect its citizens and their property .
a hard year lies ahead for the standing committee on economic affairs and tourism .
are there any of us who can still wonder today why white commercial farmers are successful ?
i began to wonder whether the man had undergone some form of conversion .
but a tractor that cultivates agricultural land and is used to sow it , has to pay for the development of the roads !
the children have to eat , they have to be washed , and there are things to do .
i really want to tell her that we must stop singling out the farm workers .
the sign , used subsequently in the same speech , indicates the original language .
if we want to be proud of our province , the good things have to be communicated .
however , we also want to hear more clearly and timeously what the people are demanding of us .
when they are old it must be our privilege to make them feel safe .
his christening of our society is still apt today , despite the demise of apartheid .
it is not only because of the current issue that we have drafted this legislation .
transport in this province will remain in a morass until proper and appropriate legislation is in place .
i have a document here , which was submitted , on how to deal with these issues .
we are all aware of the danger that it imposes on passengers and other users .
let us decide that what has happened here today must never happen again .
we may not allow people 's lives to be at risk again .
as soon as that happens , the peace is shattered and we go through a whole new cycle .
the matter he brought to the house concerns the people out there .
the budget of the department of safety and security is to be submitted in the national assembly on thursday .
let me assure them that i shall do everything possible to support him .
then the report came back from my department and was given to the head of department .
if they are going to play a positive role i ask them to please think about this .
it is difficult for the chair to determine whether the contents are exactly the same .
i do not think it is relevant to move that motion here now .
the facts of the matter is that there was a call by the national government .
we believe it comes very close to actually paying people to register .
if that is the trend , we are going to start making snide remarks to one another .
unfortunately , yesterday we were not given any details of how the expenditure was made .
the point i am making is that there was no haste in this regard .
i cannot pronounce on a periodical which may be of an academic nature .
i would like to know if you are going to permit questions regarding those votes and the expenditure .
we cannot approve this unauthorised expenditure in anticipation of detailed written replies .
this has absolutely nothing to do with the grant that central government gives .
there is not enough money for health in this country and all over the world .
when they die that money is a saving because i do not pay it out any more .
how did he know that he would not get new people in the following month ?
if we have to do the process again , then that is what we are going to have to do .
can we get clarity about whether people are , in fact , leaving ?
in fact , these savings were made last year november when the original bill was tabled .
how was the criteria used in determining that amount , and who determined it ?
i would ask you specifically to rule whether i have been in contempt .
the chairperson has made a ruling and i ask that her ruling be respected .
i was wary about the cost because we are running a big department with many officials .
which of the programmes does he feel the money could best be allocated from ?
but , again , i will answer the question in more detail at another stage .
he has to decide in terms of his policies what the priorities are and where he can cut .
i am sorry , but you put the question and the house voted on it .
the only point that is outstanding is that at least three persons have to support that .
let us give the poor the most hope , because then we all have hope .
it is indeed an honour for me to stand in this situation here today .
whatever the department does has a direct result on the community outside .
we should be able to deliver it to them in a reasonable time .
that is not conducive to the progress of our province and all its people .
he is exploiting the words of the national minister of labour to cause friction .
during last year and during the festive season fires ravaged many of these communities .
we must deliver to all our people and not just the selected few .
a clean community does not give us a whole society in the long term .
in the community of mitchells plain this morning a black priest was kicked out by the church people .
once again this attested to a province which has a government that works .
i can give them the assurance that there are people out there who appreciate it a great deal .
sometimes it seems as if a deafness develops when it comes to commercial farmers .
it is not always spelt out in these terms , but we owe them a great deal .
we shall have to look into our own hearts and appreciate what contribution we make .
it is not right to deal with our people 's lives in that way .
of course , we also wish all those who were injured in the process a speedy recovery .
it cannot wait for five years or two years or even one year .
it is a question of six of the one and half a dozen of the other .
who has the most to gain out of the violence in the industry at the moment ?
we have every intention of ensuring that that place is full to the brim if necessary .
it is really unfair to the house for it to have to decide on motions like this .
that is why public authorities like us and local government should contribute to it .
finally , i also wish to thank two persons who played a major role in this .
it also provides that the centre should be properly marketed and efficiently managed .
we on this side of the house are satisfied that we have done our duty .
sir , it gives me great pleasure to enter this important debate .
it is simply being asked to authorise shareholding in that company , as well as its contributions .
many of them were here for the first time and they bought houses .
i think we can apply our own minds and think for ourselves as a provincial government .
therefore , i am very happy with the constitution of the board as it is .
we are saying that the province is obliged to act in a certain way .
one therefore cannot just do it by a variation of existing agreements .
it really has to do with the decision-making and governance process within a specific municipality .
provincial legislation must determine the different types of municipality to be established in the province .
that is why we are there , and that is why the national department was there .
they ought not to be in the department if they cannot guide you .
this new role of local government will be fulfilled within a radically new legislative framework .
we are pleased to fully endorse and support this bill .
probably he simply mentioned it in an effort to state his standpoint a little more strongly today .
unfortunately we are unable to wait at this stage ; we have to carry on with the process .
people can do as they like , because the law no longer takes its course .
the answer is no , it received a meagre increase in its annual budget .
that is what these talks are aimed at doing and this coalition government will do it !
you are bringing this country to ruin , you and your policies .
we said we would not " vry " if there were no divorce .
they are not prepared to be part of building this nation !
to them this was one of the motions that really should come up here .
in this new competitive environment in the global context , banks need to restructure their financial packages .
these studies will then be turned into formal complaints from persons who have been aggrieved .
we must keep up a level of criticism and debate on the issue of the banks .
the first problem is that there has been until now an inability to understand this .
the sign , used subsequently in the same speech , indicates the original language .
suggestions of further increases therefore are , to put it mildly , met with obvious hostility .
these are important things that we shall have to look into and that we shall have to say to one another .
we really need to get the community involved , if they want the specific area to be upgraded .
it stipulates that there will not be a pronouncement on traditional authorities at this juncture .
it is certainly not true that municipalities or certain areas did not contribute .
rest assured that together with our other priorities , this will enjoy a very high priority .
then he is simply like a mouse , in total recess , and only his overwhelming silence is audible .
i took into account that he wanted to make a general remark .
upon opening , revenue in the form of taxes will immediately be channelled to the province .
here , again , the application for departure was received when the building was almost completed .
because they were hoping to get the gallery and the crowds there .
sir , it is only being done now , which raises the question : are there more important considerations ?
is there more than a danger of a public perception of a conflict of interests ?
if one does not have a conflict of interest one does not need to disclose it .
i have nothing to do with the compilation or the order of the agenda .
they are people who have been brought onto the boards of directors for their personal knowledge of matters .
the department must try to explain to the people the cause of the explosions .
it also encapsulates my approach to the current situation with the urban terror .
who was invited to speak on behalf of the coloured people at the recent conference on racism ?
why then should the composition of the cabinet not be done likewise ?
they could have appointed three blacks , but they refused the posts .
we know that on that side of the house they would really like to wish it away .
any undue reference to race and racism , this discourse would argue , is a setback for reconciliation .
it challenges the primary victims to be exclusively the source of the solution .
the fact of the matter is that by his definition , he cannot .
everyone knows about the advertisements that will be placed in the newspapers the coming weekend .
yes , sir , i did use the word , but i would like to know the definition .
sir , the second point that was made is the possibility that poverty can cause aids .
the state prosecutor refused to prosecute him because there were no grounds for prosecution .
this kind of interference , is it racism or is it the expression of hatred of farmers ?
i mean , that must receive preference in order to clear their minds for their work !
that shows that if one starts a motion correctly , one can go far .
he still needs to be inducted by all of us in the province , irrespective of our backgrounds .
i am involved in western cape affairs and that is what i am talking about .
if certain people hardly know how to spell " read " , they will have difficulties .
we have experienced that ; we have been the gateway to africa and everybody has been involved in that .
it does not help when they come here and talk about the national government 's results .
that night he filled the bus and went off to bonteheuwel , and what happened then ?
our cooperation with local government has improved , even after the election in some respects .
the rest were simply thrown to the wolves , and no one cared about them .
what is more important to me , however , is the service provided to the community .
these are not laws drawn up by the province of the western cape ; they are national laws .
racism of any kind is wrong , and i can speak with authority on this matter .
i did , however , speak to the principal of the school and she was shocked beyond belief .
we must guard against bitterness , against allowing bitterness to make us lose our perspective on democracy .
the province has delivered much and there are many achievements of which we are extremely proud .
he cannot do that to a member who has the floor .
we speak of the poor because we know what it is to be poor .
we were made to live in carriages whilst they built themselves houses .
the pressure on the provincial budget for health , welfare , housing and so on is great .
i am told that many of those soldiers came from the western cape .
we are interested in people who provide security to our children and teachers at school .
the message sent out is one of hope and confidence in the province of the western cape .
this freedom and the right of individuals to participate constitute the basis for continued peaceful existence .
then they are classified in groups , but when it suits the them , they are all black .
i want to ask them to cooperate with us in the same way in future .
i was standing in the shop when a white gentleman and his son walked in .
there is no truth in what you are saying , because you did not take action .
for more than six months she has been saying that she has appointed directors in this regard .
the province of the western cape received an award for bring the best-governed province .
however , indications are that the figures in this province are going up .
big business is not investing in the job creation programme , but he did not go there .
the sign , used subsequently in the same speech , indicates the original language .
provincial conditional allocations have been such as to ensure funding of specific priorities , such as hospital equipment and improved financial management .
however , the committee also came together and raised a number of very serious problems in other departments .
we would have expected that acknowledgement to lead to the taking out of that section from the budget .
it is surely not true that they want to flee here because this province applies apartheid .
they were even brave enough to stand up and congratulate some departments .
i do not think that it included that the workers should come from the western cape .
are the poorest of the poor , the women , the youth and the disabled going to benefit from it ?
let us in the western cape show commitment via our cabinet and its departments .
i thank them for their hard work and wish them success for the future .
that report has borne no fruit as far as the young people in this province are concerned .
we would like to see the office promoting itself and communicating to all the people .
i know it sounds racist to bring blacks , coloureds and women into the situation .
our suggestion is that we support and cooperate with governments across the country .
they invited me because they had done a needs analysis in their community and constituency .
they objected , as they are objecting now , for a very good reason .
i do want to say that , barring all this , there was , i think , a good spirit of cooperation today .
this applies not only to sittings of the house , but also to meetings of standing committees .
it is important for us to involve the entire population of the western cape in our activities .
he has certainly taught me how one should try to avoid the pitfalls .
we cannot pretend that political appointments are administrative support for the provincial parliament .
we are in total accord , or at least substantial accord , with what he said about them .
in that way they will have the necessary capacity to do their work .
as i promised , we will look at this again during the course of the year .
a lot of thought will have to go into that legislation so that we have a proper balance .
i trust that we will work together to make our parliament a great institution .
i did not have to confer with both parties at the same time .
the people pay to attend the functions and in this way the choirs make money .
where we do have the authority to make the situation right , we do so .
i imagine that that has been a factor contributing to the delay .
the majority of members of parliament are therefore familiar to them .
we must not forget that these security officers have had only eight weeks ' training .
did not materialise about jobs and houses and the economy and everything else .
the premier of the province went public in denying that our statistics were correct .
i shall try to explain it in english , but i think she grasps it perfectly well .
the steps taken to ensure safe public transport fall into two categories .
firstly , we have taken a number of steps to ensure the immediate safety of commuters .
that is not an across-the-board phenomenon , because these phenomena differ from small town to small town .
if we can still get it through parliament this year , that would be a good thing .
there is no programme , no directive and no policy unless people specifically request it .
it is not the first time that he has generalised when asking a question .
what he is waiting for now is a formula that has to be promulgated at the national level .
i think any conference that is organised in the interests of tourism is a good thing .
how will report card fraud and stay-aways of learners affect the matric pass rate in the province ?
after that i shall be in a position to take a decision on this matter .
if he will have respect for his leader , he can ask me a question afterwards .
the sign , used subsequently in the same speech , indicates the original language .
governments are measured by their delivery and , compared with similar governments , we are doing extremely well .
i would also like to thank all the participants in this morning 's opening ceremony for their contribution .
certainly , not everyone votes for the same party , and that is as it should be .
we will continue with this initiative in the interest of the security of our people .
our delivery has enhanced the western cape 's reputation as a stable and successful province .
i believe our past successes and future plans bear witness to our commitment .
it was truly a wonderful experience to see scof function so smoothly .
let me go on , sir , to thank the personnel of the departments , who were so well prepared .
the staff did not have to wait outside for us again ; we waited for them .
we could therefore do the work that parliament expected us to do .
it has been an interesting exercise for us with , of course , the next one to follow soon .
we had an interesting comment regarding the sittings of the standing committee .
those are critical and essential to the province , but they have been delayed for two years .
firstly , i would like to thank the chairperson and the committee members for their input .
that learning process is important , and especially important is the learning process in regard to budgeting .
they have attempted to play the man and not the ball , which is par for the course , as far as they are concerned .
firstly , the standing rules prescribe the process in terms of which decisions are taken in the house .
it is quite correct ; problems did arise and capacity was one of the problems .
if he had heard that , he would not have asked me that question .
he should not ask me what i personally think is acceptable or not .
we try to meet people to alleviate the problems that they have .
why does it now seem that we have to do the work of the central government ?
a few also utilise a special tax , in terms of which tax is paid on parking areas .
i think we have to go the way of the northern province and mpumalanga .
i trust that i may look forward to the support of the provincial parliament in this regard .
we have accomplished what few other people in the world thought we could do .
scof or an appropriate committee of this house should be fully appraised of that report .
just as an aside , it was interesting to note that the coalition was caught completely on the wrong foot on monday .
the second point i want to highlight is the social ills that come with gambling .
it is a terrible accusation to make with the protection within these four walls .
frankly , i am not so sure that they will .
there is one more thing , and i know i have been preaching about this .
i do want to say , however , that this charge sheet is in no way intended to be a comprehensive list of charges .
they should be recognised here and complimented on their work .
unfortunately , if one speaks to them one gets the idea that those people are being used .
he , as well as one of the previous speakers , talks about where these people are deployed .
what is more , they talk about a lack of coordination , about various authorities and things of that nature .
that is why we have to work hand in glove as civil society with the security forces .
i was not aware that i had attacked the constitution during the previous speech .
we have achieved all the major objectives we have set for ourselves during the financial year .
i am quite prepared , however , to become more involved if it is going to mean an improvement .
i believe that through this effort the directorate will offer a positive alternative to our youth .
the children of these schools have to play in the streets if they want to play sport .
on that day , people from different colours were celebrating because there was a change in this country .
youth in sport and women in sport are also issues that are not being raised .
participation is a voluntary aspect , and it is a horse and water situation .
our parents always went out of their way to make us as children feel safe .
it is wonderful to see that business is now also putting its money where its mouth is .
the honour and privilege of occupying public office demands greater responsibility , pride and patriotism .
bearing this in mind , any criticism of an abuse of power in africa rings extremely hollow .
we in the western cape have such skills and we are prepared to share them .
and when i say this , i am prepared to walk the talk .
if this becomes a problem in the future , the chair will have to adopt a far stricter approach .
our second objective is to introduce benchmarking to ensure quality throughout our education system .
among other things , this may have a serious impact on the labour force and deliver a severe blow to the economy .
the educationalist i have just mentioned sums it up as follows , and i quote :
they phoned all the other schools in the circuit and warned them , and so on .
after all , it is necessary for a child also to learn to play happily on grass .
there is a further need and that is for improving the transport system of this school .
it will cost us nothing , but it will change the whole atmosphere at that hospital .
within one year the public of this province will see the real difference in our health services .
we have taken on the job of ensuring the health of the people of our province .
the lame excuse is that the tertiary budget does not allow those cases to be treated .
i regard a hospital as a structure that should give the people hope and psychological healing .
he , as someone who pioneered the provincial health plan , will understand what i am saying .
because we were told that a national policy was on its way and i adhered to that .
we have done our homework and planned our strategy with regard to training nurses .
i want to thank her for the work she has done as chairperson of the standing committee .
even if one is at school and one is sexually active , one should know one 's status .
i should be obliged if he would provide me with the information that i requested .
we need to create these opportunities now , and in doing so we will relieve the pressures on this department .
we need to see where our priorities are and where the most money should be spent .
let me tell the house in what way she does not have the initiative .
the department of social services has a very good track record of delivery in those kinds of programmes .
they should be rewarded for their contribution and not punished for being old .
yes , we are working , and when the work has been done you claim the credit for it !
we do not have the money to address all the needs within the province .
the department has accordingly planned a number of new ideas and programmes for the coming financial year .
my plea to everybody is not to drag housing into the game of politics .
we still have too many people looking for housing who do not get onto the waiting lists .
the interest on those areas has been recouped , but the people still have to stay there as tenants .
not all the people who claim to have had property there , had property .
people are coming from all over the country because there are opportunities for developers in the western cape .
i am asking the people in the gallery not to participate in the debate .
to many people it is the city that appears to represent the hope of a better , new life .
we also see as one of our objectives municipalities working for the people out there .
the functions will then have to be performed by the new authority , wherever that might be .
in the past we saw many municipalities alienating large tracts of land just before an election .
at this stage neither the province nor any municipality has yet received money for transformation .
no money has been received to date and there is no process in place for that purpose .
i want to thank them for the important role that they play , particularly through their standing committees .
it is a matter of grave concern that the progress with such legislation is extremely slow .
i know of someone else who was also going to go away , but then he did not go .
i also know that he is responsible for the legislation and that he can exercise influence .
millions of rand come to our province , but they do not form part of our budget .
let us stop looking at national government to solve provincial problems .
therefore we on this side of the house are prepared to give it a try .
i do not know whether there is something that he still has to prove to that party .
i must tell them that i am not here to do favours for anyone .
he also referred to municipalities that were almost bankrupt and where there were big problems .
i believe it should go back to the department of local government , but i will get to that .
four years later , there is no indication of when this framework is going to be approved .
the question of what happens to this land is of the utmost importance to this city .
the fourth delay is that involving the regulations for the planning and development act .
perhaps the funds should be channelled into a new plan for the whole new municipal area .
that did not happen , but i believe that the disciplines were at fault .
in conclusion , the culture of man and his environment can make or break a nation .
this change is a direct result of the points that have we raised in this house .
we finally received a list of the number of organisations that are funded in this province .
yes , i know that the hermanus municipal council is being accused of dragging its feet and of a lack of cooperation .
the two of us cannot yet complain that we have exhausted our thinking about this matter .
however , we can be certain that a return to wet conditions will accelerate its deterioration .
clearly his advisers told him that the request of the western cape should not be complied with .
among other things , it was our proposal a few years ago that personal number plates be sold .
what will the consequences for the state be if road accidents can be linked directly to savings ?
they have shown once again that this action is not to help the poor .
for many years there have been unsigned agreements between the province and the district councils on the table .
they obtained donations and the teachers assisted by repairing the toilets after hours .
he and i can talk to each other because he knows the department as well as i do .
these departments are the only departments that are creating jobs , and that is why we are doing this .
we know that we will miss him and his expertise in the department insofar as transport is concerned .
the national minister of transport as well as his predecessor and i have a very good understanding .
i want to express my concern to the chair , because a statement is not a motion .
therefore it is only meaningful and realistic to deal with the two facets in the same agency .
we will shortly hold discussions with the national government on ways to improve the process .
it was put in a financial budget and we committed ourselves to a financial plan .
the western cape should be no exception when it comes to the growth potential of tourism .
i asked this particular question in the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling as well .
he began his speech well by referring to the things in which he supports us .
in this country and this province they are breaking down to the ground .
unless they pull them in , they are not going to create an environment for job creation .
they are not compelled to do this by legislation , but are doing it of their own free will .
i am proud to say that we have made significant progress with this project .
many people are living a better and cleaner life than before because alternatives have been offered to them .
this is one respect in which i think that the new development board could play a tremendous role .
eventually bokkie had to end her school career because she had to help supplement her parents ' meagre income .
there is a drop , because everywhere there are funds that could no longer be rolled over .
stock theft is a major problem for agriculture , and causes even more hardship in agriculture .
if any one party objects , the other parties in the house can speak to that objection .
our parents always went out of their way to make us as children feel safe .
the honour and privilege of occupying public office demands greater responsibility , pride and patriotism .
bearing this in mind , any criticism of an abuse of power in africa rings extremely hollow .
we in the western cape have such skills and we are prepared to share them .
it would be nave to use the closing of ranks as an end in itself .
however , at the same time we must ask whether he will not provide us with the additional funds .
my information is that one of the people who saw me on friday was murdered today .
the reason why i did not go immediately was not because i was afraid .
i do not wish to interfere with the political opinions that were hurled across the floor here .
it is said that the introduction of new members into the gangs is happening all the time .
and then we are being further held back by parties who get into bed with those groups .
does it matter whether it is a gang or foreign soldiers who rape our women ?
on the part of the state we can do a great deal to address this problem .
the resources needed to protect our children must come to the cape flats .
the police must clean up our neighbourhoods on the cape flats of the high number of illegal guns .
it is a list of crimes that have come out over the past years .
and then they did not know that they were saddling a tiger !
you were doing quite well , until you started misrepresenting the constitution .
in the first instance their primary role is to protect the sovereignty of the country .
we are looking forward to a very small opposition on that side of the house next time .
but some people listen and do not want to understand or are unable to understand .
all of us who were really involved in the election knew that we had a problem .
it was expected of us as a single department to make whatever contribution we could .
however , i can say that the money was expended for travelling only in that particular instance .
there was no loss to health services in terms of these exercises in both the schedules .
there was no loss to health , because the treasurer gave the money back to us .
i cannot answer the question because i do not have the information in front of me .
in this case we have also had savings on posts which we had not filled .
unless i go back to my accounting officers , i cannot give them an answer .
that is what i placed on record , and which i just want to place on record again .
i just believe that people were paid on a ratio of the time they worked .
if there are no decisions around the matter , then we will continue with the schedule .
if not , can he tell me why he did not apply his mind to that issue ?
i do not know ; no one knows what is going to happen to the end of the financial year .
sir , education is the single largest and most important tool to lift people out of poverty .
however i stand here , too , with a feeling of deep humility and a sense of responsibility .
since last year this portfolio has time and again been pushed from pillar to post .
precious time has been lost in the meantime , and criminals were afforded unnecessary freedom and unnecessary space .
often public servants are taken for granted because they are paid from taxpayers ' money .
clearly by his own test he has failed the people of the province .
the people of the western cape will also be following the address of the president with keen interest .
if fact , there would be no poor people if that is happening !
inhabitants of the rural areas are streaming to the city in large numbers hoping to find work .
sir , i am not referring here even to the theft of cattle , pigs and other stock .
and that is why we intend to keep on trying to be different in the western cape .
in principle , in the report there was no fundamental rejection of anything in the appropriation .
if they can prove their point , they will gain a lot of mileage on that issue .
we are now asking the central government whether we can utilise those savings for other projects .
if we look at the industry and permits , it is in total disarray and conflict .
there is a great problem within the industry in recognising the board .
i wonder whether this is really a process of scoring cheap political points .
this unit has reported that on certain days the disruption to schooling has been very significant .
i believe that there may be as much of a scandal here as there is in the fishing industry .
they should not stay in constantia and then violate our areas at our expense .
i then contacted the national minister of welfare and population development , who was acting in his place .
i am concerned that we are breaking a convention which has been built up in the house up until now .
however , any decision taken by the company requires the approval of all three shareholders .
it is , and , as i have said , it is almost deceitful to claim otherwise .
new job opportunities urgently needed for growth in our country are also ensured in this way .
i also extend my thanks to all the members who participated in the debate .
it was a nice try , but it is not going to ruin the legal validity of the agreements .
we must provide for it in this agreement and anticipate those agreements which are still going to follow .
it is clearly based on the original text , because it is there that it becomes redundant .
this brings us to the point at which we must decide today on the various types of municipalities .
the president does it , but he begrudges us that right at local government level .
may i add , they reflect a set of values deeply imbedded in the apartheid ideology .
it must not be seen by other parties as our intervening in the judicial system .
in order to circumvent what the judges had said , the government then changed the constitution .
we brought new hope , a new future and light to our people at that time .
the highest statistics for rape , sexual abuse and murder are to be found in that group .
theoretically the provinces should feed national government with its strategies for economic growth .
many of them simply do not have the management and experience to do this .
we will continue to support it and we will continue to put money in it .
i also had difficulty following exactly what the content of the motion was .
i think that if one big mistake was made , it was that this was kept secret .
we also accept that there is going to be an equal distribution of rates within the specific area .
however there are certain problems that i wish to single out to which we must indeed refer .
they have a total budget that can be controlled and in terms of which they can set their priorities .
while this is very positive there are , however , other realities that are linked to agriculture .
the current political economic circumstances in the international arena have a direct impact on agriculture .
that is a matter of serious concern and we find it in so many areas .
other cases included attempted murder obviously , robbery with a firearm , rape , assault and housebreaking .
it is pointless our saying that our hearts are heavy today and being dramatic about it .
however , that information was not forthcoming from the officials because they dismissed the issues .
i told them to find out the desirability so that they could advise me on it .
they have not bothered to examine the factual or the legal evidence .
if it were someone like him , we would not need to worry about it .
i thank him for coming and gracing the house with his presence during this discussion .
one only needs to disclose conflicts of interest if one has a conflict of interest .
the worst is that they put people there who perhaps did not understand afrikaans .
it is not defined in terms of who one is but how one thinks .
nobody can claim a right to be in the provincial parliament , irrespective of colour .
nobody has ever said it is the right of anybody to be here .
why are there some who are so desperate to try to deny any debate on racism ?
to begin with , the western cape is the only province in which rationalisation was carried out to the letter .
if he is a member , we call on them to dismiss this person .
on many farms farm workers , brown and black , are not regarded as people at the moment .
sir , i am thinking about their wages , accommodation and the attitude adopted on the farms .
they made a big issue of a case before the accused was even found guilty .
a subject for discussion cannot be put to the house to vote on .
the committee would also like to request that the bill be delayed until such time as the following major concerns have been addressed :
not one member of the cabinet had an instruction to tell a lie .
if they want to know more about our culture they should come to sit and drink with us .
the second issue that i would i like to deal with is the developments within the area of the province .
this issue is not just about the injustices of the past , which we all know about .
we must avoid falling into that dangerous trap in this province .
i think it should be recorded that he is not available and is at home ill .
i will do this with special reference to the five plans enunciated by him .
very often it is not the facts that count but the perception that government leaders create .
this is a sea-change in domestic politics and it has started here in the western cape .
he therefore has to be perfectly honest and say that they had a drop in support .
that is what that side of the house is continually saying to the people of this country .
i would guess that most of my family have been in this country longer than his family .
the government here must be judged by what it does for the poor people of this province .
we will no longer talk about who the people are who take part in those matches .
that money could have been utilised for the construction and upgrading of sports facilities for the youth .
this once again proves what an important role sport plays in a young person 's life .
they had to drive fear into them , and when people are fearful , they will do strange and irresponsible things .
farm workers were driven by farmers on trucks to vote , and large-scale intimidation took place .
i think we laid a good foundation for what had to happen in future .
i must immediately mention our cooperation with the national minister for provincial and local government .
i expected there to be much more debate about the composition of the councils .
sir , i now come to my next point , and i think it is an important point .
therefore calls on the premier to honour his commitment to the house .
his analysis yesterday of the election results proves beyond any doubt that he needs such classes .
unfortunately too many of his colleagues could not bring themselves to do the same .
by saying so they are trying to suggest that this government does not care about the poor .
moreover , as time goes by the people in those provinces are also becoming aware of the differences .
yet she arrives at the conclusion that the referral was ludicrous and a matter of grave concern .
i plead that we should develop our human resources and give them a chance .
in it he warns that the province can be torn apart because the blacks feel cast aside .
this is undoubtedly one of the greatest challenges of our time , if not the very greatest one .
he said that he and his government had sufficient political will , but their hands were tied .
give the province the muscle that it needs as far as safety and security is concerned .
at present people are getting too much information , all saying the same thing but in a different way .
these are their own people , but they are frustrated , because promises were made to them .
there were tears in his eyes , because he had promised his people that they would win .
we can say with great certainty that there will be no problems from our side .
i , too , am proud of this province and it is all of these things he has said .
what steps can we take in this province to improve the competence of our police services ?
why must questions be answered or statements made along black and white lines ?
i am not going to horsewhip the man ; i will not do it .
i sat in a school during registration and spoke to some of these poor students .
they do not even know how the computers come to be in those schools .
they campaign for the elections and other things , and spend the taxpayers ' money .
he said that that was not an excuse ; we had to arrest them .
many clear examples of this have been given by my colleagues and i am not going to repeat those .
if that is what a province of losers looks like , then i do not know what losers are .
we are talking about the double standards being applied , which have been demonstrated clearly .
there were controversial decisions and suggestions on how to legalise illegal expenditure on the elections .
to protect , enhance and promote the total environment for the optimal development of our people .
however , it nonetheless remains true that the children of the poor are being reached by the provincial education system .
once more the long hours involved in the proceedings of scof highlighted certain gross shortcomings .
that is why the committee was forced to report as it has .
it is something that was actively promoted and created by the other side of the house .
it is up to the other side of the house and the government to tell us which it is .
it is true that many flee to the western cape from other provinces .
we are also encouraged by the fact that there is a register of provincial assets being prepared .
why is there a problem in giving us and scof some feedback regarding those issues ?
according to a recent survey , the two most critical issues in the western cape are job creation and crime .
later on we can consider how it can be done for education , health care , and so on .
political farsightedness and political will , combined with a strong transformation vision , is what we need .
it is this kind of thing that we shall have to look at in serving our people .
i agree with him , and join him , when he talks about representivity .
i do not think that there is any harm in investigating a matter like that .
this government wants to communicate with the leaders of all communities , irrespective of the parties they represent .
our creator has given women a wonderful place in the scheme of things in this life .
the focus in regard to these projects is specifically on women and the youth .
it has existed for many centuries and we are not going to correct this overnight .
i would be the first to admit that i am a very green politician .
i believe that there is an enormous vacuum in this regard in the office of the premier .
it is a critical portfolio and also critical that the plan should come to fruition .
the success of the rdp was minimal , although the principles on which it was based are laudable .
it is sometimes very difficult to be a referee and to play in the game as well .
let me tell them what their comrade the mayoress of oudtshoorn did last year .
they tried to gatecrash the meeting in the evening , but i said that i was sorry .
in any building , and therefore here too , we are heavily dependent on the department of works .
during the past session we had a list of motions , and some became stale .
why is it , when one comes to parliament , that this process is not important ?
provincial legislatures around this country seem to have the same problem in that they are not adequately funded .
when we refer to the provincial government , we must realise it starts in this building .
we are actually not competing with the other legislatures far away , but with the national parliament .
the constitution provides for legislation being enacted so that parliament can , in fact , do that .
the public should be given full and accurate information about the public service they are entitled to .
i did not have to consult with both parties at any time .
can he give the house a commitment that he will not do that again ?
it is therefore not going to be tabled shortly - it was tabled today .
i was invited to the meeting , and it was left in the hands of the organisers .
they have suffered in long queues and been misinformed or had no information .
i have not had a report-back yet , but i believe it was a good meeting .
it was not referred to the executive committee until we started asking questions here .
if required , arrangements can be made to request this from pretoria , in writing .
that is a serious problem because we in the committee did not see it beforehand .
it is also unfair to the people that come here to hear constructive questions .
what was the first promise that was made by the national minister of safety and security ?
how many of the important posts filled at central level have collapsed to date ?
all the posts have to be filled , and everyone who qualifies for a post must apply .
we need to ask another question : who is actually the minister of transport in the province ?
i am personally aware of the circumstances in bonteheuwel and of the need for a satellite police station .
there are certain technical points that require adjustment , and that will have to be done .
a certain aspect contained in the regulations will have to be incorporated in the act , however .
there is no problem in making this available to members of the committees .
every allegation was immediately investigated and to date every allegation has been found to be unsubstantiated .
certificates have also been issued for properties that are used for official housing of the premier and officials .
the national department is investigating the matter which , according to reports , was raised with the national department .
long queues are definitely experienced in front of the pharmacist 's door at the end of the day .
it is being handled by the attorneys of the two parties , and that is where it rests .
just before i came here an issue of human error was reported to me .
i can assure him that he has joined an excellent team which has performed well .
on behalf of all the people of our province , i thank each one who has made a positive contribution .
joint projects and strategies will be investigated and announced during the course of the coming year .
through the implementation and execution of these important initiatives we can and will make a difference !
this is another area where cooperation between the province and local authorities can yield results .
i stated in the house last year that there was a smoking gun .
i believe that it is going to be a very constructive year and that we are going to be working hard .
firstly , there are the funds which have become available at the national level .
secondly , there are the funds which have become available at the provincial level .
sir , parents in the other provinces have become desperate , and we have heard it in this house .
they are doing a very good job and i ask all concerned not to politicise it .
what is he planning to put in place in terms of a policy linked to that ?
that is how it is described in the constitution of the western cape and also in the national constitution .
implementation of this project is expected to commence during april this year .
of course , he leaves out the fact that he is only critical of enrichment when it comes to blacks .
let me go further : it could be the key to the development or disintegration of a province .
we should not only slam them , but also give credit where credit is due .
even with the protection of this house , i am not going to start rumour-mongering over here .
i was quoting a well-known expression in order to indicate that there is honour amongst people .
i guarantee that he does not know the figure , and he is guessing at it .
we are going to miss him , but we wish him everything of the best in his coming well-deserved period of rest .
the only method is that firearms should be banned totally where people are not capable of using them .
i am extremely concerned , because i do not know how we are going to get that under control .
this certainly indicates to me a lack of transformation and the will to change .
i have seen a lot of good work coming out of it , especially where there is a focus on the elderly .
an example of this lack of transformation is the situation here in the legislature .
in fact , unlike the other state workers , they do not get a thirteenth cheque .
we need to give our people who work in our streets the respect and dignity that they deserve .
this information is to be used in future decisions regarding the development of facilities for sport and recreation .
he will understand that we can only make a minor contribution from the budget we have .
this form of cooperation has proved to augur well for all the people of the western cape .
i believe we can spread the wealth of our knowledge and expertise beyond our borders .
we will not continue to reward poor performance and make endless excuses for it .
there is so much to do in this arena and so few resources at our disposal .
although it is a start , one computer per school is hopelessly inadequate to achieve this objective .
we simply have no choice but to prepare our learners for this challenge .
we have made substantial progress in rationalising the system that cares for youth at risk .
what i should like to know is the criteria on which such a decision is based .
i wish to reiterate that there has been no significant transformation of education initiated by this province .
but in view of the deficit on the budgets of all the schools , was it such a meaningful decision ?
the windows are broken , there is no proper furniture and the floors are made of cement .
this is a complex process that arises out of the fact that we have combined four previous departments .
furthermore , there has been a lot of criticism of the fact that schools in similar neighbourhoods got different allocations .
i am not pretending that this route is easy or that there are any quick fixes .
i despair sometimes when i go to schools and find a complete disregard for authority .
we have identified benchmarks to ensure that we see it at all levels of the system .
we shall make it available at our clinics to the older persons who are really at risk .
this will prevent their being laid off from work and thus jeopardising the research .
it is just a pity that i do not see the financial manager sitting in the bay there .
that would go a long way towards at least giving us a focus on the future .
we cannot reverse this process merely by withholding licences for private hospitals .
this is being rectified by the national minister , also by letter to all the provincial ministers of health .
we are concerned about the changes in medicine and we are looking at that .
the protocol for the management of child abuse and neglect has been in place for two and a half years .
the terms of reference for the consultant , on the basis of the advertisement , are to establish a structure .
communities should be informed and prepared to enable them to cope with this situation .
it is an enormous challenge and we would love to see how the department fares in this regard .
they have been proved wrong , and i really want to thank those officials for playing that role .
we were firmly convinced that we were about to confront a crisis of unprecedented proportions .
sir , they sold because the price was so good that they could not say no .
the lack of housing is usually a phenomenon that afflicts the poorest of the poor worst .
if there are any shortcomings in the national legislation , we will correct them with provincial legislation .
my idea is to appoint an interim chief executive officer or town clerk for the municipality .
let me conclude by issuing one or two warnings , including one regarding the money for transformation .
we cannot go through something similar again and be caught with our pants down .
in a limited sense this might be true , but it may provide other and perhaps unexpected problems .
i will also attempt , in respect of certain negative speeches , to uphold the dignity of the house .
just a week ago he asked why we were getting involved in providing money for identity documents and registrations .
this is not a matter of boasting that they are better than the other municipalities .
that was not always the doing of the authorities , whoever the authorities might have been .
what i do want to comment on is the fact that there is outstanding service delivery to the community .
is that there is not sufficient experience in dealing with public participation in this process .
firstly , there is the core or the most ecologically sensitive and natural area where conservation is a priority .
there need to be enforceable penalties in this regard and the message should be communicated to the public .
there is a problem that we have always had and were taught about in development planning .
what we are talking about is the desire of those professionals to work in this provincial administration .
the question that arises immediately is what percentage of success they have reached thus far in this regard .
the point is that one should not to say that one should keep politics out of planning .
in my speech i did not use the opportunity to thank him specifically .
i am not prepared to go to the premier and recommend this board .
finally , after a long time , some money , but not enough , is being given to brown issues .
people were culturally deprived to adjust successfully to a life in a rapidly changing society .
i am sure that they will manage them better than the national department is doing at present .
it is quite a thick document , and what i have here is not the whole document .
these " vriende van die stellenbosch museum " , whoever they are , have been funded at least thrice .
he also expressed concerns regarding the survival of the arts , such as ballet , opera and orchestra .
however , the good news is that i have spoken to the national minister of environmental affairs and tourism .
interviews have been conducted and we shall shortly be announcing the candidate to be appointed to this post .
an office serving the needs of this section of the industry will shortly be established .
hopefully he has the infrastructure to maintain what he is expected to maintain .
unfortunately i was put on the red carpet because people felt we were driving the process too fast .
the western cape always likes to go its own way , like an island , on its own .
i do not see it here now , but i can tell him off the top of my head .
how they will get into his car if he does not provide the keys , i do not know .
the strategic objectives of the department of transport and works read as follows , and i quote :
more than half of the roads have been classified as poor and will have to be rebuilt entirely .
i realise that the regulations still have to be passed , but i believe that they are nearing completion .
i understand how the system works when one applies for one of these personalised plates .
i am also sure that the resultant easier access to special plates would increase the demand .
it is because the funds were not correctly utilised that the maintenance of roads has deteriorated .
the department of public works has not gone back to do the maintenance at that school !
how many of those people who could qualify for these categories were actually black people or women ?
we are dealing with them , and i referred to them earlier and also this morning during the meeting of the standing committee .
we cannot place laws on the statute book and not implement those laws or apply them properly .
the only departments in this administration that create jobs are the departments of works and of transport .
we have a responsibility to look to the needs of all the people in the province .
i have just referred to some of them , and i am not going to mention that again .
that is why i say that if anything can be done , we must look at this .
it is very difficult to speak about tenders , because the tender does not belong with us .
the employees with their individual , and also collective knowledge and competencies , are becoming a company 's most valuable asset .
to do that , they are forced to stay abreast of global trends .
this will mean that we must bring information from throughout the administration to a central point .
i need not dwell on the implications of passing flawed legislation .
what his department does is of critical importance to the province as a whole , and i must underwrite that .
we are content that it seems as though at this stage there has been a change of attitude in the department .
in the first place , it is competition and in the second place , they are prejudiced as well .
let me firstly deal with the issue of the presence of members of the cabinet in the house .
i actually do not expect any members of the cabinet other than myself to be here .
the debate is simply between the responsible member of the cabinet and the members of the house .
a country can no longer practice import substitution ; that is something that simply cannot happen any more .
he gave us his support in many of the areas that we are involved in .
we accept that a revolutionary change in the world economy like this has both positive and negative spin-offs .
one also has to start putting an emphasis on those industries that are going to create jobs in the future .
we cannot do everything at the same time , but it is certainly on the agenda for the future .
we shall also take new established farmers by the hand , assist them and train them to be profitable .
in addition , we have to compete with overseas producers that receive very large subsidies from their governments .
usually men and women have specific and differing roles on the farms and they have different needs .
however , more must be done to give people the insight and the will for agriculture .
looking back , he says that up to now he has really had a good life .
it is my view that one must set an example and make a start .
he levelled so little criticism at my address that i can scarcely believe it !
and then the western cape had to help them with advice on how to extricate themselves from their problems .
yes , i say , because which other industry would be prepared to buy housing for its workers .
this form of cooperation has proved to augur well for all the people of the western cape .
i believe we can spread the wealth of our knowledge and expertise beyond our borders .
we also agreed that it may be possible that we effect amendments to the original bill .
they do not give the right for our people to become the target of intimidation .
we must continue to search for solutions and only use the act as a last resort .
they stood there and waited for the buses , irrespective of the distances they had to walk .
they should not be under the impression that the amendments only came from one side .
i was the one who asked why we were giving the minister powers in the regulations .
at that stage those provinces needed the amendments to contain the violence there .
i do not say that there was opposition , i say that this is the path taken by a bill .
it seems like they cannot forget that they were once there themselves .
i have spoken before in this house about the unacceptably high levels of violence against our children .
when i was a young man , i had to read books about the revolutionary war , and so on .
what happened was that there was some limited funding after we had kicked and shouted .
the children first have to die before the police focus on it , because they take it very seriously .
he is not able to mobilise people to do voluntary work for democracy .
they did not turn round and say that they did not believe we should be paying the people .
should the reply be in writing , it will be after the bill has been passed by the house .
what is happening here today is that the ministers and the cabinet are evading crucial questions on this expenditure .
i assume that they did their job ; otherwise the people would not have been registered .
our rules make provision for discussing these schedules in the way that we are doing .
if we must go through this process , let it be the process as ruled by the chairperson .
i shall make the list available to this house containing all the names and where they work .
probably that will now be necessary , so that all hon members can take note of that before the house adjourns .
we gather to open the third session of the second provincial parliament in the western cape .
they look to us to speak also in terms of redemption , as we speak in terms of punishment .
let us also agree to fight hard about the details and the programmes and the plans .
in every single block there was a family who had lost somebody over the last few weeks .
this is one department which cannot act and not be seen by the community .
if he wants to do a somersault now then he must do a somersault , but then the people must hear about it .
what does that actually say about inequality and how does it impact on race in our province ?
it is a misnomer to talk about the western cape as if it stands alone .
i think it is an honour that both of these awards were awarded in this province , the western cape .
they throw average figures at us all the time about how we are not really unemployed .
sir , i live on a farm where grapes are harvested ; i know how one harvests grapes .
hopefully , once all the renovations have been finally completed , the temporary inconvenience may have been worthwhile .
it was a foregone conclusion during the election campaign that their voters were going to drop them .
after his doctor had declared him physically unfit , he was evicted from the farm without any remuneration .
that is why it is the responsibility of this government to work in partnership with the agriculturists .
treatment for these courageous mothers , who only wanted to save their babies , surely must be a national priority .
that is what is at stake and that is what we in the western cape will prevent .
we also intend to improve on the results obtained in the past two years .
we can do so , because we have built a solid infrastructure and a strong team in khayelitsha .
everybody seems to be happy to be taken on board in dealing with the funds .
they probably suffered even more because they had probably entered into contracts to spend that money .
why did they not use the money to put them where they are suggesting ?
the safe schools unit in the department of education has been going to all the affected areas .
at one stage the department was investigating setting up separate transport for the children .
is to protect the environment affected by this violence in which people are living and working .
as a minister he at least has the statutory framework that protects him and that he can fall back on .
i fear that it may be profoundly clever , but i hope it is profoundly stupid .
we will advertise and get nominations from the public for members to serve on the board .
i am so excited , because we are moving towards exciting times , but they always have to spoil the fun .
in addition , the bill grants authorisation for the funds that the provincial government will provide the company .
i hope that the bill will be adopted unanimously this afternoon , because this piece of legislation is most needed .
the standing committee did not have an opportunity to apply its mind on this issue .
it is saving time and energy for this house in the future if we actually do it now .
thereafter the bill , with its amendments , comes back to the house as approved by the standing committee .
the committee wishes to once again express its grave concern that disciplinary action is extended over such long periods .
that is the only reason why we can imagine the option of an executive mayor has been excluded .
it is for this reason that we fully support and endorse the bill before us today .
this was the ideal opportunity to cross-examine me , and ask the real questions .
as we proceed with this , we can change the types and do so for the next election .
there is no structure in our society that has the right not to be criticised .
in the second instance we joined the party to promote the development of coloured people .
it was those white liberals who moved into our district six and took our homes there .
however , we all know that that was just a matter of winning time on this issue .
they need expertise , professional support and capacity , and they also need economic opportunities .
they are getting the complaints because the problem is so big and it has to be addressed over time .
that should deal with any confusion that may have arisen in regard to that issue .
therefore , any increase in one element of the overall tax burden provokes such a serious reaction .
ratepayers see themselves paying while others do not , apparently with impunity .
the fact is that municipal service delivery has grown hugely in scope over the last five years .
ratepayers are deeply concerned about this legislation , but they are both right and wrong in this regard .
rising property rates threaten to overwhelm home-owners , especially pensioners and others living on fixed income .
firstly , the bill empowers municipalities to levy a rate on property .
secondly , the bill allows municipalities to levy different rates for different categories .
there are certain elements that can be used to the benefit of the community .
it is very interesting to note that a definite distinction is made in regard to phasing-in .
why is there not negotiation with agriculture in particular and why is agriculture not considered ?
those are the realities that they must take cognisance of and that they must take fully into account .
his message is simple : it is good , things are going well and our farm people are fine .
the physical onslaught to which agriculture is exposed cannot be allowed to continue .
however , i again wish to emphasise the impact that any form of gambling has on the community itself .
today he decided to be silent , even though he was a member of that commission .
at this stage , however , we will not commit ourselves but keep our options open .
since this has hit the news , i am sure many people are familiar with the background .
it has always been this way , and this is simply merrily going along in that same vein .
in other words , white people must keep power and privilege and wealth until all black people can be wealthy .
the minister is , in fact , on record as saying , and i quote :
once one does that , one is fundamentally undermining the rule of law .
this action is the result of a meeting which we held here on friday a week ago .
the greatest deterrent to crime and terrorism remains the likelihood of being caught , convicted and punished .
it is a history of pain and suffering and a history of little or no human rights .
at porterville , in this wonderful province , not everyone 's hair is cut at a certain hairdresser .
the milk and honey is not milk and honey for all of us .
our task now is simply to ensure that people reconcile and find one other .
never was there ever a question raised or a distinction drawn between degrees of blackness .
it is necessary that farmers , and those in the western cape specifically , should be prepared to talk things through .
the provision of social support for farm labourers , often amongst the poorest of our communities ; and
he must be charged and punished accordingly , and so must any member of society .
it seems to me as though their leaders are more concerned about the situation across the world .
i am aware of four charges of assault , of which there was a conviction in one case only .
no other tenders were called for and a formal contract was not entered into with the supplier .
decision to spend this money and they had to find a way to justify it .
they go home without receiving their medicine because of the shortage of medicine .
and making us the undisputed political choice of the majority of the people of the country .
when one has a little insight , one really ought to acquaint oneself with the facts .
he boasted beforehand that he would do well , but he was defeated and destroyed .
at the root of this racism is the social and economic position of people in this country .
the emphasis will be on making our work produce a tangible and visible result .
he is on record as having said that these two things are not related .
the safety of our people who have to use public transport is close to my heart .
sport is therefore an important weapon in our quest to improve the lives of our citizens .
the provincial government will give the guidance required and provide support , and will also , we hope , offer financial support .
the challenge is to increase the scale of delivery to all the people of our province .
we work every day to bridge the gap between their present circumstances and their future hopes .
that ends the debate on the opening address of the premier and also the business of the day .
we will ensure that every mosque , on friday , receives a copy of this letter with an interpretation of it .
yes , we have forgiven those who tried to destroy us , even through legislation .
in any case , it is generally known that when policy and action are lacking , all that happens is complaining .
it is a simple fact that the western cape puts the other provinces in the shade by far .
i believe that we need to involve the best brain power in the province in creating new jobs .
the success of good governance is structured and measured by the close examination of these pillars .
when it comes to safety and security , we should be honest with one another and put party politics aside .
we should take hands in the fight against crime and make the western cape the best province .
it was for that reason that i was not prepared to go to that party .
their own colleague , the current national minister of defence , had to talk to them and ask what they were up to .
what is true is that funds are to be made available to the department of home affairs .
if these initiatives are realised , the people of this province will benefit greatly and enjoy prosperity as a result .
last week we had a parade of officials from the departments presenting their budgets .
it is a clear indication that they are not committed to youth development .
with cheap propaganda , people were made to demonstrate , precisely while we were listening to the national anthem .
while the choir was singing the national anthem , every one of us got goose-flesh .
with full acceptance of the disease comes a decrease in risk behaviour and changes in lifestyle .
now we are again confronted with the humiliation of unkept promises .
we must finally bring to an end the cycle of unkept promises .
the great masses of our people , in particular the workers and the students , are insisting on far-reaching change .
after all , they will not be the only ones to lose when the coalition breaks down .
i am afraid to say , however , that it is my intention to proceed .
i am therefore going to go a little way over a particular line which i would not normally cross .
to improve the quality and accessibility of services provided by the provincial government .
yesterday i looked up a speech of the president in which he said , and i quote :
i believe , and i know , it was a giant stride in the right direction for our province .
i would like to request , therefore , that they clarify this issue because , as far as i am concerned , these are conflicting statements .
why do you not accuse your government of not giving more money for the police ?
after the fourth time i granted him the fact that he had asked a real , clear question .
let them really tell us why they carried on here today like a lot of malicious members of parliament .
all i am saying is that they came there to disrupt the event .
even parliament could also meet outside cape town on occasion , because our own constitution makes that possible .
imagine giving a chairperson keeping an eye on one from behind such a compliment !
it is an old parliamentary tradition that an annual report should appear in time for the budget .
so , no matter what the percentage is , i believe we should support it .
the most important issue is that we need to fulfil our duty of promoting public participation and marketing .
they are definitely not conducive for public participation and it is something that we need to look into .
i raised it in the standing committee and i want to mention it in the house today .
the chairperson is only the channel through which the wishes of the committee are channelled to the coordinators .
this proves that there is a great need out there and that this should be looked at .
he will hear at once that they are all actively involved in this process through their departments .
he should stop trying to defend something that he knows , wilfully , he cannot defend .
nine months may be nine months , and much can be done in nine months in other respects .
it had not been done , but it was found convenient to have it put on our desks today .
the report had to be tabled in the house and the house should apply its mind .
no matter what he says about it , it should have been tabled far sooner than today .
does he think there is an even and fair distribution of money spent on cultural organisations , from his own perspective ?
we conclude the same agreements with those countries as we do with other countries in the world .
firstly , she wants to persuade the house that she is the one who asked for transformation .
they hate white people , but they forget what the national minister for the public service and administration said .
commuters were compelled to walk long distances , and there were many other results of the closure .
it was the approach of the national government and it was the approach of the provincial government .
that is a message that goes to this government , to this opposition and to the national government .
yes , i do not think we intend to outsource at this point .
i cannot understand where the hitch is , but allegations were made and investigated .
i do not find it strange that there have been allegations for which no grounds have been found .
i think it is important that that this is understood so as not to create any false expectations .
i was therefore not present in dealing with the weighting at that stage .
he will see that there is a name and telephone number on every press statement that i issue .
secondly , it is the best financially controlled province in the country .
we will be watching this matter very carefully to see what is happening in regard to this issue .
we will be able to bring in something that will be able to be used by all the people in the province .
the person was prosecuted , found guilty and was punished in the regional court of clanwilliam .
i said i did not know if he worked there or is involved there .
it can only be achieved in a context of safety and on a foundation of growing prosperity .
let me be very clear about this : i am the premier of all the people of the western cape .
the senior management of the province now broadly reflect the people of our province .
we look forward to supporting him through the budgetary process for the rest of the year .
there is one matter which i would like to deal with specifically , and which was dealt with by all four speakers .
this was agreed to between the three parties , the province , the national government and the cape town city council .
he said that i did not visit these areas in the aftermath of the tornado or the devastating fires .
the way is therefore open to amplify the existing practice by allowing a secret ballot .
to the best of my knowledge i never gave an undertaking as far as this question is concerned .
there were terrible rumours outside about it and i am glad that it has been cleared up .
the market is the market , and it tends to determine it from time to time .
we have freed ourselves politically and made a democracy , and we did so without war and revolution .
they are busy finalising the report , but owing to incorrect data they have not been able to complete it .
we are talking about the taxpayer 's money , but the taxpayer expects members to be present here .
let us not lay all the blame on this side of the house or on particular individuals .
the communities were also encouraged to assist the police in whatever way they could .
in fact , just the other day they were threatened with dismissal if they did not do something .
these are people who are doing a sterling job in protecting the poorest of our people out there .
how can he selectively identify members of the service on the one hand and ignore all the rest ?
i was privileged to attend some of the projects of this directorate that were presented in the communities .
there is ample evidence that many of the initiatives of the directorate have met with significant success in a variety of communities .
our local stars will shine brightly in a sport which is very popular among the youth of our province .
there is so little money in the department that how the money is utilised should be looked at carefully .
i think one needs to look at this type of ratio , especially if one wants to focus on development .
i think that what is missing is the political will and the right attitude to put this into effect .
that is quite correct , but that only happened in a number of cases and it was very limited .
such events will not only stimulate our economy , but also promote even greater national and provincial pride .
to achieve this goal , effective communication with all the communities of the western cape will be a greater priority .
one cannot take it amiss of people for moving to the western cape to seek a better future .
it is praiseworthy because it sets itself the goal of expanding democracy and enhancing development .
it is certainly a very ambitious target for us to extend these conditions to all schools .
above all , we will be looking to see whether there is a commensurate improvement in performance among schools that are receiving more money .
learners must understand that it is their responsibility to learn ; teachers must teach and managers must manage .
it has been very well received and will now serve as a model for similar projects in other provinces .
in fact , they said to them that these instructions had come from the national office .
one cannot alter an education system if one does not bring the main players on board .
that did not happen ; in other words , the gap that existed is getting bigger and bigger .
unfortunately , however , we need to recognise the signals that we still have a very long way to go .
the people of the community are committed to making sure that their children get a proper education .
on warm days some pupils even faint during lessons and , once again , the classes are disrupted .
this is an extremely important and difficult process because many of the schools are attached to their names .
if i think that it is offensive to ordinary human beings , i will certainly raise it with my colleagues .
i think that we should be particularly concerned about the workers who are not members of medical funds .
in the end we will sit with a well-balanced budget and corpses strewn all over the place .
they do not know that the western cape is the best-governed province in the country .
i felt that we should give it the benefit of the doubt and wait until march .
i will give full details later to show how successful we as a department have been with regard to that .
the results to date have been very positive and new organisations are becoming involved and establishing themselves in this centre .
therefore we should not go to the national government and say we should extend these grants .
adults can also easily take out their frustration or exert their power over those helpless children .
she stated that there would be a disability desk and we believe that there is one .
we tried to press her to give us her possible thoughts on the matter .
i am counting my blessings , however , and i am only too grateful for the temporary relief that we have been given .
the department of housing is in the process of finalising the regulations in respect of this act .
if the people in these informal settlements have to wait up to seven years to get a home , planning becomes imperative .
people there are renting flats that belong to the provincial housing development board .
people will not necessarily get the same land back , but they can get similar land or be compensated financially .
i also want to thank the members of the standing committee for the process that took place in scof .
i want to begin with the first point , namely the contribution of local governments to national and provincial objectives .
where we find financial problems with the municipalities , they can usually be ascribed to a number of factors .
we hope that the national minister for provincial and local government will also soon heed this request .
now , if one does not get consensus , one realises that at a much earlier stage .
i want to refer to a few other matters on which they will also have to advise me .
i am not referring to the names of towns , but to the names of the new municipalities .
this is a serious matter that we are currently discussing with the national minister for provincial and local government .
i must say , however , that i think that , to a large extent , this is because we make a positive contribution and provide expertise .
one cannot function effectively with a provincial law in the absence of a national law .
people in the gallery are not allowed to participate in the proceedings of the house .
the first relates to the completion of this government 's farm worker settlement policy .
the problem has been there for more than five years , and the pace of change is somewhat slow .
our people are willing , because we have not yet had the privilege of being involved in this way .
my question is why we did not also make provision in our act for that development .
if there are any matters that require change , i will recommend it at the soonest possible opportunity .
accordingly , i would hope that this open and transparent process will silence the criticisms of culturally biased spending .
in conclusion , i am pleased that the decision-making in the allocation of funds in my budget has been reviewed .
thirdly , individuals may by the example they set influence other people with whom they come into contact .
from the outset i received all possible cooperation and assistance from them in this matter .
he is very keen to identify with the projects we have identified in the western cape .
it is going to cost the province millions to get the situation to where it should be .
accordingly , i would hope that this open and transparent process will silence the criticism of culturally biased spending .
it is with great pleasure that i participate in the debate on transport and public works .
as is the case in most countries , unemployment and poverty go hand in hand in the western cape .
is it because the coalition government is not committed to seeing improvement in our lives ?
international experience confirms that this country is on the right track with regard to its public works focus .
i am sure that we will see immediate positive effects , resulting in a decrease in road accidents .
however we must see to it that we move within the parameters of the national policy in regard to advertisements .
one of the traffic police decided one day that there were several people that he could fine .
but if i say anything here today , then it is not aimed at the national minister of transport .
if we do not support him , it will mean nothing that we passed legislation two years ago .
the time is past when people could cross the borders to register vehicles .
the days are over where companies could operate as islands in isolation from the rest of society .
i will finish as soon as possible , but i will take as long as is necessary .
i have no doubt that it will become a model for tertiary medical centres in the country .
for instance , in ireland there was a scheme by which people could invest and bring external money into ireland .
[ laughter . ] i suggest he tarries a minute before he marches down to the first floor .
in the debate on economic affairs we predominantly discussed technology and the direction it was taking .
such events will not only stimulate our economy , but also promote even greater national and provincial pride .
one cannot take it amiss of people for moving to the western cape to seek a better future .
it is praiseworthy because it sets itself the goal of expanding democracy and enhancing development .
they are crying for help and we must do our duty and stand by them in their time of need .
in the end , when he was sure that there was enough security around him , he did go outside .
when we think about the correct implementation of the legislation , we must also think of the funding involved .
this matter especially shows the necessity and importance of continued negotiations in order to try to resolve this matter .
i did not construe his words in that way , but i shall check the record if it is necessary .
it is not strong enough to carry out successful prosecutions , and there are a number of reasons for that .
the government in this province must take the full responsibility and blame for the deaths of our children .
he brought such a fine motion to the house but then he polluted the motion with his politicking .
the children were excited against discipline ; they were incited against everything there is , because everything is undermined .
the police did outstanding work but the tragedy of the matter is that all this is reactive .
the period of training has been extended from six weeks to eight weeks so that they can receive better training .
he called for a debate which differs in content with what we have before the house today .
they have been thus far in your speech , except for the last bit , and i have allowed it .
what they should do is in fact to read the full documents before they come with those quotes .
all of us had the problem of getting people who were prepared to render that service .
they are saying things here that i do not think the head council would be happy about .
let us understand where the problem came from originally and why we had to do what we had to do .
i believe we had to take a responsible decision in terms of what was good for the western cape .
it is a given that we must apply our minds and make a decision on an informed basis .
the details did not come before the committee yesterday , so they could not apply their minds to this .
if the ministers do not have the details , they are going to have to take this kind of questioning from members .
there is a budget , however , that does cater for overtime by officials in the department of education .
if teachers were taken out of classrooms when they were needed to be in classrooms , i will condemn it unreservedly .
i have before me a bill that has to be passed and therefore we will speak to each amount .
let us deal with that central challenge as to how to narrow the gap between rich and poor .
the provincial government and the local authorities have significant and important roles to play in improving the situation .
we really cannot think that this is the best way to address or combat crime .
if he has a problem with language , he can be helped , but the intention should be conveyed clearly .
it has for years been the desire that opportunities be created for them and their children .
the highest court in the land has exposed your lack of concern for the poor and the homeless .
some of the people he is supposed to represent fear for their lives at his hands .
let us never forget the people in the rural areas and in the far corners of our province .
he put the national department of health in a very difficult position , as well as his minister of health .
we all would say that cameras are one of the most effective methods of technology used to fight crime .
i am pleased that only two and half or three issues of concern have been raised .
i do not believe that one member of the cabinet believed that the report was good enough .
they may not have heard him , so i will speak up and repeat what he said .
the recourse of the minority in such a committee would be to get political gain out of it .
the other part is a savings on olympic projects that we were able to build more cheaply than budgeted for .
if we , the opposition , or anyone else , is doing that then i ask that that be stopped .
all i am asking is that we are not found guilty of participation in this tomorrow .
we warned about this through a memorandum of approximately three pages setting out what had to be done .
it asks them to make submissions , concrete submissions , that will take us forward in finding solutions .
the children are suffering ; they stand in rows until midday trying to get to school .
at the end of the day the children and the teachers are going to be judged as not having performed .
i think he should elucidate and say in what way i have misled this house .
i am waiting , and i am pushing this issue , until there is no more time to negotiate .
we are investing , and whether this province has the power to invest is a serious question .
it should have been tabled like the other amendments , if there was an additional amendment .
i shall mention no names , but they appealed for an adjournment so that they could go and caucus .
in fact , they must strengthen the capacity of municipalities to manage their own affairs .
i now turn to the legislative and executive powers of a municipality , which are vested in the municipal council .
it is in accordance with the national and provincial constitutions and the local government : municipal structures act .
there is no way in which power vested in one person can comply with this requirement .
we understand that and we shall see how we can manage it in future without the executive mayor .
i believe , and i think the national constitution allows this , that no one is above criticism .
what should be done by the ordinary person whose hope depends on the judgment of the court ?
these are uncontested facts ; we are simply putting the politics on the table here .
in the house here today those two nations have no intention of coming together .
she would jealously protect the right to put food on the tables of the poor .
she would fight jealously , with her whole being , to make sure that transformation happened in this country .
there is a very real reason , in fact an explanation , for why they have not come up with solutions .
but what did the people across the road on the other side who paid the same rates get ?
if ever i have heard something that is particularly unfair and inequitable , that must be it .
one cannot always say that the whole act is bad or that the whole act is good .
in the meantime it is important , particularly for the elderly , to take all possible steps to ensure their safety .
we could perform the exercise but in my opinion no intellectual value could be attached to it .
i also want to tell him that for once he should speak openly about murders of farmers .
no , sir , i spoke about " a peanut gallery " , which obviously is not represented here .
we will not tolerate any form of illegal operations and will continue to close them down .
he forgets that that municipality came into being during the time when he was the responsible minister .
he is there in his capacity as a member of the executive council , representing the provincial government .
we are highly suspicious of his participation on that board and his insistence on remaining there .
it was decided that it did not pose a conflict of interest and he could go on .
what raises our suspicions is the fact that we asked for the debate and the debate was postponed .
when they could not cancel the debate , they tried to put in as few speakers as possible .
if there is nothing of the kind , then the time has now come to put it in place .
somebody takes charge and keeps the situation under control , and will put people in strategic places .
the house must condemn in the strongest terms the most recent bomb blast and all the explosions that preceded it .
i have only mentioned certain instances and i do not for a moment wish to contend that the list is complete .
if there are not many blacks sitting there , it is the electorate who spoke , not us .
she could not rise to the occasion , embarrassing even her own members there .
and there , he said , we thought we were arriving in the land of milk and honey .
ultimately that is exactly what the house must do if they want to take a stand against racism and assaults .
people who are guilty of these crimes must not expect any support from me or my department .
in george and knysna there has not been a single case of evictions or assaults over the past year .
every year before an election they start with that , and when the election is past , they are dead quiet about it .
indeed , the whole intention of using public servants for this exercise was to save the taxpayer money .
i am sure he is very embarrassed about it , but i do so publicly .
we believe that it is our responsibility to build up the society that was destroyed by apartheid .
there was international interest , so it is essential that we interpret the constitutional court 's judgment correctly .
if there is nothing to hide , why is the whole truth not revealed ?
but i am prepared to acknowledge what they did to the indigenous people of this country .
this is the only way in which our audiences will be truly representative of the people of the western cape .
i call on the opposition to work with me to cross the divides .
the tragedy of the poor people on the cape flats is that they accept what is abnormal as normal .
i want to thank the newlands management officially for allowing that match to take place at newlands .
the time has arrived that his counterpart at national level should wake up and provide leadership in this regard .
the voters gave them a thorough hiding because they cannot trust the opposition with government .
the knowledge of workers should be appreciated , and there should be more investment in their expertise and skills .
i want to ask him whether a member of his family , probably his dad , was a policeman .
they played a very important role and they will play a very important role in future .
they will put it in her file and it will be reflected that there was an investigation against her .
i also agree that we cannot build the future on the bitterness of the past .
it is said about division that , a house divided cannot stand .
i think the opposition deserves a pat on its back for the way in which it keeps the coalition government on its toes .
lastly , in other provinces there are offices on the status of women in the premier 's office .
we recognise that an effective opposition is one of the most important elements of an effective government and democracy .
living in squatter camps aggravates the problem and makes combating the disease infinitely more difficult .
our bill on equity ensures that the dignity of our people is guaranteed and for that we are grateful .
we hear that they have a problem with the fact that support is to be given .
when communities rise against offenders , it signals that ordinary people are prepared to identify offenders .
this racism is a blight on this province and we will not stop until it has been eradicated .
we can use political arguments to good effect , without smearing one another with personal allegations .
i will fight , along with my party , until we are able to say comfortably that this scourge has been eradicated .
when will our colleagues learn that negative politics destroys the very soul of a community and a nation ?
on the farms , one sees that the farmers still always separate the coloured workers and the black workers .
i have no problem with the principle of the legislation contained in the act .
the industry that suffers most under this sort of legislation is agriculture and employment in agriculture .
to bind the province , as the gateway to africa , ever stronger to the country and the continent .
we must wipe out the scourge of unemployment by adhering to sound economic principles and fiscal discipline .
her head had to roll because she is an embarrassment to the province and an embarrassment to the government .
perhaps it is because the coalition government does not have enough people to attend the standing committees .
the greatest attraction is that no bureaucracy will have to be created to obtain this tax .
i am pleading with hon members that scof should not be used as a process where they intimidate the officials .
i accept the principle and i will see to it that it is carried out to the best of my ability .
by taking cabinet to the people , we involve our people in the running of our province .
existing structures are reviewed whilst responsibility for reform is vested in each executing authority , head of department and senior manager .
this will seriously hamper our best efforts to do justice to the previously disadvantaged communities in particular .
when there is a lack of discipline it provides a weak foundation on which to build our future .
however its most important function is to provide strategic guidance on labour relations within the administration as a whole .
this year we have more money and now they say they do not have a plan for this money .
i am only too aware that as far as public awareness and participation are concerned , we have not done enough .
this requires an appropriate allocation by the executive , understanding the role of the provincial parliament .
why are the powers of committees circumscribed in this manner ?
i now turn to another constraint , and that is the inadequate resources allocated to committees .
it is , therefore , clear that they want to know what is happening and how people want to vote .
i finished off my answer to this question by saying that this matter is going to come to scof .
we have received no written replies to the questions for written reply that appeared on the order paper .
i should like to propose that when we draw up our budget next year , we take this into account .
on his return he distanced himself from the other farm residents and was known as a loner .
we have now heard that report , but when we visited the place the reality appeared to be very different .
our way is the way that we have been doing it for the last two and a half years .
that is what the report said and i am very confident that that was indeed the case .
let us be honest , let us go to the president and tell him that the national minister simply makes promises .
that will also be looking at raising fees from applications to assist with the capacity .
i have received the report of a committee member , because he no longer knows what to do .
i also have a summarised version that will take me about four to five minutes to read .
of course , there is much to be done in this dynamic process , and significant challenges remain ahead .
it also means that somebody has been paid that amount of money for kilometres that were actually not recorded .
these amounts have to be prescribed by regulations promulgated by the national government in terms of the act .
the chair is not going to give a ruling as to which questions are permitted and which are not permitted .
the second aspect is to work out strategic models for poverty eradication in the long term .
and i do not know what he is being paid there , but i will find out if he is working there .
the bombings have ceased , although we remain vigilant and ready to act at all times .
economic development is one area in which cooperation with the city of cape town can reap important results for all of us .
i understand the problems that there have been , and the department explained extensively how these problems have arisen .
therefore , when one looks at the overall amount , i do not believe it to be particularly serious .
people have become so desperate that pregnant women come to the western cape to have their babies here .
one also has to take into account that the residents of macassar have suffered many times in the past .
the rest was spent on items not directly related to vandalism , for example , burst underground pipes .
but we cannot ignore the past when moving into the future , as aspirations feed off injustices .
the randlords and centuries of enrichment by a small group of whites , to him , is neither here nor there .
a free port is a special type of free zone , namely a free zone that is situated in a harbour area .
the point is that we must have legislation in place so that we can proceed to implement the policy .
that is something which i do not appreciate because i do not think it is fair and reasonable .
it is widely accepted that the fight against crime will not be successful purely through the application of laws .
all these matters will assist in realising the strategic objectives of the department , which are the following :
to bring about specific improvements to ensure better service delivery based on the results of these studies .
i find it significant that many of the projects that we do are then replicated in other provinces .
one cannot keep promising the community that one is going to war and then nothing happens .
they can also be prevented from using the equipment in normal police stations in terms of their rather limited mandate .
it was an innovative idea and it is something we need to progress with and work on .
i am very pleased that he is saying that because , unfortunately , it is not what we are hearing on the ground .
it is good that he now has the means to do the necessary transformation in this province .
the organisation is beset by problems , as not all schools in the region have been brought into the structures .
had it not been for them , we should not have achieved success in the various sports .
one such event at which millions of rand will change hands is due to hit the city this weekend .
i want to thank her for what she has done for the province during the time she has been here .
if a person is caught without a licence then he must be prohibited from applying for it again for a year .
however , i am convinced that tourism is the economic anchor of this province and will also determine our economic growth .
together we can put a shine on that jewel to beam an international message of success , prosperity , harmony and peace .
principals and staff in schools , many of whom do extraordinarily well under very difficult circumstances , must share in this triumph .
although the issuing of this equipment will be a daunting and expensive task , it will be the easy part .
they have developed an excellent manual for this purpose which is proving to be a superb resource for all schools .
however , there is a counterposition which states that attempting to do too much can result in massive failure .
by virtue of that , it is not laudable for the department to recommend books that we cannot underwrite .
this , however , requires the support of the entire community , and not only the support of parents of learners .
change is not about visiting schools , but about clear policies on redress for the disadvantaged schools .
last night was the last time i discussed the issue with him and what is happening .
on the national norms and standards , we have conceded that the outcome of this process was not ideal .
he says that there is no transformation in the province and that everything is due to national initiatives .
she is quite right that the national norms and standards placed far too much emphasis on physical facilities .
i also agree with her that it is overcrowded and i am concerned about the shortage of benches .
permit me to mention a few other examples of how we are planning to manage more effectively .
it is incredible to see what people have done there with private money and how it has been overhauled .
i would like to acknowledge that they have achieved a number of benefits in the good work that they are continuing to perform .
in fact , the statistics show that the figures are considerably higher than the other provinces .
unless central government makes additional funds available to mount an effective battle against aids , we are doomed .
the advantage of a special desk of this kind is that it helps to keep the focus on important aspects .
if it falls outside of what the department has decided a farm should look like , that is also fine .
we need to see that there is value for the money that is going in , because it is a lot of money .
she was unable to deliver in the portfolios of women , the youth and the disabled .
if we can subsidise housing loans to civil servants , why can we not subsidise loans to business and create jobs ?
it is a great pleasure to work with the department and the former minister of that department .
for two years absolutely nothing has been done by this provincial government to address the chaos which exists .
if he is not aware of it , i request him to have the situation there investigated .
he said that he was not going to talk about the matter again , so let me now explain it to him finally .
this is a programme that is being managed outstandingly well in this province and of which we can be very proud .
an aspect which is closely related to the powers and competencies of municipalities is the matter of what is to happen to the staff .
in answer to every single request he has made , his own party have slapped him in the face .
in this regard we believe that consumers are going to have to learn to pay for the services they demand and use .
without getting personal , i want to ask him one question : who was the responsible minister at that stage ?
the regulations were advertised and a wide range of comments received , and these have been carefully considered by the department .
the potential implications of the development of virtually the whole of the province 's coastline therefore need to be carefully considered .
it is our intention that this process be completed throughout the province by the end of the year .
they are people of outstanding calibre and they need our support in a very difficult and technical process .
it is rather disappointing , though , that development has always been beyond the reach of our inhabitants , especially those of colour .
i forget who said that i did not allow the presentation to take place .
my departmental officials will know that i sat them down in my office and went through the list .
i venture to suggest that most of the land use planning ordinance is unconstitutional , and that concerns me .
one of the most pressing problems confronting the professional arts in the western cape is financial survival .
it would be interesting to see the functioning of the commission once it comes into existence .
we should not simply assume that changes will automatically take place overnight ; it must be worked at .
the culture of hand-outs has made thousands of underprivileged people , especially single women , totally dependent on the state .
going through the document made me wonder about the funding and the criteria that are applied .
were these amounts given to them in cash , or were they actually provided in the form of a cheque ?
i hope that with the cooperation of the people of the western cape we shall build and grow and develop .
i wish to give him the assurance that i shall join him in fighting for more funds .
for many years we cooperated closely when i was chairperson of general provincial services in the province .
now we are faced with the problem that the national government wants to begin implementing this legislation piecemeal in the province .
it is clear that the coalition government and the department regard the role of the state as merely a neutral one .
transport always seems to end up at the back of the queue when it comes to handing out money .
there is no way that they can turn round and say that their government is committed to helping the poor .
we are talking about it now and we undertake that there will be sufficient liaison with and consultation of the people .
some of them are not adhering to that , and that is why we have our officers on the roads .
we have a relatively well-trained labour force , but not nearly as well-trained as it should be .
the board acknowledges this and has put in place a strategic plan to ensure that it retains the competitive edge .
various options are being investigated in george , while the option of utilising own accommodation in worcester is also being investigated .
moreover , in the past month or two the rand has not done well against the dollar and the pound .
i want to highlight another issue that i raised in scof , and that concerns the informal traders .
there is a new set of incentives that is being prepared by the national government which will come up shortly .
we therefore have to develop other skills , and i think that at this stage this stands us in good stead .
there are many officials in my department who work very hard to whom i have not accorded recognition today .
i like a good battle , and may the economy , through all of this , thrive in the year to come .
the farmers of the overseas market where they have to compete are living in luxury from the subsidies they receive .
they were requested by the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling , and they were not submitted then .
this will lead to an even greater boost in quality of life in our province , which i referred to earlier .
if a person is caught without a licence then he must be prohibited from applying for it again for a year .
however , i am convinced that tourism is the economic anchor of this province and will also determine our economic growth .
together we can put a shine on that jewel to beam an international message of success , prosperity , harmony and peace .
we shall continue to organise in our community as if , in passing , there is no minister .
simply their presence in our country give our forces the right to shoot to kill .
the province shifts it to the national government , and the national government shifts it to the province .
so many groups have taken to the streets to protest against the violence and against children being abused .
and he did not realise that he was destroying the social fabric of our people .
but it is easier to tackle urban terrorists than it is to tackle gang members .
it has been proved by an independent report that they were not racist and that they acted correctly .
what do the provincial government and members of the house on the opposite side actually say and do ?
sir , at that time service was not rendered to communities as the public required .
and then the onus rested on the provinces , and the western cape province undertook to do its share .
if the opposition tells me that they are not interested , then i say that they are guilty of high treason .
if this is going to be the response from all the ministers , we are going to have a great problem in the house .
the moneys were contributions from the various line function ministries towards one fund for the purpose of registering voters .
the leader of the house is , in fact , correct and i would respectfully ask you to reconsider your decision .
did he have the figures at the time when he approved this and did he apply his mind to it ?
i have no reason to believe that the figure given to me is not correct .
i cannot give it back to central government ; it is a saving which i must utilise somewhere .
he said to me that the full amount was reimbursed to the department of education by the provincial treasury .
what i am not clear about and what i cannot answer i will not try to answer .
however , i have asked for that information to be checked and i will supply the house with the full details .
if i find that teachers were involved i will make a statement in the house condemning it .
every programme we devise must explicitly seek to narrow the gap between rich and poor .
it is this feeling that drives me when i am full of confidence in tackling the challenge that faces me .
it is a syndrome of blaming everyone except himself and maintaining that everyone except he has a role to play .
we can no longer say that we are still waiting for the provincial commissioner of police ; he has been appointed .
why is he touched by this issue , and why does he see the need to defend his position ?
the fact of the matter is that the majority of people in the city live in the south-east .
this is a beautiful province of ours , but we know that the poor are having a bad time .
that i believe requires a ruling , because it might leave the house with a very unfortunate perception .
hordes of people lost their jobs as a result of this same person who intervened in these problems .
they are content that they can continue to build their prosperity and welfare on the misery of others .
that was to be their accommodation for the three weeks that they were supposed to work on the farm .
i believe it is because there is such a strong counter-force against this despite our best efforts .
we believe that this needs considerable further clarification and a policy framework put before the house .
i think it shows that these funds can again be ploughed back into the departments and into our own areas .
it seems that that money needs to be held onto very tightly and that is why that cannot happen .
we take money from them and we give it straight back to them in the form of cameras .
i should like to indicate in chronological order everything that has been done to contain the violence .
that was a very tragic period and has left scars that still erupt from time to time today .
on the contrary , it affords one the opportunity to convince others of what is right and morally acceptable .
whether we like it or not , those are the constituencies that have voted for us in overwhelming numbers .
we are dealing with a debate in which feelings are running high and for that reason the chair must certainly deal with these matters .
i said immediately that we would advertise in the course of this week and go through the process .
it was indicated that there would be an amendment to be dealt with in the committee of the whole house .
it can then be put to the vote ; otherwise we could just end up discussing this matter over and over .
the standing committee on public accounts , having heard and considered evidence on certain aspects included in the -
i know what his decision is based on because i was part of the committee when the decision was taken .
she will regard every man that she meets in the community as having similar intentions towards her .
the majority of the people in this city paid rates , but they were not represented in any councils .
where does the argument come from that certain areas did not do their bit and never made a contribution ?
it is of particular importance to check on the identity and , where possible , the background of employees .
i do not wish the standard of this debate to decline any further and therefore i shall not dwell on this point any longer .
i might just say on that score that the province has not budgeted for this particular income .
some of them had an interest in this decision and they did not actually follow the rules .
the voters are turning their backs on the people on the other side of the house .
i acted on what the civic association of that area has asked me to do .
because of the context in which it was used i did not stop the debate to correct it .
the intelligency is not getting to the minister , or else the right intelligence is not being conveyed to him .
it is no use carrying on like this , because every second or third week a bomb explodes .
the defence , the state and we here , too , are doing everything we can to defend our client , democracy .
the defence goes on to argue that there is indeed a guilty party but it is definitely not the poor innocent young fellow , democracy .
while they are exploding , certain people are linked to them , but nothing seems to be done to them .
this is not a time when we should betray that trust with inconsistencies in our behaviour and utterances .
at the same time , additional capacity from the office of the national commissioner , as well as other provinces , was deployed in the western cape .
i come from nowhere other than africa and i can be at home nowhere else but in africa .
if he is , the house is asking organised agriculture in the western cape to expel the farmer from the organisation .
it appears to me they are unaware that the lot of the farm people in the western cape has not improved much .
are we prepared to call on organised agriculture to discipline members who may be involved ?
the prescribed fee must be negotiated and agreed to by the head of the provincial department purchasing the service .
he went the extra mile in order to find the information we needed in the house .
yesterday i quoted the figure that we had during that period of going this route .
governments cannot pick and choose the areas of responsibility they wish to accept and ignore the rest .
just recently , about two months ago , i was approached at a cocktail party by one of the councillors from goodwood .
he is sick in bed and he is hoping to be able to be here tomorrow .
there are allegations against the very person that we warned him of and who became the traffic chief .
i do , however , call upon the opposition not to engage in opposition which obstructs service delivery .
i was there a few weeks ago , because some people wanted to move a school from one area to another .
i am ashamed to say that just the stench in the area drove me out of the place .
the existence of this kind of squalor and poverty is nothing to be proud of in this province .
i hope that when he makes his speech he will talk about the causes of crime and so on .
anybody who believes that one can separate the two really does not know what he / she is talking about at all .
they want to make the western cape an island , entrenching the perception that white is good and black is bad .
they said that everything was fine in education and that it was fine in the western cape .
we have therefore identified this year as the year to concentrate on sustainable rural development and urban renewal .
before i get to that , let me first make my contribution to the debate on the premier 's opening address .
in cases in which they did not perform , i cannot point a finger at any of them .
it is a very dangerous situation for them to be in because they could be mugged or kidnapped .
they ensured that there was a stable transition of local government in the period when there were no councillors .
therefore calls on the premier to ensure that the committee meets as a matter of urgency .
i know that he struggled with bookkeeping , but now it seems that he struggles to count as well .
it means that i can go to sleep at night in the comforting knowledge that i am doing something right .
in my opening address i did not divide the people of our province into categories , classes , races or groups .
the woman who took her son there saw the principal , and the principal had a scarf on .
that was in the years of apartheid and there were no problems on the staff at that school .
i cannot help but ask myself two questions : firstly , who is our real enemy ?
i think that the high ethical and moral standards which he represents should serve as an example to us all .
unfortunately , until now the opposition has preferred to play the man and not the ball .
if the social aspect is not well catered for , it will give rise to numerous social problems .
i remember that at some stage we in the provincial parliament took the matter to the constitutional court .
why are beaches reserved for only certain sections of the population and why do some have to pay and others not ?
i wish he would tell the poor people that , because he kept on mentioning the poor .
racist remarks , whether they are done for a good or a bad purpose , remain bad and in poor taste .
the official report gave the cause of the fire as children trying to cook food .
this technique does not contribute to the promotion of good cooperation among the various groups in this house .
they are only interested in grabbing everything , and they use democracy only when it suits them .
they are not interested in falling in with a decision of the majority of voters .
we are going to register them so that they pay their taxes ; so that they know that they are part of an organised organisation .
i was on one of the boards and i can exactly guarantee what is being done with the money .
i would personally go with her to that shop owner to make sure that the complaint was properly lodged .
that family had to experience the hard reality of racism and discrimination in this wonderful province for a third time .
there is a direct relationship between agriculture and the level of prosperity experienced by our people in the rural areas .
i repeat that today , but i also expect it of my colleagues on the other side of the house .
that is how important their assertion is that i am incompetent and that i should resign my position .
our challenge , therefore , is to target service delivery to that sector of the population that could reap direct benefits from this .
i sincerely hope that it has helped lift the veil of perceived secrecy in the compilation of the provincial budget .
we not only have human resources ; we have financial resources and institutions that other provinces do not have .
i believe that because we have subscribed to that notion of fiscal discipline , the budget is worthy of being supported .
i give this house the assurance that no miracle can be included in respect of those lists .
i do not have much to say about his speech other than to thank him for his cooperative attitude .
however , the few positive examples point to the upliftment of communities by way of knowledge , training and opportunities .
obviously we realise that we have not reached the peak yet , but we have come a very long way .
we cannot wait for the national government to work on issues before we can start our own work .
i doubt whether they are serious now , but i would like to give them the benefit of the doubt .
they have got to go and pay for it and they have got to queue , because they did not get it .
i am just saying that if they are genuine about working with us , they will be able to do so .
guilty members should , therefore , be warned that they may very soon find that their cash flows are severely affected .
over the years , scof has had to do an increasing amount of work regarding the budget and the other standing committees a reduced amount .
at the middle and towards the lower level we will find that it remains coloured and african .
however , with the fine-tuning of the needs of the provincial parliament , we seem only able to fill five new posts .
this would mean that scof would not have the tremendous workload and responsibility that it currently has to carry .
the other side was given none of the opportunities that the objectors had in this process .
we need the exposure , not only to cultures , but to investment from other parts of the world .t
there are many , many civil servants in the province who have come in here and attempted to work in this administration .
this does not mean dealing with the symptoms , but dealing with the issues permanently .
in fact , in some cases we have just replaced contractors and in other cases we have kept the schools open .
it has not been a completely smooth process by any means , but we are aware of the problems where they exist and we are dealing with them .
those objections are all gone into very carefully and a resolution is sought in the end that will satisfy everybody .
however , at the moment there is a shortage of human resources and they cannot put it there straight away .
i have no intention of approving a law that i know will cause certain problems .
we are talking about something like two and a half to three years ago , if i remember correctly .
the letter to which he refers was sent to him before the complaints were submitted to the national department .
i think that the questioner has used the wrong words and quoted the incorrect words on the programme .
it is very difficult to coordinate and it will be made available to the hon member on receipt thereof .
i am such a big winner , so why should i still fill in a form stating how to win .
governments cannot pick and choose the areas of responsibility they wish to accept and ignore the rest .
the purpose is to market tourism and the produce of our province in the union and elsewhere overseas .
later i began to wonder when we would reach the rougher parts of the road , but it remained smooth .
i intend attending their meetings later on today for as long as i possibly can .
sir , it is clear confirmation of the fact that their cohorts are nothing more than political delinquents .
it is shocking that it has taken almost four months for us to only now receive a report on this .
in terms of the municipal ordinance , there are various taxes that can be levied , and i can mention a few of them .
most municipalities use only a general tax within the jurisdictions of those specific municipalities .
the office has also been relocated to make it more accessible and convenient for staff and members of the public .
one does not need to be an astrophysicist to work out and remember who that is !
indeed , the national treasury proved its true colours when it hijacked the tax on international departures for itself .
that , to me , is even worse , but i am not going to surrender my dignity by trying to expose that .
and then you come and repeat the allegations here , without evidence , knowing that they are not true .
i thank him for his support , especially the compliments he paid to the officials , which are much appreciated .
and do we have the will to go to war on the one to achieve peace and prosperity ?
because we have a responsibility as a government , it is not enough for us to merely mobilise the community .
it is very heartening to take note of the decreases in the crime rate where they have been most operational .
all these programmes and projects will seek to enhance the quality of life of the people of the western cape .
a harder and more dedicated worker will be hard to find anywhere in this provincial administration .
i also wish to express my personal thanks to her for the way in which she has helped me in my task .
in other words , they are unpaid officials who serve in clubs and federations for the love of the sport .
it is also frustrating just to talk and talk about this every time , but we see no movement .
these are all very noble ideas and we would really like to see them come to fruition in this year .
if people do not want to make themselves available for sport , one cannot force them to do so .
never before in the history of this country has the future held greater promise for all its people .
this status will enable us to participate in future programmes of the committees of the assembly .
when all is said and done , they are our people , we do represent them , so come along and give us a hand .
once again the new year has brought horrifying road deaths , despite the many campaigns against drunk driving and the high fines for speedsters .
our challenge is to ensure that good schools remain excellent , while weak schools dramatically improve their performance .
firstly , we have to understand all the reasons for poor performance , and we have to define the problem accurately and honestly .
many of our schools are doing so and can compete with the best schools in the world .
if we could get this right , we would effect substantial savings and allow the available resources to go much further .
this collaborative effort should be driven by a shared vision and joint ownership , otherwise it cannot succeed .
according to predictions it is expected that thousands of young people may die of the results of aids in the next few years .
there are only two buses that have to transport the first lot and then they only come with the second lot .
is that because there is a lack of emphasis on education for learners from previously disadvantaged communities or not ?
secondly , on the question of the falsified reports , i certainly have kept the national minister of education informed .
the trend towards private education has been a trend throughout africa and in many other parts of the world .
we protested to the national councils and the national ministry , but that made no difference whatsoever .
as far as effective and efficient management is concerned , what we are now focusing on is " working smarter " throughout the branch : health .
of course there are still serious problems in health care here , and i might mention just four in particular .
our standing committees have not seen any legislation , and what will happen when the next batch of needles is found ?
i have a problem with that part of our budgetary system , because this department has always needed more money .
i think we need to continue to speed up the process throughout our province so that people can get back what was rightfully theirs .
people prefer to stay in their shacks rather than move into houses built by such developers .
he should also realise that if that date had elapsed , he would have dispossessed thousands of people on the cape flats .
i am aware of the fact that there are people who own large properties , rent them and live there at ridiculous prices .
i therefore wish to thank the officials for their hard work and the extra hours that they put in in that division .
what he has done , is exactly what we have seen and measuring him against as he went along .
what is our vision for service delivery in this province , and how are we going to govern this province ?
i think that would lower the tone of this debate , precisely when we are in the process of building municipalities up .
what i can certainly say is that our officials and the councils are making serious efforts to extend services further .
there is too little money given to local government for its responsibility to render an effective service .
i think it would be difficult for the house to bind the particular minister to this at this point .
these regulations have now been considered by the relevant standing committee and should be promulgated in the provincial gazette shortly .
the next part of my speech deals with the building of capacity within local government in respect of integrated development planning .
there is certainly a connection as far as local government is concerned and i think that that has to be taken into consideration .
as far as development is concerned , i am not saying that we should take existing rights away from developers or different owners of property .
to me it is a question of " damned if you do and damned if you do not " .
firstly , it may be an organised endeavour by some central body to involve people .
perhaps his head and my head are still clear enough to bring this matter to a new solution .
i am also keen to see arts such as ballet , opera and orchestra managed by one entity .
i think it will work much better and i am committed to seeing the survival of these art forms .
if they know that very little has been done in this regard , they are going to be very disappointed and will pull out .
the layout of that floor is not attractive and we as a province can only be the losers financially .
the main difference is that there are stark differences across the racial groups in levels of poverty and unemployment .
the national government will also have to realise that they have contributed directly to the situation in which we find ourselves today .
i myself am disappointed , as i also said this morning , that we have not moved more rapidly in this regard .
i find it unacceptable that we are now speaking about what should happen in the first half of next year .
he made a wonderful statement , and i want to ask him please not to make that statement again .
if we look at it correctly , and we think of the damage done to our roads by the trucks , it is small change .
a motion has a certain format and i no longer see the format in the wording of the motions .
if an objection to a motion is recorded , the objection is not necessarily to the content of the motion .
that is precisely what it is , and it is not necessarily the case that there is objection to the contents of the motion .
for that reason it is important that this intellectual partnership is aimed at increasing the speed of decision-making within the government .
those are critical elements that also have an economic dimension , but i will not be saying too much about them .
in other words , one finds that various components of one product are manufactured in different parts of the world .
in this one they should start focussing on the issues which i addressed at the beginning of my speech .
the first point on which i wish to elaborate has to do with the current factors in the agricultural sector that must be taken into account .
in order to accelerate the settlement of new farmers , i believe we should learn from the experience of other african countries .
i would also like to convey my thanks to the department of agriculture for the hard work that they do .
they have not succeeded one hundred per cent in making a farmer of me , but hopefully we are getting there slowly .
those houses are now becoming a burden on the farm and accordingly no new houses are being built and old houses are being demolished .
the budget is very quiet about the inequalities that exist between men and women on farms and in the agricultural sector .
does it mean that there is a move away from rural upliftment and rural development to further important aspects such as services en engineering services ?
when a house is vacated , they would now prefer to demolish it than to place other inhabitants in the house .
if we do not consider what is important for our workers and our own people , then the future is bleak .
why can that school not be converted into an agricultural school where the pupils learn the basic subjects of agriculture ?
it was cause for concern to me that in his opening address the president did not say a word about agriculture .
i challenge the other provinces : let us see which province has settled the most successful farmers after five years .
never before in the history of this country has the future held greater promise for all its people .
this status will enable us to participate in future programmes of the committees of the assembly .
when all is said and done , they are our people , we do represent them , so come along and give us a hand .
once again the new year has brought horrifying road deaths , despite the many campaigns against drunk driving and the high fines for speedsters .
if the government had had eyes to see and ears to hear , this problem could have been avoided .
however , and this is the point i wish to make , nothing stops me from giving prior notice .
our courts interpret that as meaning murderers cannot be hanged , they have a right to life .
that is the fact that our prisons have become part of the problem instead of part of the solution .
one is not going to resolve the community problem until one actually resolves the situation within the prison .
and now that they have fallen off the tiger and the tiger has begun to gnaw at them , they blame apartheid for everything .
at the moment there is a tendency to give them a bigger role in the security of the country .
the call was to all the public servants to go the extra mile and do community service on a voluntary basis .
he acted in a fair manner and knew full well what we were doing when he was appointed .
the question before the house that we are discussing is whether we can authorise this unauthorised expenditure .
i do not have the information at hand on how many officials were involved and in which way they were compensated .
i had called him out as i needed to know that from him , and that was the information i received .
i have a motion to move and i am asking whether you will allow the moving of motions .
this also means that those who received services and to whom help is given must be accorded the necessary empathy .
i invite everyone to make me aware of the problems that i may not yet be aware of .
when i tell that story , it casts considerable suspicion on the story of leaders that we can believe in .
we must at all times keep a cool head and exchange ideas with the aim of combating that sphere of violence .
still less does this allow for creating opportunities for farm workers and their children to promote their aspirations .
it is not the natural order of things that the western cape has a better infrastructure than the northern province .
they first give them free samples and once hooked , they charge them large sums of money .
a favourable climate for development is being created here so that opportunities can be established to improve the quality of life of all .
that is music to the ears of everyone who has the interests of rural areas at heart .
the frightening implication of that perception is that the national government will be soft on corruption .
corruption and maladministration in general is the greatest obstacle throughout the world on the road to proper economic and social development .
we have moved beyond that and we are , in fact , expanding and implementing our fully-fledged programmes .
the officials undertook to provide the house with the answers to questions which have not been answered .
an interesting point that i want to mention is that the retention of the increased self-generated revenue by departments is good .
what has happened here is that there have been unusual circumstances and in my view it should not have happened .
a court case is pending and we are keeping aside part of the money to see what happens there .
twenty days down the line we have again called for a debate to discuss the issue that we discussed extensively at that time .
the response we received at that stage did not necessarily say that they were going to sort out these problems .
i have heard numerous calls from the other side of the house that this matter should not be politicised .
who will apply is not my concern , provided they act within the parameters of the advertisements .
we identified others , but we were not given the opportunity to raise them in the standing committee .
the world is now small and cities compete with one another across the globe for both tourism and investment .
whereas there are no restrictions on municipalities ' entering into guarantees , there are on provincial governments .
it requires the agreement of a number of other bodies , but if one obtains that agreement one can enter into a guarantee .
it is very difficult for me to make a ruling if i do not have the information before me .
the convention in the house is that the chairperson of a standing committee participates in the debate after the minister .
and said that the reason we support an executive mayor is that by doing so we are giving people a choice .
they had to caucus so that they could get the one person who was in favour of our proposal , under the whip .
they did so in order to ask if we would allow further evidence to be brought before the standing committee .
the bill before us is the provincial segment of the legislative framework in which the transformation of local government must take place .
what is the minimum sentence for rape , murder and other serious crimes , and in their judgments , do they always stick to that ?
no other current hon member of this house was involved in those discussions ; not a single one of them .
if anyone does not share that principle with us we are sorry , but we cannot cooperate with him .
this is because some councils have very ambitious and sometimes very unrealistic ideas about what municipalities can and should provide .
yes , there are certain problems and those problems must be addressed and we must place them clearly on the table .
he and his pregnant wife subsequently had to sleep in the veld until someone else took them in .
it gives me pleasure to enter the debate today in support of this important piece of legislation .
in fact , i know the board has been involved in this matter on a concerted basis as well .
we have said that the post should be given to any other person who does not have the same kind of interests .
the companies ' attorneys have confirmed what the duties of a director are where the disclosure of interests is concerned .
i wish him everything of the best in his task ; may he achieve the necessary success that he wishes to achieve .
i do not think that the government is unable to stop this crime in this country .
it is a sign that we cannot walk around with the confidence that we should all be walking around with .
whether it is people who are not prosecuted for traffic offences or murderers , they get away .
they came to see us and they found out the best way to cooperate with the police .
the people who claimed rights for themselves were unfortunately white and the people who were deprived of rights were blacks .
discrimination is discrimination , wherever it is found , and it is equally objectionable wherever it is found .
up till now , to a large extent the debate on race in the western cape has been focused on the coloured communities .
we are asking them to determine whether this albertinia farmer is a member of organised agriculture in the western cape .
the community must step forward and try to catch the offenders so that the law can take its full course .
the greatest degree of consultation and cooperation is required , and in this case clearly forthcoming from organised agriculture .
what is in question is the ultimate logic that therefore they believed that the money had been accounted for .
if this is not creating division where unity can be built , tell me what it is .
this is often reflected when we listen to people at braais , in shops , in meetings and in the street .
clearly , what these learned people are trying to say is that we need to address the issues that cause racialism in this country .
they do not think there is anything wrong if people shoot at one another from one side to the other .
our friends across the floor will have to pull their weight if they want to prove that they are serious .
with regard to the cleaning up and beautification of our province , and welcoming visitors to it , the department of transport will do its part .
the very young boys and girls who should be playing some form of sport are now committing all forms of crime .
to improve the quality and accessibility of service provided by the provincial government is another objective .
i think we should try to get through to the communities , even if only to a limited extent .
in not one case was it really necessary to implement the lot system at a municipality .
they complain because they cannot participate , because there are not enough offices available , and for all the associated reasons .
they will not be capable of delivering where they should deliver , because they do not want to participate .
i gained the impression that they thought that because they were in the minority , they could not make any contribution .
in my address i said i was proud of my team and our delivery to all the people .
the purpose was to show that this government is truly a government for all the people of the western cape .
but , sir , the poor , the neglected , the disadvantaged need much more to restore their humanity and their dignity .
the provincial government and the standing committees need to go out to the people and show them that we really care .
his diligent and industrious approach to this important portfolio does not go by unseen , and that with a limited budget .
the former minister and i had plans to draw up ideas on how we are going to work those things out .
it is indeed one of the best and loveliest regions of the world , one of which we can be rightly proud .
it is a fact that the coalition government has not lifted a finger in terms of service delivery to our people .
they have only put the rosy issues on the table , as though those are the issues that are making people panic .
he is not supposed to be leading a minority , but to be the premier of the whole province .
but one of the issues high on our list of priorities is to generate more own income .
unfortunately , our experience indicates that we cannot say that about all legislation created recently .
to maintain and improve the physical infrastructure required for the development of this province .
in our attempts to impose fiscal discipline , let me summarise the position as follows :
however , now that our basic fiscal framework is falling into place , clear direction and priorities now need to be set and delivered upon .
we from the western cape know from the fires that we have experienced just how good these pilots really are .
the committee supports the initiative of the department to work towards a coordinated approach to fire fighting by all municipalities .
firstly , after five years of severe cuts it seeks to stabilise the delivery of social services in this province .
i am pleased to hear that the opposition is not disregarding the committee 's report , but is agreeing with it .
in future it will be necessary to think far more creatively to ensure that we improve on this .
indeed , it is true that investors have confidence in the government of the western cape because the western cape is well managed .
we would also like to put on record that corruption should be fought wherever it rears its head .
we believe that we are not fulfilling our role regarding safety and security and eradicating crime in this province .
on the contrary , an element that is missing in our budget is the lack of political will to stretch the inadequate budget .
as much as i regard it as a feather in my cap , i know that they would not like to believe that .
unfortunately , after the cake has been cut , i do not even have crumbs left to use for other purposes .
but the idea of the exercise is to exchange constructive ideas , not to stimulate a political slanging-match .
i believe that the same applies to all of us in this house and everyone in the province who is responsible for this .
if none , then i would like to remind the house that their rights are seriously violated in terms of the constitution of the country .
it is the criminal who can get away with murder , not only on our streets , but in our administration as well .
we have one question , which we believe is critical , to do with the budget of the office of the premier .
the point i am making is , it is their province and it is my province ; we must make it work here .
the committee supports the initiative of the department to work towards a co-ordinated approach to fire fighting by all municipalities .
i would just have done so earlier in the speech , because after that she would not have been able to chastise one .
we can truly be proud of the fact that we , calculated at the cost per member , are still number one in the country .
it is one thing to get the office , but it is another thing to man that office .
the report has been tabled today nine months down the line and that is far from being acceptable to the house .
is it acceptable that people should wait eight years for things which this province is directing to be implemented ?
we follow the best road and arrive at the best resolution for that community , one which we hope can satisfy everybody .
if they do not accept it as their own by-laws , then of course we are without any regulations out there .
they have cut themselves off from the outside world in a sense , and have concentrated on the outstanding application backlog .
i will not tolerate any form of discrimination , either on the grounds of race , gender or any other grounds , in my department .
these include people streaming into this province because of failing services in other provinces , largely the eastern cape .
the delays have , however , not been on my side ; the delays have been on the side of central government .
this was undertaken in partnership with the office on the status of disabled persons in the office of the president .
last year this policy was forwarded to all schools in the province , and there has been a very positive response to that .
we went to the rural areas where people could not get out because they could not afford it .
it is clear that the western cape province , with declining budgets and a growing population , faces many challenges .
we will not let these issues go ; we will remind the house and scof of those very important issues .
i think he has lasted the longest of them all , but i warn him to watch his back .
we will not stop making it work and we will deliver to the poorest of the poor .
the answer lies in the system working , and it must work effectively for the people of the community .
that is even less than the exodus at the moment , except for the past year , during which we made a big effort .
we hope that it will appear in the government gazette very soon so that we can go out there and look at the applications .
it is the intention to further decentralise accounting functions to the remaining departments over the next two to three years .
what is worse is when certain people say they will support me and then change their minds in the house .
we are talking about members who are absent during sittings and even asking how many times a member may leave the house .
you are wasting your time completely in bringing this motion and the investigation before this house .
this house has my word on it that i will come to cabinet as soon as possible after the regulations have been promulgated .
i think that it is a perfectly reasonable request , and the presentation should be made as soon as they are able to do so .
we do appreciate the enormous constraints under which they work , and also their time and effort with the various departments .
it is such an outstanding programme that it deserves better communication to the people on the ground so that they can take part in it .
the heads of those departments who play a role in social crime prevention measures sit on that body , too .
it is up to civil society , and more specifically to communities themselves , to normalise the situation .
they managed to come up with all this , with a small budget and a very small staff .
it is about time to redirect our focus to those areas where there is a real need for these facilities .
as long as there are sports that are still not being promoted in our areas , we shall talk about transformation in this house .
if we had operated strategically and had begun to put the plan in place , things would have been different .
we make a contribution towards the overall cost to encourage people to bring the event here .
we believe that the way of the future lies with the future , not with the bitterness of the past .
i appeal to everyone in this great province to be more positive and to start thinking like a winner !
the projects , of which one will be implemented next month , will span the fields of culture , the environment , education , and energy .
we are prepared to take full responsibility , but only if we are given the full capacity and responsibility .
his team 's work is regarded as a model of good practice and i congratulate them for sustained excellent performance .
the heads and chairpersons of the control bodies , as well as the control bodies themselves , were never opposed to the transformation of these institutions .
i think that there is a very serious problem in the department in the way in which it deals with schools .
when we bear in mind and take into account what i said earlier , we must think about political opportunism .
pupils rush into the classrooms to get hold of a bench and then they claim ownership to it .
they have no personal space in the classrooms or on the playground , where the space is reduced by high fences .
fortunately , our points have now been heard and we are currently revising the criteria for the norms and standards .
i am sure we touch the hearts of all our patients and their families out there living with the infection .
on arrival there , these doctors are expected to know how to assess and manage trauma .
we could , for example , have gone into the issue of overtime and drawn up a report on what doctors earn for overtime work .
these are people who know what they are doing and have a fantastic record when it comes to this very important disease .
she raised another important point , namely that the request will be made at national level that school children can be tested .
we want to congratulate those involved and tell them to have courage , because we are with them .
i do not think it is the responsibility of welfare alone ; it should also be the responsibility of economic development .
this can only be done with one step at a time ; let us be there for them every step of the way .
the biggest obstacle in this regard is the problem of obtaining funds for the purchase of the land in an affordable way .
i believe that our constitution , which is the highest law in the land , lays the basis for answering the question .
the state must take reasonable legislative and other measures , within its available resources , to achieve the progressive realisation of this right .
i believe that there are two critical areas in which the province has failed to give hope to the poor .
those houses are empty and people are leaving , because there was no need for those houses in the first place .
they call themselves developers , and they just take the money and leave the country , and our families are left stranded without homes .
this should lead to the allocation of subsidies on the basis of need rather than that of first come , first served .
it is unacceptable that people have gone to the moon , but two or three families still have to share one toilet .
the officials will all become part of one municipality and they might well ask who the leader of the team is .
this is one of the most critical pieces of legislation , as it will lay the basis of the income of municipalities .
the fact is that the attitude and the inefficiency of officials inherited from the previous dispensation must be acknowledged .
but even after he has declared a disaster , there is no guarantee of funds because there is no disaster fund .
they referred it back to the national department of provincial and local government , and they are reworking that piece of legislation .
they are very welcome to visit the gallery , but they should please adhere to the rules of the house .
the cabinet committee that is charged with oversight of these statutory bodies is of the opinion that this review has now become urgent .
the purpose of this exercise is to ensure that the public participate in integrated development planning in their various local authority areas .
we have a unique situation in that we were never local government specialists , and i will come back to that fact .
as it is the first time that i am participating in a debate on planning , i found the document most helpful .
it is not just that the salaries deter people from coming to the provincial administration .
i know for a fact , and i have gone through this whole document , that it is one of the most difficult departments .
its representivity must be such that all of us in the western cape can feel that we have a part in that body .
he said last year in a very short paragraph of one sentence only in his speech , and i quote :
what i said was that we needed to go through the two hoops of the environment before we came to development .
i certainly think that it is unfair to suggest that my predecessor acted in an incorrect fashion .
he informed me that over the past five to six years the media had not been interested in what happened there .
we should not deprive learners of opportunities to reach their highest level and become some of the best citizens .
all citizens in this province should feel safe , secure and protected in order to build a nation on the basis of equality .
going further into the document , i discovered a very interesting array of organisations funded .
it is an organisation that deals with the training of people in the making of underwear and so on .
i wish to emphasise that the branch : works does not possess adequate funds to look after our assets .
if they continue in this way in the western cape , this cancer of unemployment and poverty will destroy the chances of recovery .
within five days we gave them a mandate , but our mandate requested that the legislation be held back .
i understand that there is only company able and licensed to manufacture these plates at present .
i believe that it is in the interests of both the province and the district councils that this process be finalised and disposed of .
once before i raised the problem of officials in the department of works needing a shift in mindset .
this tender was divided into categories and there were minimum requirements as to the number of vehicles that should be owned .
our provincial government , and other provincial governments , can play a critical role to get our nation back into job creation mode .
besides anything else , it would erode the confidence of the public in the ability of government to protect consumers .
their effectiveness is often narrowly defined in terms of the value of new investments secured and the number of jobs created .
this is due to the fact that applications where objections have been lodged take longer to process .
we will then be able to proceed with the transfer of the properties to the peninsula national park .
however , we cannot say that it is a national issue and we as a province cannot do anything .
i do not agree that these are at variance with national policy ; in fact , many of them are taken from national policy .
accordingly the agriculturists who adapt to the new technology enjoy financial benefits while agriculturists who adapt relatively slowly enjoy few benefits .
i speak on behalf of the most disadvantaged group of workers who earn the least and earn no benefits for long years of work .
there she can obtain goods , even a tot of liquor , on credit or on the book , as people say .
we believe that the way of the future lies with the future , not with the bitterness of the past .
i appeal to everyone in this great province to be more positive and to start thinking like a winner !
the projects , of which one will be implemented next month , will span the fields of culture , the environment , education , and energy .
we are prepared to take full responsibility , but only if we are given the full capacity and responsibility .
however i must state bluntly that i am determined to act and in this way establish peace and stability .
there are many residents of khayelitsha who are in fear of losing their jobs as a direct result of this unrest .
the standing committee on economic development was told only yesterday that it was unsafe to go to khayelitsha by bus .
i think we can commend him on the spirit in which he did it and we should appreciate his effort .
as a result of that , the members of scof have not been given an opportunity to apply their minds to this expenditure .
he can put the question on paper if he wants to , and i shall answer it with the greatest pleasure .
i was not absent from that cabinet meeting , nor , however , was i present because i was not here .
many of our top officials , not only in my department , but in departments throughout the administration , assisted free of charge .
the department has its unique problems and many of them are in the public eye because of the nature of these problems .
it is the content of the programme that will take us to the objectives in regard to the matters he addressed .
in fact , i think it is good when people move from province to province and city to city .
he has made a speech that says all is fine in the western cape and that we are simply the best .
we have to speak about the issue of race , and those who speak about the issue of race are not racist .
that might confirm the worst suspicions of certain members of the house , therefore , i shall not be able to do that .
while they did not reject the various subdivisions , the problem was that members seemed to get entangled in the detail .
the questions asked over the past few days have been very relevant and the provincial officials have provided outstanding answers .
she went on to say that they were going to appoint a consultant to find out how to spend the money .
i sought advice at the time and i was advised that one could get involved in a court action on the issue .
it simply was not good enough and therefore we decided not to proceed on that basis .
i do not have figures like that at my fingertips , i am afraid to say .
we shall act responsibly in the interests of our community to develop and stabilise democracy in this country .
there is a white paper which provides clear direction as to what must be done with regard to public transport in this province .
the people who did not comply with those criteria did not receive permits , because it is a national criterion .
it is also to make further provision for funds transferred to the company by the provincial government .
each shareholder committed itself to underwrite one third of the annual budget for a prescribed period .
we had a long debate and i was not afforded the opportunity to finalise that debate .
neither i nor any of the other public sector directors has ever been involved in a project of this scope .
i do not feel that there has been any omission in the fact that we did not negotiate with the national treasury .
we have the power as the province to mandate or authorise our directors , to do that .
the house must have all the facts from the officials and the department in order to apply our minds to the issue .
i cannot see why we should have crossed wires in this way and the resultant confusion .
the standing committee and the caucus were never divided about the whole matter , and that is a very clear standpoint .
in other words , they were appointed by the state president and they could be removed only by a vote of both houses .
such an institution represents the hopes and aspirations of the broader society in the present situation , not in the past .
the answer is no , the people do not have the time to go for training because they are overloaded with work .
in other words , although he effectively contributed to the murder of an innocent child , he was a free man .
they who are the government of the day are not in the house to do work for the people .
they have a complete obsession with power , because they want to use it to put their cronies into every position .
i will refer to the institution as well , because i think it is important for this to be exposed publicly .
there was no reason not to discuss it in public and eventually place it on the table .
defective law enforcement throughout the country , unemployment and poverty as well as the soft treatment of hardened criminals , contribute towards the current situation .
when people go to the polls during an election they vote inter alia for a safe society for themselves and their children .
we in the provincial government are quite prepared to talk to organised agriculture about this and develop positive strategies .
in the past i have always spoken out against unjust and brutal actions , and i did so today again , if he had wanted to listen .
it is a very difficult project to administer , and one needs people with competence to do it .
there are people in all communities in this province and in this country who have the capacity to deliver .
the rules state that a member cannot be referred to by his or her name only .
it gives the impression that the very important pillars on which a democratic government is built are on the verge of collapsing .
it is said that a government stands on the pillars of social welfare , health , education , economics , and safety and security .
the way in which bombs are being planted in the cape peninsula clearly shows that we need stronger and stricter legislation .
it should be clear from these immediate steps that we are dealing the problem in a highly coordinated and dedicated manner .
the ones who identify racism and racial discrimination become the racists , but we know that from that old apartheid relic across the way .
one just has to see the embarrassment when people watch the national minister of health performing on television .
firstly , it makes the primary victims of racism , the coloured and african communities , the major cause today of racial tension .
it does not help the cause of eradicating racism to proclaim one 's innocence by accusing others .
racism reminds me of the man who passed the cemetery and passed another man who was crying sorrowfully .
the behaviour of the employer towards his employees must be such that they will treat him with the necessary respect and dignity .
in view of the above , the bill cannot be considered until a memorandum has been submitted indicating the following :
it is equally important that the freedom of speech and expression of members is not restricted unfairly .
we have encountered this in the past , and even that members simply thanked the chairperson for his conduct of a committee .
it means that ministers are not taking responsibility for accounting for money allocated to their departments .
he said that there were hundreds of people who were upset with me because i approved the shopping centre in goodwood .
the provincial government represents the interests of women , the disabled and children , but makes no statement on them .
in fact , we have as yet not scratched the surface as far as tourism is concerned and we must aggressively embark on new strategies .
they do not take part in shaping the law for the people who in fact voted for them .
there is a distinct responsibility on our shoulders to make this alternative work and so arrest the virus .
if they look at what they have won , they will see that they did not win the western cape as such .
the first point we should make in overcoming racism is that we need to build one nation in this country .
of course , just a week after that we read about the gang fight in hanover park , in which four or five other people were killed .
the school governing body should do it and it is her job to see that they do do it .
i said , and i will continue to say , that i am the premier of all the people of our province .
i want to thank the national minister of education for the positive steps he has taken to try to cure this illness .
if he sees that certain changes are essential for the effectiveness of education , he is willing to implement them .
it is a well-known fact of political science that the quality of opposition largely determines the quality of government .
it is listed amongst those independent institutions which are meant to protect and strengthen constitutional democracy in this country .
it is said that the good governance of a country is based on or shaped by five or six pillars .
he said that we did not even bother visiting langa when the fires broke out .
when a member reads a newspaper in the house , that has always been interpreted as not truly sharing in the debate .
the point is to make it possible for disabled people to come through the front door of the provincial parliament .
i will not let my child grow up to feel that he or she is inferior to any child .
a sunday or two , or three , ago , i was at home in piketberg , and i received several calls from the community .
they have already had to keep their crews going for virtually three months , and they receive no help from the government .
we do not object to that , but there is a problem in the eastern cape with regard to the provision of health care .
i therefore rise to take part in a debate which , until yesterday afternoon , was fairly hollow and meaningless .
when farm workers say that they have heard many promises over the past five years , but little has happened , that , unfortunately , is true .
what is also inherent in this approach is providing certainty of revenue to this sector over the medium term .
let me deal with the challenges for the future as this will also determine the framework for and thrust of future budgets .
the members of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling sat for five days , two days less than initially planned .
perhaps it was to protect herself against the fact that she has no policies , no programmes and no strategies !
we should put all that aside in order to deliver to the poorest of the poor in this province .
during the year we will communicate once again with all those people in order to get further feedback .
more investment money may now flow into our banks from overseas which , in turn , may ease the pressure on borrowings .
based on the limited available expertise in this field , a decision was taken not to decentralise this important function .
however , cabinet recently approved the restructuring of the component in an effort to improve service delivery to the administration .
i therefore feel very strongly that the money is not going to be spent where it is supposed to be spent .
there are many kinds of poverty and everyone who lived under apartheid was in some way or another diminished by it .
in conclusion , i would like to thank the officials of the department for the excellent work done in the western cape .
however , the point is that one cannot move on to implementation , if one does not know what one wants to implement .
my argument is that there are some issues that require the political will , and that is what we do not have .
finally , i want to say that i take cognisance of the concern that is being expressed particularly with regard to the accessibility of our building .
then they pulled out with their tails between their legs , and they could not do the same thing again here today .
the point is that we do not allow for motions or notices of motion at any time except the beginning of proceedings .
the only exception - that is , the only legislation in which the parliamentary law adviser should be involved - is that originating in parliament itself .
we on this side of the house will , of course , participate meaningfully in order to realise those objectives as stated in the document .
it would have saved the taxpayer and the developer a lot of money and it would not have necessitated an appeal .
have the department and the ministry thought of upholding that same principle , as they do when they close schools ?
what were the costs attached and , lastly , does he not feel ashamed of or regret what he did ?
representatives from some schools have asked us to reregister students for the matriculation examination who have been chronically absent this year .
principals and invigilators have been trained so as to minimise the risk at the site where the examinations are written .
we are delivering in so many areas , and i do not even want to go into what we are delivering .
i do not know how much it is , but i will get facts for them and give them the answer . mnu m hoza : ndifuna ukuqonda apha kwinkulumbuso ukuba yintoni na umsebenzi wale nto kuthiwa yi-poverty desk ?
it is a matter of common sense that we should do so for the benefit of the people of this great city .
we hope by the end of the year to be much further than the six additional sites that have been planned .
we must not allow our rural population to remain behind while the rest of the province 's population moves forward .
i think i was away , but certainly not able to attend ; otherwise i would have attended .
in fact , we get a lot more done than what is done by the other side of the house .
he could not change it and it was a speech made in anticipation of our opposition to the budget .
if it wants to investigate a matter , the executive does not have to approach this house for permission to do so .
training in financial administration in the public sector , and in provinces in particular , could be the key to either progress or maladministration .
at least then we will know that if these social ills arise , there will be ways and means of handling the situation .
special operations , by their very intrusive , sometimes aggressive and always fleeting nature are not conducive to the gathering of latent information .
additionally , less crime will mean fewer injuries and also see eventual savings in the departments of health and of social services as well .
i would also like to thank the national secretariat for their interest and support in many of the projects that we do .
i think that the old-age home where it all happened was in worcester , but i am not sure about that .
the circumstances faced by administrators will unfortunately not change in the near future either in this country or in the rest of the world .
i , as a citizen of this country and this province , should not only see a bowls club when i go to green point .
i recommend that there should be a quota on women to make sure that we reach our objectives , too .
one way to do this is to make sure that everyone can exercise his or her democratic right to vote .
this act makes provision for the rights of the aged under the constitution and was passed to combat abuse of the elderly .
they should provide inputs and add their suggestions , and support those projects aimed at uplifting all our people .
i have referred to tourism and to the fact that we did not have as many visitors as we should have liked .
although the basic ingredients sound so simple , it is extremely difficult to achieve the combination of all three throughout an education system .
of course that is true , but it is also true that only a minority of our schools can take these things for granted .
in addition , reform must focus not only on structure , policy and regulation , but on deeper issues of the culture of the system .
there , too , the school sought foreign aid to help them to build and stock this facility .
this year the national norms and standards for the funding of schools are being introduced for the first time , in accordance with which schools are being funded in a different way .
she has always made a very constructive contribution wherever we have been , pointed out problems and presented challenges to us .
inexperienced doctors tend unnecessarily to refer to the academic hospitals cases which they should be able to manage at peripheral level .
it is therefore to be welcomed that the department is now going to be looking at new schemes to raise revenue , particularly through its hospital services .
i want to thank the chairperson and members of scof for the penetrating questions that were asked in a positive and constructive way .
in many instances a child 's word is not taken seriously , or often they are made out to be liars when they speak out .
adults may even for years try to cover up incidents of abuse to keep the good name of the institution .
that is my contribution regarding the fiscal and financial performance orientation that we would like to see this department move into .
the only controversy one can create around it is about who pays it out , and that is a perennial source of controversy .
we have to continue the active search for new methods and new mechanisms to discharge our duty towards vulnerable communities .
we received input from all the departments , as i have reported before , and we will now proceed with that piece of legislation .
there are numerous individuals , developers , contractors and so on who , with their dedication and enthusiasm , are keeping housing in the western cape on course .
when they move in , they can then use the amount that they save each month to pay their municipal account .
i am sorry , but i will have to use it during the election , because those people expect us to look after them .
in my humble opinion , informal settlements will not be the exception in future , but might become policy .
we should also not build houses because we want to meet our targets and be seen as the province that is delivering .
this might not be entirely acceptable , but it is one of the points that was made very clear to them .
important legislation on local government as envisaged in the white paper , in terms of which municipalities are to be governed , is not yet in place .
then you said that it was your right , and you were going to do it , because you had the right to do it .
we are held accountable by the people out there , and if we fail to deliver our credibility suffers .
there is no doubt in our minds that he is the right man for the right job at the right time .
he is welcome to go and see how services are being extended - not overnight , but systematically , because certain facilities have to be put in place .
i promise that we will involve those parties through other mechanisms and will take them with us in this process .
i trust that this will also become a lighter load eventually , but i do not know , as the department does not have money .
another aspect in the process of development that has always been a trial for us , is that it is riddled with red tape .
it would have been dishonest not to deal with the matter properly once i had the information on my desk .
i did that and i am proud that we are doing it , because i believe it to be the correct process .
it becomes immediately apparent that environmental affairs cannot be limited to only conservation , but must actually give priority to human rights issues .
perhaps it is being done for short-term reasons related to budgets , but we do not really know why it is being done .
we should strive towards continuous motivation , building the self-esteem of learners and teachers , and create space for creativity .
if this index declines , then throughout the world we are using too many natural resources and in this way causing too much pollution .
the money set aside is for appointing a commissioner and to set up his infrastructure for this year .
there are four issues regarding that vision of the department that i will be talking about in the time allocated to me .
earlier on , in the standing committee , we were told that there was no fragmentation , and given another answer .
the salaries of the officials in a provincial department are determined on a national basis and are not finalised by provincial governments and district councils .
the school took the initiative of asking the teachers and students to take the responsibility for repairing this .
we can now reap the fruits of the hard work that he and many other people did over a long period .
we also spoke to those people ; just made a submission , without the national minister making any promises to anyone .
if he can have certain things done by way of a political decision during some council meeting or other , then he must do so .
i concede that if he had not spoken about it it is quite possible that no one else would have discussed it .
i do want to point out to him that people who have offices in the western cape and operate heavy vehicles from here have to register here .
they cannot afford to take a week off work because then their business would be overcome and destroyed by others .
this restructuring has increased the power of purchasers to such an extent that they can play off regions in the world against each other .
the formation of the board will be done in early may , staff will be appointed by august and the centre will be operational in october .
we need to be part of a global world where all the other countries are planning aggressively and wisely to succeed .
this tells me that we in the western cape must get our house in order where this is not already the case .
as the government we can present the bureaucrats with all the applications , but we cannot do the work for them .
this is cause for concern ; it is not simply a matter of housing , it also has to do with the personal relationship between the employer and the employee .
we are sure that the officials of the department of agriculture and the people whom he serves there feel this with him .
drought and poor prices are beyond the control of agriculture and not much can be done about the situation .
the farms have been sold , but the new owner does not live in the house and the workers ' houses also stand empty .
all we have to do is ensure that those buildings are utilised in such a way that our children derive benefit from it .
it was really a privilege to be able to cooperate with them and negotiate something for agriculture with them .
one way to do this is to make sure that everyone can exercise his or her democratic right to vote .
they should provide inputs and add their suggestions , and support those projects aimed at uplifting all our people .
i have referred to tourism and to the fact that we did not have as many visitors as we should have liked .
because of the unrest that we are experiencing in the western cape at the moment , this legislation is relevant and definitely not politically motivated .
it is not perfect legislation , but it is enforceable in practice and it is important for the house to pass it .
the moment it comes to the rights of other people , whom we do not like , we immediately oppose them .
my door stands open , and i invite other people to come and discuss with me what they think really ought to be done .
i say this because the government of the western cape is not investing enough in the safety of the children in the western cape .
brighter street lights , floodlights , the closure of unnecessary dark alleys are the things that are needed to keep our children safe .
we will seek intervention , so that we can see whether this process is not in fact an abuse of taxpayers ' money .
we cannot discuss matters in the opening address of the premier unless they are directly related to the topic under discussion .
the administration then went to the treasury to ask for agreement to this unauthorised expenditure and treasury would not agree .
many businessmen , and probably matriculants as well , were entitled to ask : what became of service delivery in the province ?
i appeal to the house to uphold that point of order in this session and bear it in mind .
this is a prelude to what their argument will be in regard to matters which the province is dealing with .
it was requested in the meeting of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling yesterday and scof voted against it .
if it had been a normal dispensation where there had been no change of cabinet and portfolios , it would have been different .
in the absence of having received the detail , has he made an informed decision to support the bill in front of him ?
i would like to inform her that i personally saw teachers there , and i know of teachers who received money for this .
there are many other officials who can work over the weekends or at other times to register voters , but teachers may not .
and if it comes out in the answer that will be provided that the money was not properly spent , what will he say ?
this statement could easily be interpreted by those brutal murderers that they now have a ministerial licence to kill farmers .
if a leader is unable to maintain the balance between expectations and reality , then he could come to grief as a leader .
in fact , i am not going to waste my time on them because i am coming to that point right now .
in my speech i was going to thank some of the people on the other side who are actually assisting in making democracy work .
while the vast majority of educators are prepared to put the interests of their learners first , there are always the exceptions .
in the rural areas this need for growth , development and the creation of job opportunity is reaching critical status .
this is not democracy ; this is certainly not the manner in which the people of this province should be treated .
need ever feel that this government is anything other than a helping hand in their journey through life .
what we are talking about is actually double that amount because the intention is to spend the balance in the next financial year .
this is just a report before the house , and it does not affect the validity of our decision on the second reading .
the fact of the matter is that we are giving effect to an instruction , and to do so i asked for the money from the central government .
i agree that i have also been frustrated by the time it is taking to appoint a commissioner .
despite the weather , commuters have been forced to walk long distances if they have wanted to use their clipcards on the buses .
by its very nature , if transport is in crisis , that crisis affects thousands of other people who are dependent on transport .
they benefit from a situation in which commuters have no choice , because sometimes commuters take the transport that is immediately available .
to begin with i wish to convey my sincere thanks to the standing committee on economic development for the work they have done .
the motivation for this project was to create job opportunities , which , with the high percentage of unemployment at present , are much needed in the country .
unfortunately it is now a matter of their wiping away their tears and accepting that this will be the situation .
we cannot simply tell people not to worry and that everything will be financed out of tax .
the more attacks occur on farms , the more people will leave the rural environment and the more people will leave our fatherland .
if we have to talk about morality , then i would rather stop him , because he should be the last person to talk about it .
in the first place , there were accusations made that i was involved in trying to delay the motion that is before the house today .
during the past two years i have only on one occasion before asked my wife to be present in the gallery .
perhaps both parties can come out if this in a very dignified way if they would only try to come to the conference table .
as far as upholding the law is concerned , i believe that one must operate from basic principles which apply in all situations .
by sticking to these fundamental principles , the three that i have mentioned , we leave terrorists and criminals little room to manoeuvre .
indeed , it is a test of the ability of these public representatives who have been elected by the entire community of the western cape .
today 's debate really showed me that in these very difficult times we do indeed have that common political will .
the country 's constitution says that i have freedom of association , which could include the freedom not to want to associate .
if it was a right for blacks to serve in the cabinet we could ask for court intervention .
ek stuur solank vir jou ' n voorbeeld van die pamflette wat jy solank tussen die boere kan versprei om hulle te verdeel .
the reality is that the constitution obliges us , and they should read the constitution , to redress the legacy of apartheid .
but now he will concede that one does not only get black cows , brown cows and white cows .
i must admit i cannot give a ruling on that because i do not know what the term means .
what we are noting is the attempted murder of the sixteen-year-old child and the ongoing beatings and evictions of farm workers .
this amount will be reserved to reduce outstanding debts and may not be used to increase other expenditure .
there is no doubt that we are extremely proud of the developments that have taken place in this part of the world .
all of us should visit those people as a group to look at the conditions under which they live and to talk to them .
they then explained to me that they had been sent out of their classrooms because their parents had not paid their school fees .
this is a first for this government and we hope that it will pave the way for similar initiatives in the future .
they are as follows , and not necessarily in their order of importance : finance , economic affairs , social services , education and safety and security .
regarding our financial controls , i am of the opinion that the control over the finances of the province is good and satisfactory .
they seem to think that as long as they stand on a moral platform , it is all right to make racist statements .
when the people vote for us , they accuse the voters of being racist , insulting them and insulting their intelligence .
we welcome these children and we try to do our best for them , although at present there is significant room for improvement .
i said that if the police were in the area and someone was breaking the law , they would arrest him .
let us be honest and admit that mistakes are made across all boundaries , and address those mistakes with honesty .
an important equation should be seen in the seriousness of the problems and the need to apply drastic solutions .
i am concerned about what has happened to farm workers over the past five years , because very little has happened for them .
after all , he himself has suffered at its hands in the recent past , and had to be protected by security guards of this government .
they should put aside petty politics and join those of us who have a bright vision for the future of the western cape .
god plays the most important role in my life , therefore i believe in the future of our province , our country and our continent .
i also wish to thank the loyal staff of the branch : corporate services for their dedication and hard work over the last financial year .
with all respect to all the departments and their efforts so far , for which i thank them , we have to focus on this enormous problem .
it was a humble beginning by people and a government who never had an opportunity before to implement it .
it was never the idea to involve the parliamentary law adviser routinely in legislation before standing committees .
in addition , i think it would be appropriate for the executive to make more use of the house when making important statements .
if it becomes clear that the small parties in the house cannot get by with the money , we will look at it again .
the time allowed for comment lapses next week , and we hope to submit the bill to the cabinet soon after that so that it can be published for comment .
in looking at the companies that were awarded the contract , one saw that the likelihood of being able to obtain compensation was extremely limited .
it is the chairperson of the standing committee who must run and conduct the affairs of the standing committee as he sees fit .
if she had listened , she would have heard me say that these posts are being created precisely in order to achieve better service delivery .
when one follows the situation closely from day to day , one notes that promises have been made from the national level .
i would sincerely request him to comply with this , although i certainly will not rule that he is out of order .
i would once again say that the questioner should place any relevant information before me and then i can deal with the matter .
we are finding that black businesses are leaving the province , because it is clear that in the rest of the country black business is thriving .
we do have problems in various clinics regarding pharmacies , but i do see some progress in future .
i also wish to thank every public servant who has worked hard over the past year , serving the people of our province .
much has been said in certain quarters about how some of our people feel excluded in the province on the grounds of their race .
we cannot allow visitors from this country and other parts of the world to be subjected to these unacceptable conditions .
on a serious note , however , i subscribe to much of what he said and i understand that he said it from the heart .
it is our police force that is seriously disadvantaged in their fight to curb the tens of thousands of serious crimes in the province .
we cannot , of course , pronounce upon private homes , but we can certainly look at homes that are within the provincial sector .
in conclusion , it is imperative that the role of sport and recreation in the development of humans be acknowledged and recognised .
we are hoping for a quick resolution at the national level as to where or under whom school sport should fall , under education or under sport .
this is commendable and we should keep up the good work with the limited resources that sport and recreation has at its disposal .
what he is really saying is that if a black player is included in the team , the white players can still look after him .
after all , as i have just stated , he was an outstanding player and an outstanding coach with a good record .
it is within this context that i appeal to everyone in the house to think carefully before making statements .
as a compromise , this section of the bill was omitted and it was decided that it should be tabled separately .
we do not support corporal punishment , but we will have to do far more to help our dedicated principals in this extremely difficult task .
this was made possible by the involvement of the local rotary club , who facilitated overseas money to finance the laboratory .
at the end of the day it is going to cost the department far more to get those schools up to standard again .
i further want to argue that as long as there is still a lack of transformation in various areas in the province , we will never keep quiet .
certainly , all i can hope to do is to take a few short steps along this very long road .
to eliminate any form of discrimination , we must act against staff who are guilty of behaviour of this kind .
i will send him my speech so that he can be more knowledgeable about health and what we are doing in that department .
i do not think that much has been said about this in the past , but as soon as we have a disaster , it comes up immediately .
i think i have made it clear that we need considerably more funds to implement all the projects on our books .
therefore no one in the province can answer the very simple question : which parcels of land has this province identified for release for housing ?
in spite of the fact that the city of cape town had objections during their submission to the cabinet , we approved it unanimously .
he wanted to know if it would not be much better to stretch the rand further and give people serviced sites .
i therefore think we all have a responsibility to display the political will to prevent that , so that this money can be collected .
that was , in the end , the easiest way of achieving consensus , rather than getting representatives of the councils there .
local government has been shaped in such a manner that it has become the form of government that is closest to the people .
it is not only the work that they have done , but what will be done in the coming year that is important .
what i did highlight was that there were problems at certain municipalities , and that we should stand together as a province and as a house .
if we heard today that we could give those municipalities several billion rands and support them very strongly , that would be quite right .
there is no doubt about it that in the interests of good governance we need to see to it that we take ourselves under review .
the cabinet resolved that matters that are considered controversial should be taken to cabinet by the minister concerned with planning .
in particular , as a provincial government , we shall have to implement overarching operational policies , so as to achieve consistency in the western cape .
the commissioner will to a large extent act as an ombudsman for the environment and as a protector of last resort of the environment .
again , i would like to drift from my speech to reveal to the house some startling figures with regard to this unit .
in the documentation on libraries i found it interesting that there is a library in every prison , and in some prisons there are two .
as history has proven over and over again , however , not all progress is good progress and not all change is good change .
the more strongly one feels and the clearer the direction , the easier is the association and the more certain the ultimate decision .
one challenge we have not seen this department meeting is implementing a policy of transformation .
in the western cape we are told not to worry because unemployment here is less than the national average .
one cannot make laws for a country without the money or infrastructure to implement them .
we have a programme whereby we train them in how to tender , so that they will not default in future contracts .
the increase that we announced is really no more than one tank of fuel for a medium-sized car once a year .
think of the expense incurred to get the helicopters , fire-fighters and so on there to combat an unnecessary fire .
if there is legislation we shall have to implement it and if there is no legislation , we shall have to see what we can do .
i think that is sad , coming , as i do , from the corporate world , where a person is always trained regarding the latest trends .
i also wish to appeal to him to ensure that the budget makes provision for more inspectors so that the lives of the farm people can improve .
the rubbish that comes from beyond our borders is lying everywhere on the pavements and our factories that used to make quality clothes have closed their doors .
as important as they are to her , farm workers are important to me as well and they are very close to my heart .
we have the greatest access to these tools right here in our province , yet why do we not celebrate these achievements more often ?
it is within this context that i appeal to everyone in the house to think carefully before making statements .
let us , all of us on both sides of this house , form a team and work together in the best interest of all our people .
it is a shame that we are only meeting today to put legislation in place which should have been there a long time ago .
the act stipulates that one has the right to object and here we are asking that that should not happen .
i felt a little uneasy , but after i thought it over , i felt that the standing committee and i should be reasonable .
job creation is not the sole responsibility of a provincial government or a national government , nor of the business sector alone .
it seems to me that the voice of the church has also become silent , but the church has also played its part in it .
the answer is a blunt no , it is not possible for any one person in this country to contain crime .
the other provinces did not pay their volunteers for the service rendered to the community in the interests of democracy .
we have been called on to authorise that expenditure and the standing committee decided not to take evidence .
the feeling was that teachers could not simply leave classrooms and go and register voters because that would be detrimental to the matriculants .
if my party , the governing party , makes an appeal , then i shall not make such statements as i am sure were made .
the matter came before cabinet , as we had noted that only the top level of officials were volunteering .
one only realises savings after a particular date , and one would understand that to be the end of a financial year .
those savings are paid into a pool which can be offered to the provincial treasury because we have not used the money .
this provincial government delivers and people from other provinces flock to the western cape to use our hospitals and our schools .
exactly for the same number that the national minister of finance paid to be nominated the best minister of finance .
hopefully he will display the same amount of gusto in attacking their non-performance as we see when he attacks this government .
when we look at other provinces , we see that no other province delivers like this province with regard to concrete projects .
there is no one in our province whose aspirations i will not do everything in my power to advance .
there are many things that we in the city take for granted , but which , to the people in the rural areas , are luxuries .
once again i realised what a great and divine honour it is for us to serve our people in this house .
we note with interest that the province has in the past undermined and neglected this principle which is considered important .
i believe that tells us in our hearts that that cannot be the christian way of doing things .
i think that we as a house should be saying that we should put our money where our mouth is on this question .
and further strongly condemns such forms of corruption and requests that a report on the matter be presented to the standing committee .
there should be negotiations and resolutions on all kinds of problems that face the public transport system in the province and nationally .
what i have a serious problem with is that from the national level he has been instructed to operate in a certain way .
the tragedy of it is that the more they say there is no problem , the more people are murdered and raped .
i say this , even though it was in a period when it was relatively safe and on a route that was relatively safe .
in essence , his answer was that if we as a province did not have the power to issue guarantees , so what ?
when i look for people 's expertise i do not look at their colour ; i look at the contribution which they can make .
at the end of the day judges should give judgment within the framework of facts and evidence before the court .
his judgment was based on the fact that the man would not be able to serve a long sentence , only a certain number of years .
the reality of the matter is that that judgment brings me to the conclusion that the judge is the victim of that society .
with regard to the issue of a more unified opposition , cooperation instead of undermining each other is a high priority for everybody .
it is a very important situation and it will test the fine words that we may say in commitment here today .
they lived on the fat of apartheid and made no contribution to the broader running of a greater urban area .
another important aspect related to this is the fact that in terms of this regulation we do not need to do an inspection .
i want to ask him what happened in worcester while he was mayor and a contract was entered into for a computer system there ?
i wish to state very clearly , therefore , that we need a broad plan and vision to address violence on farms .
it tightens the law in enabling the cases of illegal gambling to be exposed and therefore successfully prosecuted .
just because the man says it is his baby does not mean that he can bring up the baby in the wrong way .
surely , when he says this we think that they are going to arrest them very soon , but a few days later we hear the same utterances .
are we all fully prepared to tackle the evil of terror and deal with it ?
sir , it will take some time before we as public officials can reassure the public that the threat is under control .
firstly , we must be seen to be doing all in our power to ensure the safety of our people .
we must accept them as our leaders , and i do , but they refuse to accept coloureds as the leaders of blacks .
i have been the one who has said in recent times in this house that we must do something positive for farm workers .
he made a general quotation and in the next sentence he went further and he spoke of frivolous behaviour in yesterday 's debate .
we will have to put our feet in the water and meet one another in the middle ; then reconciliation will come .
this can and must be done , but it can only be done if there is a clampdown on corruption throughout the country .
he now , at last , admits what we have been saying for a long time , which is that he and his government do not want to accept responsibility .
it is according to these pillars that a government is tested , and it must continuously be scrutinised on the basis of these pillars .
he led the mayors of places such as knysna and george out of that meeting , to great applause .
more specifically , i would like to thank him for his unconditional support of the national minister in his spoken effort to combat crime .
we are saying that they should move to the towns and squat there ; then they will have a chance of getting a house .
if we are doing so badly , let us once again draw up a balance sheet for the nine provinces and judge which province comes out on top .
the national minister of finance has himself recognised the problem in last year 's budget speech , when he said , and i quote :
i am pleased to report that it has not been necessary to impose this degree of pressure this year .
when she finished her speech , she tried to indicate to the committee that we should ask her no further questions .
we have no policy in place , and neither have any benchmarks been put before us about what that policy is .
perhaps one day , when racial discrimination is truly eliminated , we will be able to celebrate the day rather than commemorate it .
it is therefore necessary for us here to outline how we would see the public service functioning in the western cape .
this should be regarded as a challenge , and we are looking forward to attending the awarding of the honours shortly .
it would be a small gesture to show disabled people that we are going a little way to accommodate them .
after giving them the rationale behind the appointment , they understood and even gave us a letter confirming that .
and his entire staff for the support services which they have rendered during the past year and also the excellent annual report released yesterday .
if funds are not made available to the chairpersons they , in turn , are not able to deliver effective service to the committees .
in preparing the budget for the standing committee , i consulted with various ministers during the course of the year .
it seems to me that if something happens in the western cape that does not suit him , it very quickly becomes problematical .
as provincial government we are unable to count the number of people involved in fighting the fires across all the sectors .
would it suit him well if the printed media were to convey this kind of impression without necessarily rectifying or disputing it ?
the national minister of safety and security boldly claimed that the situation would be brought under control by last friday .
we turn around and say it is good enough for them to be on the trains ; why not on the buses ?
we will go out of our way to help africa , but the democracy that we talk about should also start taking place in africa .
drivers leaving their homes in the morning were not sure whether they would return to their loved ones that night .
so , it would seem that everybody who wanted to get to work on that day could indeed , with some inconvenience , do so .
currently , we are trying to push the national department of public works to move a bit faster than they are doing to establish those stations .
the interim contract will be replaced by contracts based on the model agreement , as drawn up by the national department of transport .
where it was not possible to see a patient , that person was obviously asked to return the following day .
now they come along and nit-pick , instead of taking pride in the province and saying that it is doing well .
teachers , doctors and nurses are but a few categories of dedicated public servants without whom there can be no delivery to the people .
there is no one in our province whose aspirations i will not do everything in my power to advance .
a special word of thanks to the leader of the house and minister of housing , who is now also responsible for corporate services .
the provision of housing will never come to an end ; we know that it is something that will always be with us .
some good points were made , even by the members on that side of the house ; it is a pity they were few and far between .
it is his very first wedding indeed , and i think the reason for his absence should be genuinely appreciated in the house .
i am happy to report that we at last have somebody to chair the panel .
the conflict between poverty and democracy is becoming our greatest dilemma and even more so under the conditions of rising unemployment .
can an infant democracy heal the searing wounds of past injustices and bind up all the diverse people of the western cape ?
they know where they are going with finance in their department and also , in a broader sense , with the finances of the province of the western cape .
it hovered for two or three hours as i tried to find things which we could put on the agenda .
i still need to satisfy myself absolutely that that is what he did , but i thought i should point it out to him .
he then convenes his cabinet and informs them about what is required and instructs them to make it happen .
few know how hard they work but the fact that so many of our projects are taken up for countrywide implementation is acknowledgement enough .
there are members in this service who think that they can get away with anything , precisely because the accused is minister .
in all honesty , however , i must say that for the police it is really attempting the impossible to look after all the schools .
my directorate is actively involved in attempting to resolve a variety of problems to identify the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders clearly .
they also have my assurance that sport and recreation will do all in its power to help them in achieving this goal .
if we have this kind of situation , i do not think we can stop talking about racism in this house .
in view of the small amount of money allocated to the department , one therefore has to give the department credit for what they are doing .
the house has our assurance that we shall put shoulder to the wheel to ensure that they are fully executed .
we have once again outperformed all the other provinces in most fields , including the all-important field of education .
this is indeed good news for our new matriculants who have the dedication , ambition and drive to enter these markets .
even in a single school it takes good management to get the combination of circumstances right for effective teaching and learning to take place .
this is an ongoing process as growing numbers of our schools will face the substantial but healthy challenge in our society .
according to experts in this sphere the families and communities are in most instances the cause of the problems experienced by our young people .
i also feel that she must now commit herself to visiting this particular school to try to change the conditions there .
these are but a few of the challenges that have contributed towards generating a degree of uncertainty in the minds of the public .
the teachers have brilliant ideas as to the utilisation of those classrooms , but a lack of financial resources prevents them from realising these objectives .
it is doubly sad for me to hear about these problems , as i trusted and respected the national minister of health .
again i would like to know if the department has been contacted about this and what our province 's strategy will be , if any .
i see that he is not present at the moment , but i do thank him in his absence for the role he played there .
even though , to a certain extent , i must agree with them , in certain instances the family is largely where the problem starts .
we must begin looking for a more flexible policy that can be adapted to the circumstances and needs of the different communities .
that would , in my opinion , be a better solution than complaining that we have too little money and cannot build houses .
not only are they living in houses that they built themselves , but they have the skills to compete in the job market .
at present there is much appreciation for the way in which the department of development planning is giving a lead and providing support to local authorities in the rural areas .
of course , the ordinary people in macassar are suffering from the smell , the flies and the sores which have appeared on their bodies as a result of this .
at a town like darling there are two libraries , in a town like uniondale there are three libraries , and how many other communities are without any libraries at all ?
so we find that they are funded and we are not sure what the activity really is and what this organisation actually does .
i do not think that the province can really afford to take over harbours that are in the state of disrepair that they are .
transport in this province should as much as possible be governed by provincial laws , tailored to suit our specific needs .
in the second place , the branch : works is responsible for the maintenance of existing facilities , the cleaning of buildings and the maintenance of gardens .
we have not yet received an answer as to where we have to find the money to administer the act on behalf of the national government .
in my speech , however , i shall focus these objectives more specifically on the realities experienced by the people in my constituency and along the west coast .
this view is based on the thorough analysis of the dynamics of the global world economy and how that dynamic influences us in the western cape .
we shall increasingly have to examine these options as vehicles whereby we can provide our essential infrastructure and ensure that provincial properties are maintained .
this initiative must be seen in conjunction with the products of origin legislation that is originating from the branch : agriculture of this department .
a draft is on the table , and we will approach the standing committee on economic affairs once cabinet has given its approval .
in accordance with a cabinet decision earlier this year , the chief directorate will be transformed into a statutory organisation under management of the provincial minister of agriculture .
i know of one farm where the people go to a factory to make rosettes when they have finished their work in the vineyards .
i want to tell her that when i travel in the peninsula , i see many squatters ; people who live in less than one room .
we have once again outperformed all the other provinces in most fields , including the all-important field of education .
perhaps these issues should be publicly debated because they affect the future of the constitution and the freedom of all citizens .
i would also like to mention that it is not the first time that legislation has been brought to the house as an urgent measure .
if he needs so much security just for one minute , what about those that are exposed to trauma and a violent situation every day ?
therefore , the government should be fully responsible and give a commitment to solving the problems in public transport in this province .
it does not augur well for orderliness , for people to put the lives of other people in danger , and it is not acceptable .
i will talk to them and explain to them the actions that we will take if it becomes necessary to take that action .
instead they are being allocated to police stations in the safe and wealthy suburbs where children are protected by private security guards and high-rise fences .
instead of combating crime on the flats , the police are compelled to protect the so-called constitutional rights of those people .
if that is not plain and clear , i do not know what it is plain and clear for the other side of the house .
the point i am making is that if they had put a little more energy and work into this we would have had more volunteers .
we have tried to shortcut this issue by not going through that process so that we can take a decision .
he must also remember that he has indicated that he can do with all the money that he can get as a department .
it could be that in other departments they used a different ratio to pay people , but i know the question concerns my department .
it has to be done in close partnership with the local authorities , who must take the key and in many ways play a leading role .
the problem why many of those strategies did not work in the past is that they have sought to deal with everything at once .
we therefore will have to take the full force of the laws at our disposal and deal with crime as an integrated and an organised structure .
for the poor , the disabled and the elderly one day may mean a lifetime if they have to wait one day longer for a pension .
he cannot stand here and make a statement claiming leadership and think that that equals hard work .
this means for the vast majority of the inhabitants in small towns and in small communities that there is no hope of fixed employment .
we prefer not to be bound by any restrictions that may be imposed on the other provinces when the testing period has been concluded .
only last week the naked reality of the racist practices and exploitation on farms and in rural areas hit us hard once again .
there he asked that transport should not be politicised , since transport was introduced in order to serve the community , whatever their political standpoints .
however , that is a separate issue to the way that we as legislators handle legislation in the house , and in parliament as a whole .
we did not have enough time to apply our minds and we did not have all the information at our disposal .
the national and provincial governments must make laws dealing with the types of municipalities , the demarcation of municipal areas , the municipal electoral system , and functions of councils .
i accept what he says , but that will not prevent me from examining the record and possibly issuing a ruling .
we felt that the politics that were being played out were not the politics that we wanted to become involved in at the moment .
the fact that it is going to be a national act and that there is not a provincial act in that regard is not the biggest crisis on earth .
why has a municipality which had a big surplus and where things were going well , collapsed almost entirely within five years ?
in several instances victims were killed in circumstances where the assailants had accomplished their purpose and it was totally unnecessary to kill .
they are in striking contrast to his deathly silence and silent presence when reports are received of a farm worker who has been assaulted or beaten to death .
stability on our farms and in our rural areas is essential for agriculturalists to be able to produce and for agricultural development .
the proposed amendments in the bill will go a long way to assist in the closure of illegal operators who contest the validity of the law .
sir , you will remember that in the last session the same thing happened in that the ruling party did not participate in the debate .
there are a few things that i can do to get the report , but i will go about it the right way .
they also do not understand that when we on this side of the house want to cooperate with them , they do not have the foggiest idea .
we all have the vote , the right to freedom of religion and the right to state our point of view freely on any subject .
be strong and of good courage ; do not be afraid , nor be dismayed , for the lord your god is with you wherever you go .
the time has come for us to do everything possible to afford protection to those who placed us here and to ourselves .
one cannot allow the application of the law to be disrupted and the officials applying the law to be intimidated .
while our government is committed to tough action against all manner of criminals in this province , there are some ground rules that need to be followed .
how much more productive would the farms not be if we were all regarded as people and were prepared to cooperate with them ?
organised agriculture in the western cape and in the country stands on its own legs and does not allow itself to be prescribed to by a political party .
we have certainly in the past permitted members to speak about how a bill has been dealt with and how the evidence has been dealt with .
it was an attempt to frustrate the process against the wishes of the people and at the cost of the people .
i do not speak only for this province , because the other ministers of finance in the other provinces think along the same lines as i do .
it is the poor who are hopeless , have no education and no access to jobs that this government must look after .
these initiatives can undoubtedly become a reality if we work together to achieve the ideals and aspirations of the people of the western cape .
they now find themselves in a situation in which some of their colleagues sit on the other side of this house and earn a reasonable salary .
i refuse to accept that their coalition government is in the interests of the poor and the working class of the province ; it is not .
how could they have asked him to market the government if the government did what they purport to have done .
do they see the potential which exists and can they imagine the real unity that could actually be built , if we worked together ?
we are afraid because we did not know about the existence of vlakplaas until a few years ago , and that people had been killed .
i would like to state for the record that i have never been to constantia when anyone has been shot , raped , beaten to death or anything of that nature .
at the same time , we cannot bring about development and redistribution on a sustained basis unless we put our economy on the road of sustained growth .
when things go well on the farms , they also go well for the farm workers , and they also go well for the rural area involved .
but when the agriculturists struggle , the farm workers also , of necessity , struggle , and then that entire rural area struggles .
for as long as i occupy this ministry , i will continue to present a budget with the ultimate goal of the eradication of joblessness .
i can remember that it took one a long time to understand the white book , as it was first known .
we are also tremendously concerned about the aspect of the commissioner for children , which is provided for in the constitution of the western cape .
it is true that we cannot wait any longer for national government to give clarification and come up with a recommendation .
progress in the matter will , of course , depend on the amount of time which politicians have available in this election year to drive the process .
last year was an election year , and that interfered with our activities , so that we sat less , in total , than we had the previous year .
you must do as we tell you , because you come and go as politicians , and we , as officials , remain there into infinity .
this is as a result of the movement of funds from new posts to secretarial allowances for backup and support for the chairpersons of committees .
a beautiful plan was drawn up to market the provincial parliament in the right way so that we could fulfil the task of public participation .
we realise that this means that the knowledge of members is increased and that note is taken of the inputs made .
it is an attempt to politicise civil servants in this province , both provincial civil servants and civil servants who are employed by the national government .
after release this department or any - and this is important - private welfare organisation can be involved in providing the services required and supporting the offender .
if he was referring specifically to what i said , i certainly do not believe i said what he has just said .
in any event , we do not have rules in that regard nor do i think it would be easy to make specific rules about that .
his point that nothing prevented the standing committee from dealing with this is , with all due respect , not acceptable either .
he died because he did not get food for the last few months and was kept like a dog in a kennel .
different chapters of the act may commence on different dates , but the target date for its initial implementation is january next year .
it was very swiftly contained , but i do believe it is my responsibility to report it to the house .
we prefer not to be bound by any restrictions that may be imposed on the other provinces when the testing period has been concluded .
we must create opportunities for farm workers and their children in particular , and we must ensure at all times that our farms remain productive and profitable .
i have addressed the issues of aids , unemployment , poverty , racism and local government cooperation and have called for positive inputs from our opposition .
well , they cannot be proud of their party 's track record anywhere else in this country , so what are they proud of ?
it will take two years to complete the entire construction , and the sooner we get to that approval , the better things will go there .
irrespective of which side of the line one stands , all of us are unhappy with the present situation .
i will leave no stone unturned to see that we make every effort to reach the goals that we should reach .
countries do not embark on war lightly , because in order to win they require total commitment by both the state and its economy , as well as the people .
i am not sure whether it is simply that we are not hearing much about it , but it seems to have a very low profile .
however , what this department fails to discern is the issue of transformation of the department itself and the provincial police service .
last week we heard and saw in the media the desperate situation at some of the police stations in the previously disadvantaged areas .
we are working closely with the national and other provincial departments on this matter in order to find a uniform solution to a very vexing problem .
be that as it may , they were contributions and in general i got the impression that the department is supported in its activities .
it only takes an hour or two a day to do it , and there are many people who are prepared to do it .
there can be no doubt that if we are to combat crime effectively , the social and moral fabric of our society needs strengthening .
however , we should remember that cool heads need to prevail once we have made any decision which has been the outcome of a democratic process .
there seems to be a degree of apprehension about , of perhaps a lack of understanding of , this system among educators in my area .
when i speak about transformation , then i should like to place it within the context of what is humanly feasible within the limits of the budget we are currently discussing .
it is significant to know that this has not been happening in the western cape , but the newspapers seem to differ .
garbage in , garbage out , but we do agree that the criteria needs revision and we are in the process of doing that very substantially .
we must appeal to the factories and the companies that have a large staff to ensure that they are inoculated this year .
i want to get to poverty and specifically refer to the research we have done with regard to the poverty-stricken areas .
all one ever thinks of when thinking of civil servants is people with grey suits , grey hair and grey manners towards one .
wherever they have gone , they have been able to traverse difficult paths and show that people of colour have the abilities , if given the chance .
i was disconcerted to learn that the building industry dubbed last year as the worst financial year they had encountered since the world war ii .
we should not penalise people who accept the responsibility for providing for their own families and who show initiative in this regard .
is it that he does not have to stay in one of those houses himself , and has no interest at all in who has to stay there ?
firstly , flats erected by the local authorities using loans , as on the cape flats , are the property of those respective local authorities . to fight with me and say that those people should be given life rights does not help .
i must place on record today that we are concerned because it seems as if some steam has been lost on the part of the national government .
the legitimacy of the election results should be beyond questioning and we on this side of the house support all efforts in this regard .
i wish to address a request to my colleagues . when we walk this road , let us try to keep politics out of it .
the driver of the bulldozer , when approaching the house to demolish it , refused to run over a perfectly good home .
i have complete sympathy and empathy for those dilemmas , but i do not believe that that means that we should not tackle the challenge head on .
it is not just about the material aspects of that problem , but it does have something to do with the workplace environment .
i almost had a sleepless night last night , trying to think of what he was going to do and on what points he was going to attack me .
however , they do not know that the people that are really responsible for this exercise are at works and do not receive the necessary credit for it .
when we deal with the allocation of accommodation , parking and other forms of restructuring , every section will be consulted , be it for parking or accommodation .
sometimes , however , it may only appear that they are the same and it is , of course , impossible in certain circumstances for the chair to judge immediately .
the creation of prosperity and improvement in the standard of living of people is important for us to order to ensure stability and peace in the western cape .
our satisfaction derives not merely from the fact that the policy and strategies in essence correspond with the white paper drawn up by the national department .
labourers elect to stay on the farms , but owing to legislation and intervention from above , the harmony between the employee and the employer has been disturbed .
look at the poor condition of the gravel roads , and we are constantly hearing the excuse that there is no money to fix the roads .
there can be no doubt that if we are to combat crime effectively , the social and moral fabric of our society needs strengthening .
however , we should remember that cool heads need to prevail once we have made any decision which has been the outcome of a democratic process .
it took the standing committee a long time to analyse where we should insert this amendment in the road transportation act .
it also provides that the minister shall publish this in the government gazette and in a newspaper which circulates in the declared area .
these are the people who are being forced to walk the distance to the buses waiting on the outskirts of town .
the province must answer that question , because they stand accused today of not dealing with the situation at an early enough stage .
he also grabbed me by the throat a few times , and i accept what he said in the spirit in which he said it .
unless this government deals more harshly with criminals , the community will be forced to organise and protect themselves , their homes and their own neighbourhoods .
the danger exists , and i think that the debate has proved it this afternoon , that one tries to shift the responsibility for what is happening in the communities .
attending a committee meeting this morning where members were informed does not prohibit the moving of a motion in the house this afternoon .
at the time that expenditure was incurred our treasury proceeded from the standpoint that the province was not responsible for that expenditure .
we have an unauthorised expenditure , an emotional statement that this was a call by the national government , and no facts on the financial implications .
is it perhaps because the volunteers at the lower levels of the public service do not actually have pride in the cabinet and the provincial government ?
you will also be pleased to know , i hope , that i rely on information given to me by officials .
i want to ask him what was decided on in the cabinet regarding the average payment per person that volunteered ?
we should look at whether we have an effective government that can not only pay out pensions , but also run an election smoothly .
i do not have the information at my disposal , and i cannot be expected to retain all that information in my head .
i am following your ruling which you gave earlier on that if one is unable to answer questions , one must say so .
if accuracy is required , i will take the time to investigate it myself and reply to the questions in an accurate form .
if i am assured that education did not lose out , that is applying my mind and that is taking my responsibility .
they look to us to break the silence and to fulfil society 's promise to them that they should be nurtured .
if he does not manage it , then we must know why he has been unable to manage it and we must know what we are going to do about it .
today her leader in the province can tell us that he took a bus to khayelitsha to project a certain image .
otherwise , if i only deal with the one figure , i will be told that i misled them and therefore i want to correct the matter immediately .
it must be placed on the agenda immediately so that the cake can be cut in an appropriate way in providing a public transport system .
is she saying that those people are not citizens of the country and they are not allowed to enjoy their constitutional rights ?
we were authorising a shareholding , but we did not need to look at the details of the shareholding !
they entered into discussions with the standing committee and they have no problem whatsoever with the financial arrangements and with the tenor of this bill .
if we do not reach agreement , i will suspend business of the house for five minutes in order to obtain agreement on this issue .
the first is addressed to my colleagues on this side of the house , because i believe that some of them understand the context .
black businesses become desperate and they are forced into joint ventures with white companies , purely to be able to get access to funds .
they do not always have the friends , and that is why they were discriminated against in the past , and there is still discrimination against them today .
our business people should not trust this propaganda , because it is aimed at misleading our people into believing this nonsensical propaganda .
it must not only be an act that is good for all people ; it must be an act which can really be implemented consistently .
let me say that he , the newly appointed traffic manager , was appointed above professional , qualified traffic officers who applied for the position .
the chair suspects that he will have to make the same ruling later in this debate , so at least i have now tried to be even-handed .
he says that he has declared his interests , and he keeps this obfuscation going about having declared his interests .
does he not think that it is time to sit down together and for them stop chasing one another ?
do we merely point our fingers , level some criticism , make a political noise here and there , or will we tackle the evil head-on ?
sir , the young democracy , scarcely of school-going age and not yet seven years old , is today in the dock facing these charges .
the time has come for us to make a collective effort to really make a difference and to put a stop to the terror and destruction .
on the one hand they say that we should build a nation , but on the other hand they say that we should divide the people .
i want to ask him whether this farmer has a political claim against leaders who caused him to spend the night in jail , although innocent .
what i am arguing is that this should be put to the vote here so that we can get the feeling of the house on the motion .
this has been most disturbing to me , because i believe that central government requires to come up with the money when there is a disaster such as this .
they have a duty to attempt to represent the interests of the decreasing number of people in this province that voted for them .
their conduct reveals a party in the process of losing power and sinking into a pool of uncertainty .
continually that side of the house in effect tries to pit this province as outside the rest of the nation that we are building .
like most other sensible and learned people in the world , i am of the firm belief that there is a direct link between poverty and crime .
it will not happen as long as we stand on one bank of the river throwing stones at the people on the other bank .
on one hand we worked with the department of home affairs when we looked at the issuing of identity documents to the voters .
i know that i will receive their full support , because if we want to achieve even greater success in service delivery , it will require an even greater team effort .
during the interview , the principal agreed that despite the fact that the school was quite full they would accommodate the boy because of his difficulties .
when we talk about the needs of the poor , we must talk about the needs of all the poor , because poverty today has no colour .
we need to teach our children to approach a question in their lives with the question : is it right , rather than , is it legal .
whatever the style of governance , the bottom line remains that it must be good governance , and that is what this government represents .
we had fewer victims on our roads in this season just past because we had cooperation from all the traffic authorities in our province .
we watch movies about the holocaust and we declare year after year that the holocaust was an insult to the many jews in this country .
the only conclusion he could come to was that the word of a white man carried much more force than the word of a coloured farm worker .
the committee wishes to commend the department and expresses its appreciation for the quality of the information provided to questions put by members .
we say so easily in the house that we are the best province , we are pioneering and we want to build the nation .
therefore the provincial government will have to do everything in its power to create circumstances in the province conducive to investment from outside .
i quote this specifically because it is my view that this is not a budget only for this side of the house .
i have no problem with the formula that has been determined in accordance with the specific needs of the population , school-going children and a shortage of hospitals .
remember , being a member of parliament is not about just filling a nice soft seat in the house .
i will continue to ask god to help me , with his guidance and strength , and to bestow wisdom upon me to run this province .
the committee wishes to commend the department and expresses its appreciation for the quality of the information provided to questions put by members .
in fact , in total numbers the representivity is satisfactory , but we are lagging behind in respect of the more senior levels .
that legislation will provide for the establishment of a management body for parliament , whose duties and powers will be defined in the law .
the chairpersons of committees , because of their position and their workload , must have secretarial capacity for them personally , staff that they can personally appoint and trust .
if that is so , they should give us a definition of an indigent person and what his or her income is , if any .
if the implementation was delayed six months , how come the system is only going to be up and running in a few months ' time ?
the length and the fairness of a question are there for political debate and i think it would be very difficult to regulate this according to the rules .
people making them guilty of such acts should face the due course of the law and should not expect any support from me or my department .
with that in mind , one can imagine what went on every day in the home of every bus driver who left his house .
we need to absorb some of the elements of the regulations within the act , and at least put something on the table for our local authorities .
i do not think that this is a point over which one should do a tremendous amount of hair-splitting , but we will have to respect what is prescribed for us .
we do have , and i am extremely grateful for it and have said so , additional capital to fund the replacement of obsolete medical equipment .
he comes here and generalises , but he must specifically tell me where it is not happening and i will gladly answer the question .
the commitment of this government is to be a government that creates opportunities and delivers a better quality of life to all the people of the western cape .
i am unable to comment on the balance , but i certainly assume that there is no interest on that at all .
what better way to do that than to pressurise national government to make cape town a free port ?
in fact , time and again it was said that the western cape would not implement a national directive unless it was made into law .
we saw how quickly that spread in a very short space of time and we were unable to curb it .
from this side of the house we would like to engage in that debate and look at methods and ways in which we can remedy the situation .
this is underscored by the fact that the president recently also referred to a greater emphasis being placed on social crime prevention .
where we do have responsibility with regard to appointing members of the police , is the appointment of the commissioner of police for the western cape .
outside this house , and people out there will know this , they all say what a fantastic job the police are doing and that they support their projects .
it has harnessed the expertise of both parties to serve in the best interests of all the people of the western cape province , especially the poor .
we will support the president and the national minister of safety and security in whatever they want to do to fight the scourge of crime .
what i do believe is that if we want to bring up a new generation and be custodians of our children , we need to set the standards .
in the face of increasingly stringent fiscal constraints , we recognise that the only lifeboat available to the branch is own-revenue generation .
as part of this , i will be motivating to cabinet that some institutions which exceed their revenue targets should be able to retain the total additional revenue .
we know that the cinderella might turn into a toad because there is not going to be delivery for the poorest of the poor in this province .
he is not prepared to say that certain portions of land are suitable and that he will ensure that they are released to the poor .
the same measure that applies to one sector of a community must also apply to another sector of a community that has to bear the same burden .
requests from the community are not responded to swiftly enough and the community is not always treated with the necessary circumspection and judiciousness .
only two of us do not belong to the party that is in the majority there , but the cooperation is very good .
in any event , if the house takes a decision on any matter , it does not necessarily bind the executive to execute that decision .
in order to obtain transsectoral inputs from departments , a provincial planning committee has been established with representation from the highest possible management level .
the provincial development council is also represented on this committee and its various work groups to ensure that the inputs of civil society are taken into consideration .
but let us not accuse one another of things or start rumour-mongering , because it is not in the interests of good government .
today the coalition is bringing it to the table and we have heard that it is being supported , and we are doing this in the interests of the people out there .
the public finance management act further determines that such direct charges may only be enforced if so enacted in a provincial act .
if we really want to promote economic growth and create work in the rural areas to counteract depopulation , roads will have to be accorded a higher priority .
our roads today are in a poor situation , and who will pay for the fact that the provincial government have not done their work properly ?
there were some seriously low points in his speech today , and so i cannot actually say that i rise to congratulate him .
they should not tell people to go and register at different places , because the act now provides that they may not do so .
he also referred to the department of transport as one of the departments that are always at the back of the line when it comes to finance .
since traditional products are largely the order of the day in previously disadvantaged communities , the legislative framework will benefit those communities in particular .
our colleagues on the other side of the house are hard at work driving a wedge between the employer and the employee in agriculture .
it has harnessed the expertise of both parties to serve in the best interests of all the people of the western cape province , especially the poor .
we will support the president and the national minister of safety and security in whatever they want to do to fight the scourge of crime .
we must see it only as an interim measure which would allow the parties involved to negotiate and find lasting solutions to the problems .
there are also schoolchildren that are behind in their schoolwork as they could not attend or were late for school due to this unacceptable situation .
the courts are being vilified and ridiculed by people who should know better than to question the credibility of the country 's seat of sovereignty .
children were actively participating in all aspects of cultural activities and they were being made aware of their rights and the dangers that could threaten their lives .
the police were tremendously successful with regard to combating urban terrorism , and i take my hat off to the way they went about it .
firstly , i believe that the purpose for which the funds were utilised was in support of a national issue that ought to have been in the interests of all .
he came here and made a big issue about something and then he told us that no other province had ever paid for volunteers .
when we asked for a full hearing on the matter the chairperson moved to a vote and the whole question was not answered .
given that it is not a loss , but if that money had been given , could we have alleviated the situation there last week ?
that is how the amount was spent , and i presume that it came from personnel for one of the posts that was not filled .
mothers , children and the disabled who have been and will in future also be extremely dependent on state assistance , will no longer receive such assistance .
accordingly my request is that we utilise that and establish a positive programme aimed at systematically eradicating gangs , root and branch .
if certain farmers are refusing that access to a legitimate government department the national minister of labour has every right to raise a problem with that .
as we speak , officials are gathering and verifying information on farms in these areas to enable the payouts .
we are also requested to agree to an adjustment with the admission that it is not yet known what the money will be spent on .
are these requested , is there a programme to look for donations , and what is the policy framework for those organisations that give donations to the province ?
we condemn intimidation , from whatever quarter it may come , because it is not a solution to the problems that face public transport .
she said the thing that worried her was that when she got to school she got into trouble for being late .
i wish to place on record here that not one of those ministers told me that i should not proceed with the act .
we have a transport policy , and in every debate in which i have participated in this house since i became minister , i quote from the transport policy .
the bill consists of a mere two pages , but it is so simply worded that i find it incredible that we almost broke our necks about this .
this piece of legislation has so much positive potential for us that i cannot believe that some of us are still trying to keep it back .
i trust their judgment as i trust the judgment of our other officials and therefore i am very happy and very comfortable with that judgment .
the fact of the matter is that we made use of what the rules allow us to do by initially staying away from that executive committee meeting .
there are many irregularities in this industry , and i think that the operation of small and medium businesses often causes very severe problems among the poor .
i was in a business in which it was clear for many years that when someone applied for a house , there was discrimination against him .
the property rates bill allows municipalities to redress these inequalities , so it does not differ much from the provisions of the municipal ordinance .
they never used it when they did particular or special work and undertakings in certain privileged portions of the community in the municipalities .
these issues have been constantly raised in the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling over quite a period of time since i have been a member of the committee .
the democracy is being charged by the communities with murder , mutilation , attempted murder , kidnapping , rape and murder with aggravating circumstances of young children , women and men .
that is why it must be properly identified and defined and not be used as a tool to camouflage our resentment of criticism .
the constitution calls on us to redress that legacy , and that includes promoting representivity where there was none in the past .
let me quote from the pamphlet : dit is tyd dat ons , boere , werkers en die groter gemeenskap moet saamwerk om hierdie tipe euwels uit te roei .
i understood that we had developed a convention that at the conclusion of a debate the subject for discussion would be put to the house .
the government of the western cape must , and does , fulfil its obligations in respect of every area the constitution requires of us to do so .
in order to encourage youngsters to participate in sport , it is important to expose them to the real situation on the ground .
wards were demarcated in a rather strange way , and even the boundaries in the western cape were not always drawn as we thought they ought to be .
i can only shake my head and wonder what he must think of the national government or the governments of the other provinces in our country .
the mandate of this government is to deliver to the people and i strongly believe that we are carrying out that mandate .
if they want to attack me on a failure to deliver , i shall be pleased to hear their criticism and to take it into account .
let us ensure that the western cape message of prevention , caring and support is projected constantly in the same way so that young and old can relate to it .
the provincial government 's existence is justified by its capacity to maintain the upper hand over organised violence and its power to protect its citizens .
they are purposefully misleading the house just like the national minister of finance misled the general meeting of the chamber of business last year .
one thing that we really must not do is politicise this deadly disease , because then nothing would come of our programmes .
this is how the national government has failed the western cape in failing to secure the safety of our population .
silencing his own members will only speed up his party 's disappearance from the political landscape of this country , in particular in the western cape .
i believe it has become obvious to all that the accuracy of the western cape figures is , to say the least , questionable .
sir , the challenge that faces us , then , is to continue stabilising service delivery in the face of the restraints which i have mentioned .
unless i am mistaken , only one department tabled a policy , and a time frame for other policies to be put on the table .
the other ministers should answer as to why the province is so shy and reticent when it comes to putting their policies on the table for public debate .
as part of the process of the levelling of the playing-fields , we are paying for the fact that we had a better infrastructure in this province .
i believe that the western cape will still contribute much more towards negotiating for women , the disabled and the youth their rightful place in society .
efforts are now being made to recruit skilled people ab initio with a view to running these services on a collective basis once again .
we heard evidence today in the standing committee meeting that it can take up to six years for a case to come to court .
it is not that i have not been on record as dealing with these matters , but that is how they try to attack us all the time .
the department is also requested to scrutinise all legislation it administers with a view to amending possible outdated and unconstitutional provisions .
i will see to it that the administration is invited to testify comprehensively to the committee regarding what parking they can relinquish to us .
i must add that it is a great pity that i have to follow such an excellent speech , because it is difficult to sustain that quality of speaking .
i do not have a report as to whether that short period was specifically dealt with in the previous reports , but i certainly will look into that .
to give some indication as to who benefited , i actually asked the same question , how many people actually benefited from this project .
if we do those things we can send out a signal to the rest of the world that there is a chance for africa to also evolve .
this policy is in accordance with the national minister of finance 's interim strategy , or the ten point plan , seen as the forerunner to the pending legislation .
i am not going to come up with a policy and then find that the regulations have come into being and i have to change that policy .
if i left here today and did something else , it would depend on the circumstances where i worked and how i got there .
the government of the western cape must , and does , fulfil its obligations in respect of every area the constitution requires of us to do so .
i appeal to our leaders in local councils to cooperate with the province in our attempt to create opportunities for rural areas .
today i must immediately acknowledge the fact that the officials in the department of finance have been able to change the thinking of the ministers of finance .
a wise leader that commits his country to war will gather his generals and ask them what they need to win the war .
nobody can tell me how this total was arrived at , what model it was based on or where the model is being practised .
it is not that we are against white or coloured policemen , but we want to see policemen of all races as we enter this building .
they therefore speak terrible untruths and refer to situations that have nothing to do with reality , as though the people out there are dumb .
it will take a very long time to achieve this simple objective in many of our schools , but we will not stop trying .
the committee is led by an eminent and capable educationalist , and i am sure that they will give us a very good report at the end .
what everybody needs to understand is that it is the people in the system that effect change , not ministers , no matter how often they appear in the press .
one could ask oneself a few questions when one considers the state of the schools today , and compare them with the schools of five years ago .
there is , however , considerable evidence to suggest that this is changing fast and that many communities have dramatically changed their attitude toward their schools .
that is really an outstanding way of approaching it and one can learn from their experience and the way in which they have gone about it .
i feel so strongly that i can stand here very proudly this year and say that the officials in this department have steered it through very murky waters .
we know that abuse of the aged occurs in many institutions , and we also know that abuse of the aged occurs in our homes and in the homes next door .
we need to create these opportunities , or we will see more and more sad , lost and destitute faces on more and more of the people of our province .
it is possible , of course , that continuity in this portfolio might have contributed to the fact that housing is one of the fields in which this province has consistently performed well .
where people have money available and are prepared to contribute towards the single greatest investment in their lives , one finds better-sized houses .
people must check their facts before they come to this house and create the impression that this department does not want to allocate subsidies to other local authorities .
in cases in which it is not to the benefit of the community , we will not be able to allow it and a limit will be imposed .
the whole design is such that everybody can see that local government is going to become the order of the day , and provincial government is going to be pushed further and further backwards .
i think the delivery of services is also clearly linked to our understanding of cooperative governance ; how we shall work with national , provincial and local government .
however , i want to assure them that we did take the time to read through it and we do appreciate the effort they made .
i have challenged him to come out with it , whether he wants to do it here in the protection of the house or outside this house .
one can only decide that a matter is controversial when one takes a decision in favour of the objectors or in favour of the developer .
my attitude could have been to say that we must sit tight , not do anything and let the silvermine coalition take us to court .
in environmental affairs , we shall only succeed in our efforts in combating pollution and littering by persuading people to modify their behaviour .
at present industries , farmers , developers and even local governments can do what they like with regard to pollution and there is no one to follow it up .
i am not sure how they are related to culture , and perhaps someone could give me a lesson in culture ; i would appreciate it .
there is a strong demand for quality control in the industry where , by definition , the consumers are unable to sustain pressure on enterprises because they come and they go .
i also want to thank the chairperson of the standing committee on economic affairs , and say that i agree with him about the need for international trips .
it is not contained in the institutional framework , and it has a serious impact on a range of other issues , including liquor , which i will deal with shortly .
as a result of legislation the farmer now has a world of problems to get the worker who does not want to work for him any longer , out of the house .
i realise , too , that the policy of the coalition government does not give them the opportunity to give full effect to development and upliftment in agriculture .
now , as i speak , they are still the most oppressed and disadvantaged group of people , isolated and concealed behind the farmer 's beautiful house with its high walls .
i offered to have an independent laboratory established which could ensure that their products are of the right quality , and they will us .
it should cause more concern for us as a government , provincially and nationally , because we have received the mandate to guarantee the safety of ordinary citizens .
when the national minister of police took office he also declared war against crime , but so far it has come to nothing .
therefore , in reaching my decisions on any matter , i do apply my mind on each issue , but i do not go about counting every rand that is spent .
i understand that he was not the minister then , but in preparation for this act , did he try to find details ?
if savings come from people dying , what steps is he taking to effect the savings , in other words to make savings in the department ?
in the light of what she has just said , does she now concede that there are those kinds of reasons that may take the teachers out of the classrooms ?
since taking charge of this portfolio i have made it my mission to see for myself how crime is affecting the lives of ordinary people .
but , sir , only on monday the national minister of labour made a pronouncement that may threaten the creation of these opportunities for farm workers and their children .
in case the minister does not know , i want to inform him that unfortunately farmers and their workers are dying at the hands of brutal murderers .
i want to thank him sincerely for the positive way in which he leads the government in being a government for all the people of the western cape province .
i myself would love to ask a further question in the house as to compute how much extra money per year we lose because of the exchange rate .
he informed me that he had been bypassed in that decision-making and that he had not even been informed of it until an hour beforehand .
we did not want to go hastily into forming a cooperative , as happened in the other provinces , and it fell by the way .
the answer is no , there is no spreading of the footprint as far as courts are concerned to try to get through the backlog of work .
they said that recent legislation had opened doors for black companies , and presented them with a range of new opportunities and access to new business .
it is time that the benefits gained on the back of apartheid are shared so that we do not have another situation like that .
one would be entitled to ask : is the state able to look after the security of its citizens or must the citizens take the maximum care to protect themselves ?
we all definitely bear the responsibility , with the eyes of the community on us in anxiety and pain , to support this legislation fully .
the actions of an employer who regards his labourer as someone who is not his equal and who treats him in that way , are strongly condemned and deprecated by this side of the house .
in oudtshoorn there has been one case of assault over the past year in which the accused was found not guilty and one case has been postponed for further investigation .
yesterday i must have been still under the impression that it was the opening of the provincial parliament and did not call for notices of motion .
if i live in a particular area , it is expected of me to do my bit to put my party in a better position in that area .
yet there was good cooperation with the demarcation board , subject to the prevailing limitations , of course , and in the end we went through a reasonably good process and achieved the result .
in future things should not be so rushed , and we should not look at the issue only after six months , or a year before the election .
transformation in our province must lead to a situation where the majority of the people of the province are given a chance to prove themselves without prejudice .
it was not because the people thought that it was a good thing , but because they were really glad that they were leaving the hall at that stage .
i hope that the proceedings will be of interest to them and that i will not be sufficiently boring to put them to sleep .
i believe that this year we have improved and broadened this process and that we have taken into account a number of suggestions in the preparation of this budget .
this creates a great deal of confusion , not only amongst the officials and the police who must enforce it , but amongst others who are involved .
what came out in the handling of this issue is that the people on the ground do not care who protects them , as long as somebody does .
i must also add at this point that the department is not assisted by requests from certain people for " queue-jumping " .
i do not know if he was being paid for the work he was doing , but i know he was involved there , and i can find out .
it is our duty to provide the people of the western cape with such leadership and we are mindful of this duty in everything we undertake .
this matter comes up year after year ; year after year it is in the newspapers ; year after year people complain ; and year after year there are certain promises .
i remain concerned that this added burden on our services and the failure of the national treasury to recognise this will prevent adequate budgeting to the poor .
up until now they have not produced one page to inform us about what they plan to do with regard to those social ills .
in addition , the directorate has completed an index of all available facilities on a database , which provides a footprint of where and what sport facilities exist in the province .
there is talent at our schools , where our children are promising and can do better at sport , but there is no assistance at all in terms of funds .
i am certain that a significant part of this effort has been as a result of the contribution of the directorate : sport and recreation in pushing this project along .
but bringing in the death penalty would also need a change in the constitution which states that everyone has the right to life without limitation or exception .
ironically , it also states that everyone has the right to freedom of movement , which is interpreted by some as meaning that there should be no prison sentences .
thereafter we follow the prescribed interaction with labour , which we hope will facilitate the completion of the process by the third quarter of this year .
we had to bring some fun into your speech , to liven up the members on the other side ; they are all sleeping .
for that reason we have a responsibility to help them to surmount these problems and to win them back to the community and to the western cape province .
if she is committed to fast-tracking change in this regard , she must report back to this house within two months about the progress in that school .
that is the kind of creativity i think the department needs to assist it in developing a real strategy for poverty alleviation .
i am sure nobody thought abuse of the aged should be agriculture 's problem , but it must be because aged farm workers also have those problems .
we must give our people hope , but above all a vision of a future void of hardship and poverty , and a future free of want of the basics of life .
we must guard against staff being appointed to municipalities without having the capacity to perform the work .
it is very interesting that when a disaster occurs , our officials are there first to do the work , and the politicians are hot on their heels .
on one point i agree with the previous speaker , that if one wants to see good departments , one should look at the officials of those departments .
it is not that they did not have the mechanisms , and it is also not that they did not have the tools to do the job .
when we speak about development , we must bring development closer so that it can bring about the opportunity and the necessary attitude and in that way we can become attractive to people .
i believe that the life of a minister or a politician is a very short one and one must take the rough with the smooth .
parliament and the provincial administration must make a positive effort to present a service to all its clients in the western cape in the official language of their choice .
instead it is used to further deprive the people , with disastrous effects in election campaigns , and to keep the hand that feeds them in power .
if they were given a cheque , it worries me , as it will cost the administration much more than the cheque issued to those organisations .
if no response is forthcoming , i am afraid that i shall have to recommend that the provincial government becomes involved in cleaning the area .
it is true that it did not count for the previous election , but now i can use it well in my election campaign to canvass votes in my constituency .
there is , finally , the issue of the social charter to determine the type of public transport to be provided , which will also be a charter determining quality .
all i am saying is that as a result of discussions between myself , the national minister of transport and the people at ground level , a further discussion took place .
after that i wondered whether someone else had written his speech for him , because he cannot see what is really happening in agriculture in the western cape .
the first is a new issue to me and most people but , from its severity , evidently not a new challenge .
but bringing in the death penalty would also need a change in the constitution which states that everyone has the right to life without limitation or exception .
ironically , it also states that everyone has the right to freedom of movement , which is interpreted by some as meaning that there should be no prison sentences .
mr speaker , my desire is that history will not judge us some time in the future and find us guilty of a lack of will to do the right thing .
i would urge that we give the teachers the full status that they should be allowed to enjoy as being educators of the people in a healthy environment .
we as an opposition party must say that we have been given none of the facts which would help us to seriously engage with this bill .
accordingly i propose that we adjourn the house in order to get all the necessary people here and then convene a meeting about this once again before the next election .
our concern as members of the provincial parliament is that we have to approve expenditures and we have to apply our minds in whatever decision we take .
i am seriously worried about the fact that when the pfma comes into being , none of his cabinet ministers are going to be ready .
i can answer the question if they give me the time to consult with my accounting officers and then give them the answer .
failure to hurry investment into those areas will exacerbate rather than narrow the gap between rich and poor .
to date , the department of social services has reached only a third of the children they planned to reach by the end of last year .
i invite our colleagues on the other side of the house to join us in being constructive , to go and negotiate where there are problems .
i repeat , we recognise the importance of agriculture but unless the government in the western cape pronounces itself unambiguously against offences of this kind that occur , they simply continue .
can we send in teams to relieve the symptoms and help restore order until the waters subside , as we did in mozambique ?
then there are all those whose details have been captured on the database in the department , those who applied but did not qualify .
when one negotiates in good faith , one expects that the people on the other side of the table negotiate in the same way , but that is not being done .
in regard to our negotiating with the national treasury , surely we as a government have every right to trust the advice of our own senior officials .
in durban , because they did not have that expertise , they actually had to break down various parts of the centre after construction and reconfigure it .
they must protect the right of everyone , irrespective of their social orientation and the judicial system must do more to protect citizens , the vulnerable members of society .
what he neglected to say was that at the time he signed the authority for them to go overseas to attend a conference .
he has characterised his whole approach by " blame and complain " , which has , in fact , added to the problems in the province and not resolved them .
that is not to say that i condone murder , but i am not prepared to prescribe to the judge what he should do .
we have a duty to build a nation that is at harmony with itself , and that is able to fulfil the aspirations of our people .
they made me realise that i would never ever allow my late mother and father to walk that path while i was around .
firstly , i would once again like to make it absolutely clear to the house that i give no excuses for an eighth amendment to the act .
when the hand of crime enters the picture and lives are lost , we can only share the feeling of loss .
that the minister of finance and the heads of department be present during the deliberations on the documents and that departments be made aware of what is required of them .
one has to deal with particular people according to their merit and values and i am afraid to say that some people do not have the ability .
the sense there was that we would negotiate with those people so that they would stop the violence , and we would adjust particular laws in order to do that .
they claim that they talk on behalf of the communities out there and that they want to redress the disadvantages and legacy of the past , but they have no credibility .
they come to the house and tell fine stories about farm people , about how we have to uplift our people and the interests of our people , but what do they do ?
sir , in the situation of farm workers in the western cape and the oppression of farm workers one detects a direct symptom of inherent discrimination , oppression and racism among farmers .
at the moment there are no measurements in place when those people take transfer because central government regarded it as going against the constitution .
i was not going to make a political speech , but i think i have to make a few remarks after what has been said in the house .
this is the main reason why people from other provinces and from abroad are streaming to the western cape , despite the crime and violence that we are experiencing .
the crisis in the agricultural sector in the western cape is a highly complex one , and what is needed is a much more strategic and integrated approach to rural development .
we should give them , as well as the hundreds of volunteer workers out in the field day after day , the credit and the support that they deserve .
we would like to take up the challenge that we want to be a part thereof and make political , mature decisions so that together we can make the western cape a better province .
we would expect the opposition to play a more constructive role and to help the coalition government to achieve even more of its objectives .
i believe that even the opposition will throw its weight behind this process to make it work so that the western cape can reap the fruits of a truly representative democracy .
she should remember that she made statements about issues that she does not support and they are issues that her party voted for in the national assembly .
did he not have the vision and insight to see that that was going to happen and that we should be ready to give assistance and support ?
if that person is guilty of a criminal offence , i shall personally go to the police station and ensure that that person is arrested for the deed .
my press secretary says that he unfortunately did not catch the name of the person who spoke , so it could have been anyone in this house .
there was a point of order that was ruled on earlier , so it is not for the chair to deal with that at this stage .
another matter which i intend exploring further is the current system of monetary penalties which applies for absence by members from official parliamentary activities .
an " as is " analysis , or just figure-counting or head-counting of the present situation , shows that the situation is , in fact , shocking .
the public should be told what level and quality of public services they will receive so that they are aware of what they can expect from the provincial government .
the economy of the western cape is recognised in the rest of the world , and because of that they have asked what we as the western cape can do .
as a good citizen of this country i regard it my duty to report such incidents to the police so that the law can take its course .
we know that the closure of access to khayelitsha caused enormous inconvenience to commuters , as well as having an effect on the economy of the western cape .
last month a girl told me that they could not find lodgings , and were just looking for a way to protect themselves on the trains .
in that way the problem was immediately recognised and contained and the learners cooperated very well in helping us to deal with the issue .
was the tender awarded to the consultancy firm while the department was under the control of the former minister , or was it awarded after the departure of the minister ?
we meet also in the knowledge that the confidence and trust of the public in much of the political leadership of our country is plummeting .
now , six years after the advent of democracy in our country our politics are defined by the ability of government across the country to deliver .
he acquitted himself well of the task of educating us regarding the new legislation , especially the public finance management act .
unfortunately i do not believe that i am equipped to reply to that and i am sure that at a later stage the relevant minister will do so .
i would like to thank all members of the house for their early faith in this project and i hope that they will not be disappointed in the outcome .
their lack of condemnation for the lack of support for the police in this province is equivalent to a stab in the back for the police in the province .
all they achieve in that way is to confuse the community and when they do that then the community fails to provide the police with information that will lead to successful operations .
it is my fervent wish that the efforts of my directorate will go a long way towards ensuring that all people in our province are actively engaged in sport and recreation .
i want to repeat that change in education is a very complex matter , and one must bring people on board when one sets about changing anything .
the numbers of pupils and students studying science , mathematics and engineering at school are insufficient to meet the demands of our country 's developing economy .
it is a disease with so much emotion attached to it , but we must not make the mistake of thinking that if we throw money at it that we will be successful .
we may never be able to win this battle completely , but in a firm , thorough and humane way we should try to reduce and eliminate it as far as possible .
i am not here today to point fingers and to apportion blame , but i must point out that there are certain problems that we are experiencing with the justice system .
this sector places an incredible burden on the local authorities affected , as well as the educational and medical infrastructures , let alone the environment .
i am grateful that the transfer of assets to local authorities is also going to take place in paarl , and that approval has already been granted for the transfer of this land .
i wish , at this point , to thank the provincial development council for the excellent work they are doing in an uncertain climate of institutional change and local government restructuring .
it is not only about tourism , but about economic growth and educating the public on taking responsibility for looking after the environment .
however , we should not repeat the exercise where members are not consulted regarding attractive and creative ideas on what they believe really works .
the budget of this combined department should go back to the basics of drawing up a programme that will assist in the struggle to eradicate poverty .
indeed , they regard it as dangerous to life and limb to travel on that road with petrol , and they will have to think about whether they wish to continue transporting fuel on that road .
like two good neighbours we were able to decide that there was a need at another place , we would look at this and carry on with the work because we have to do our work .
with a new policy that says that wherever people receive their income , they are going to be taxed in this country , they will not want to come here any longer .
we cannot in one sense say we are going to support it and in the other sense say we will just wait , because restructuring is going to take place .
about three months ago i tried to obtain a copy of this report to see whether we could not do anything about it .
as a result , if our agriculturists are not first to adapt to the new technology , there will be few benefits for the provincial economy .
the national minister of finance indicated that the fishing industry would get tax relief but there was silence about the tax relief on diesel which is used for agricultural purposes .
it is true that the farm workers are asking us to talk about them less and make fewer laws about them , but instead do something for them .
however , as soon as a member of one of the two competing gangs is released from prison , that member is often under oath to go and kill an opponent .
i would like to be shown the clause in the constitution that protects the rights of the victim , but there are many clauses protecting the rights of the criminal .
their arguments for this expenditure were firstly that there had been a call by the national government and this province willingly and keenly wanted to assist the national government .
yes , obviously we do discuss matters , but i think it is unfair to expect any minister to know in detail what is going on in all the departments .
how many people volunteered or participated from health i cannot tell , but the same principles would have been adhered to by them , according to all the other departments .
the leader of the house can now advise me , or we can decide together whether a sitting is necessary and whether the house should continue with the sitting tomorrow .
i should like to place the emphasis on effective service delivery and practical poverty relief and alleviating existing distress where this can make a difference .
this is the cornerstone of government service to its citizens , and we in the country have too long suffered under the grip and pressures of crime .
however , clean communities must go hand in hand with economic development , and making sure that children get to school and mothers in homes are not battered and bruised .
if the consultant had given a report which was acceptable to the cabinet , i am sure the money would have been spent by now , but we are being cautious .
acting on his advice and based on what was considered the plight of those people in that area the decision was made to proceed with it .
i would like to remind him that the policy specifically calls for public transport first , which means providing an integrated transport system in the province .
our interest lies with the people , the people who walk long distances to get to the buses and who use public transport on a daily basis .
one thing which has run through the debate like a golden thread is that no mercy must be shown to people who practise violence , intimidation and crime .
i want to tell him that the very day that we finished the debate in this house i wrote a letter to the national minister of transport .
that certainly would apply to us , just as there may be other decisions that other public authorities have to get further approval from others to enter into .
the judicial system needs to be transformed and as long as there is a lack of transformation , people are not going to intervene , but they are going to criticise the lack of transformation in the judicial system .
the result is that the black companies are being forced into joint ventures on projects , even when they have the capacity to do the job .
if we look at one particular square in claremont , that may be oversubscribed , but no one can tell me that about an area like mitchells plain .
it was also indicated that the administration may be exposed to litigation by suppliers who had not been given an opportunity to tender for a particular service .
who does one put on a board of directors , people who have knowledge of the subject matter or people who have never been involved in a business or an industrial company ?
we must accept that people could dislike us for what we symbolise , how we behave , how we dress , our levels of hygiene or manner of speaking .
they will not tolerate any of their members committing certain acts which would create a specific impression in terms of the handling and treatment of farm workers .
when they have to decide between the interests of the farmer who is guilty of ill-treatment and the interests of the worker , they necessarily take the side of the farmer .
the board also expressed its concern that the situation would probably have continued uninterrupted if the department had not been pressurised to submit its application .
one does not just organise the press and take them to the graveyard with the aim of making political gain and then go about shouting reconciliation .
i do not know if i am misinterpreting the atmosphere in the house , but it seems as if there is some form of change looming .
i want to tell them that the difference between them and us is that every single white person that they could get to the polls came to the polls .
in other words , ordinary people talk about race all the time , but leaders , especially on that side of the house , try to take it out of all that they say .
on a daily basis parents , and even children , come to our offices asking us to assist them because the children have been refused access to a particular school .
if one does not have security and law enforcement then one cannot bet on the success of each of the programmes that one intends implementing .
he was saying , by implication , that farmers are concerned about themselves , about their children and about their dogs , and not at all about the other people on their farms .
when i came to serve here , i set out to do some work and to be positive , and i do not think that i have been effective .
at the same time there has been a reduction in the number of paying patients using public sector facilities , and a shift towards the use of private hospitals by such individuals .
i am the last person to claim that there is no racism in this country , or in this province for that matter , and i have taken this up with the president .
however , we are committing large amounts of public funds to increasing the secretariat in this area and i sincerely hope that we will soon see value for our money .
young people in this province fought for the democracy that people are enjoying in this country , and therefore they need a coordinated structure to deal with their interests .
they look , for example , at the distribution between votes , at how personnel issues are approached , and at specific policies of the government and whether the various departments take them into account .
we must value that independence and realise that we do not really have independence if we do not have sufficient funds to oversee the executive .
in this case , however , the law did not take its full course , because it was found that he died of a stroke and that no one could be prosecuted .
when dealing with requests of this nature a lot of our time and our concentration is taken up while trying to get rid of the backlog .
i am therefore unaware of what the benefits would be from anything taking place at that establishment and whether it is being charged for or not .
i do not accept that the people of the western cape need to be divided on the great issues that face us all .
however , it is not always possible to meet goals , because one cannot go out and drown a member of staff in order to replace him or her .
this was especially true for the abused groups aspect because the domestic violence act now compels police to help where previously they were not obliged .
we may make it less sensational , but something that we can speak about passionately in a search for solutions in regard to the safety and protection of our communities .
it is terrible that we have a minister who does not have the confidence of the staff that he has to lead , guide and give moral support to .
not only does it affect their ability to perform their task , it also affects the idea that the community has of them , and this hampers them in performing their tasks .
we certainly will encourage their continuous improvement , but our constitutional obligation is to work towards ensuring that all children have access to a decent basic education .
i have often engaged learners at school gates arriving up to three hours late , and they routinely tell me they overslept ; this is the most common reason .
what prevents us from making a purposeful effort , and displaying the political will , to go to schools and communities and make proposals ?
one of the biggest challenges facing education during this period of transformation has been the development of a system that meets the needs of the entire population .
we simply need to do what is right , because we know that we have the responsibility to get our schools to function properly , especially our disadvantaged schools .
perhaps we need to know what those targets are , and also what plans will be implemented at various stages in order to receive that revenue that we so desperately need .
it is proof that we can really make a difference in this province if we apply the right policies and apply our minds to this concern and challenge .
the original funds came from the national department and the target was to assist the women who became involved in the project to become economically independent .
with regard to the commissioner for children , a report will go to cabinet outlining our progress and the framework of what must appear in that piece of legislation .
yet , we see that this amendment was delayed for more than a year , endangering the prospects of thousands of tenants actually to become owners .
madam , if the municipalities fail in their service delivery , the province will also be failing , as will we , as members , in our attempt to render services to the people who need them .
we on this side of the house would like to congratulate the demarcation board on the great task that they have tackled and completed in a most responsible and transparent fashion .
perhaps what the department can do is draw up a manual to educate the people regarding legislation and provide the judgments that can influence their decisions .
i should like to thank all the law enforcement officers in the province and in the local authorities for their hard work and the zeal with which they are implementing the law on our roads .
we are not going to use that money for schools or health , nor will we use it for welfare , we shall use it to maintain our infrastructure and carry out further maintenance .
we want to see the results , in that when he talks about job creation and the growth of new businesses , we want to hear what is happening about blacks and women specifically in this province .
it hurts one that even when one opens up a knock-and-drop one finds murder reported .
we are very happy to say rhetoric is really important , but when rhetoric is not backed up by action , we must really scrutinise the rhetoric .
after all , we had outstanding results in the western cape thanks to teachers and officials who were at their posts , where communities required them to be there to render service .
i am almost sure that every other minister will do exactly the same , because i would not expect ministers to answer a question that they cannot .
secondly , what instruction was actually given to all departments about the amounts of money , because we have different amounts of money given from each department ?
this became more and more evident during the election campaign last year when we as public representatives spent more time in the communities that we serve .
as chairperson of the standing committee on health , social services , office of the premier and corporate services i wish him well and look forward to our future collaboration .
therefore committees should be cautioned that if there is an agreement , and specifically on a contentious point , changes should not be made unilaterally when it comes before the house .
we know it is a national competency , but we wonder whether the game is being played according to the rules in our province with respect to subsidies for the existing operators .
this process goes to the extent of asking people to help , outside people to come into the process and help to find solutions to the problems .
can anyone in this provincial government or any of the people in the government have anything to gain by fomenting the violence , or even allowing it to continue ?
however , we think that the bill should be accorded priority and that the agreements should not at any time be used to prevent the bill from going the full course .
i am confident that the bill in this form is right , besides being necessary , and i request the house to approve and support it .
there is no limitation on the provincial legislative institution as regards establishing all the types of municipalities , as worded in the local government : municipal structures act .
we shall continue to make use of every constitutional and legal tactic to ensure that the standing committees perform the constitutional duty entrusted to them .
the black contractors have complained that the banks view them as being particularly high-risk business , and these requirements are applied in a far more stringent manner than for their white counterparts .
we have also said that the major enemy facing this city , and this is also linked to the rates issue , is the fight against poverty .
these are areas that we shall have to look into and that we shall have to give support so that they can at least pay salaries to their people at the end of the month .
sometimes people are killed and tortured in front of other family members , corpses are found to be mutilated , people are tied up before they are killed and women are raped .
when things happen like the events of last week , it is human to be concerned , it is human to take fright and , yes , it is human to be afraid .
these are not rhetorical questions , but questions of vital importance to the people of the western cape , especially in relation to transformation of the workplace and equal opportunity .
his attitude of expecting and demanding obedience on the part of his employee gives the employer no right , however , to regard that employee as an inferior individual or person .
let us put right what is wrong and give the necessary support to those who are in earnest in making a success of agriculture in the western cape .
i want to ask him why they turn up in court in large numbers when a white farmer is charged , and not in all other cases of assault as well .
i also wish to take the opportunity to thank our constituents and members in the province for their hard work in producing some very good stabilised election results .
when i contacted him about it , he said that we should look at the regulations and decide what was to happen and in what way we could pursue the matter .
they did that in the election campaign when they told so-called coloured people that they are not white enough and they are not black enough .
we made the promises , but we did not think of seriously investigating the administrative machinery required to keep them .
i want to express the hope that the future will take us into a new era in which we can move away from words and illusions and into the world of hard work and delivery .
the probation officer has to look into the trauma experienced by the worker , but does not look at all at the trauma experienced by the employer or the other workers on the farm .
therefore , having learnt all these lessons and being ready to graduate into the new public finance management system , it should be supported by everybody in the house .
i do not think that i or anyone on this side of the house should adopt the attitude of closing our ears and not listening to what is being said .
they came there just as they disrupted the opening of parliament this year , and last year , and the issues they use are not real issues .
it is only human , unfortunately , to accept the good things as self-evident and to give more expression to the things that bother one and make a big fuss about them .
i want to make it quite clear immediately that it is unfortunately not in our power to put most of these things right , because they arise from factors outside our control .
however , with their commitment and their presence on the buses , i am sure they will go out of their way to try to look after the safety of the commuters .
it is an issue where we were initially much criticised and questions were asked as to whether there was any inconvenience to commuters on the day of the closure of ranks .
in a discussion with the chief whip we had an understanding that the questions as they stand on the question paper would be cleared today at this session .
does he support the principle that a minister who has resigned from a position may then immediately take up a position as an employee of a company that has been awarded a contract ?
time spent on searching premises in vain can be much better spent and the community 's cooperation in this regard is earnestly called for .
can we truly trust a white lady to do this job who , after six years , produced nothing but an insult to the constitution ?
i think we can safely say that the national government is driving policies , but the province is implementing them very badly .
it is interesting that this happens most commonly as a result of a lack of the necessary expertise in financial management and financial administration , and often as a result of a lack of any training in financial administration .
that is my attitude , and that is why i believed that it was necessary to do so , with one amendment that i made to it , which he agreed to .
in some cases the late start to the school year results from the fact that students return late from the eastern cape , and this bad practice is widely regarded as a valid excuse .
we hope to make a good start on it in the years ahead , but this project is of such a scale that it will outlive my term in office .
instructions were issued in the department and officials went to regional offices , gathered together the senior staff there and told them that this was so important that it was a national issue .
i further would like to put on record that at scof this department was one of the few departments which had a clear plan in respect of their programmes .
i participate in the debate today , having considered the budget and in particular having studied the policies that have been used as guidance in making the allocations .
this while the poor of the entire country , which is governed by them at national level , are really suffering and not receiving essential basic services , food and so on .
they came to visit my office in order to place something on the table in terms of how to resolve the problem relating to the youth that leave school early .
in terms of a national agreement , the departments of health and social services has therefore been tasked with the responsibility for children infected and affected by the disease .
i would also like to thank them for their presentations given to us in scof and to the standing committee on social services , office of the premier and corporate services .
this is a moment of great joy for us in the province in anticipation of all those other communities and families who are going back to their land or will be given compensation .
at this stage , i think it is also useful for us to discuss how will we most effectively deliver services in this local government that is to be set in place .
i have found it both absorbing and exciting , and i am dedicated to ensuring that the portfolio is managed in the interests of the total population of this province .
we shall have to break away from the way in which we tackled things in the past and create space to enable more effective service to our people to come to the fore .
this is a fine example of private initiative , the state and the regional services council cooperating with the contractors who will build the road , where each makes its own contribution .
an integrated programme driven by the department of transport and public works would be a movement towards finding a lasting solution to this matter .
this reminds me of the national legislation that was approved about two years ago when the former national minister of transport wanted to pass a piece of legislation every second month .
this collaboration has amongst other aspects been reflected in them taking the subcontractors to exhibitions overseas to see how products there are developed and what the market demands .
the primary objective of such a coordinated programme is to save valuable foreign exchange by promoting import replacement and exports , it will also be capable of creating many important new job opportunities in the western cape .
i was worried about the fact that the national minister of finance made concessions for the fishing industry but did not make the same concessions for the agricultural industry , which creates so much employment .
it is not only a case of certain people have rights ; all the people have rights and we must protect all the rights of all the people in this province .
i have also heard this afternoon that a communist supports the capitalist system and i think that in this house many things are going to happen this year that will cause us to ask strange questions .
and matriculants who failed could ask : was it not perhaps as a result of a teacher who was engaged in registration rather than applying his task of education ?
i believe that this is the only way in which we shall really be able to create a mechanism with which to contribute significantly in respect of the whole issue of unemployment in the province .
as the chairperson has corrected one or two points , i think we can accept the report that is before the house is as changed by the chairperson .
if they feel so strongly about the matter , they must go and speak to the president and ask him to replace all the judges who come out of the previous dispensation .
i have other examples , for instance of people who fought for about five years to obtain capital from banks , and who then became extremely successful in a computer company .
we say these are access to finance by black business , which has been described ; and the redlining of and consequent discrimination against coloured and african areas .
we are taking that kind of tack because this is a very important issue that we are busy with and , as i have said , it is important for the economic development of our people .
i really appeal to both sides of the house to give the person who is speaking an opportunity to speak and be heard .
if the best course of action is to appoint a commission of inquiry in terms of the provincial act which provides for it , then i will not hesitate to do so .
criticism is being hurled to and fro and there is a constant struggle and dispute as to who should be given the credit for the successes and who should be blamed for the failures .
what this means in real terms for this ministry and department is that there will have to be visible and tangible changes in the way that people experience the environment and culture .
as the government of the day we govern all the people and they are all our citizens , regardless of which constituency they come from or who claims to represent them .
it is a reality that the confidence and trust of the public in the political leadership in the country and in the opposition in this house is plummeting .
in the course of events , an important element of obligatory cooperation developed between colleagues and municipalities as they realised that they had to get local government moving .
let us invest in some kind of budget now to save millions of people in the future , not only in rands but also in morale , compassion and dignity .
had they taken part in the debate , it would have been different , but they do not take part in the debate , and would rather have a private debate going .
after sentencing , the offender is the responsibility of the department of correctional services , which determines the desirability or otherwise of release , based on its own mechanisms and criteria .
we had three national ministers here , because at that stage they could not refuse to renege on their duties , so they were forced to come to a meeting .
the issue crucially here is that part of the community did not want their children to go to that school because they were protecting jobs in the other school .
there has been a conflicting view within national papers of the definition of disability which has , thus far , made it extremely difficult to complete the classification of this designated group .
we are looking for investment in this province and in this country , but we do not allow the people with the expertise and the money to come into the country .
it is imperative that we find solutions , and i believe that our colleagues on the other side of the house can once again make sound and illuminating contributions in the effort to find solutions .
it usually helps if teachers are qualified , but some unqualified teachers put enormous effort into their work and do a good job , while there are qualified teachers whose performance is far from satisfactory .
past policies must shoulder much of the responsibility , but there is far too little evidence that schools themselves are playing the role they should in reversing this .
the problem is therefore not in the model necessarily ; it is in the data that gets fed into it by the people who are supposed to give it to us .
local authorities are just as guilty in this regard , because they are insisting on high service standards as they are left with the responsibility of maintaining the services that are installed .
this parliament should know that this is a source of considerable concern to me and that i shall leave no stone unturned in my efforts to redress this situation .
one can see that we really need to pump more money into this component if we want to facilitate the approval or rejection , whatever the case may be , of these applications .
yes , it is true that when people have no reason to attach value to the environment in which they live , they will also accept no responsibility for their broader environment .
a popular culture , in my opinion , means a culture that appeals to the youth in particular , but is popular in our communities in terms of the number of people supporting it .
one of the more difficult aspects that we are having to deal with at present , particularly as a result of the lack of good and comprehensive information in this regard , is the appropriate approach to the development of specific sectors .
it is imperative that we find solutions , and i believe that our colleagues on the other side of the house can once again make sound and illuminating contributions in the effort to find solutions .
i will give him the answer , and if he thinks the answer is not right , there is the standing committee on public accounts who can do their own investigations .
many innovative ideas have led to the most fantastic evidence of people being given an opportunity to advance themselves , with aid and assistance from the department and , of course , other departments of the government .
in cooperation with some of her council members she makes positive efforts to investigate such practices and address them so that the farm workers need not come off worst .
on the other hand , i also appreciate that he may have left it to his ministers to elaborate on them in this session or perhaps during the debate on the main budget .
any rational thinking person would surely ask the following questions : does that mean that whatever results come out of the testing period will not be taken into account ?
our vision is of a safe , prosperous province in which no one is left behind , and where every citizen has access to the opportunity to improve the quality of his or her life .
i certainly have the fullest confidence in the departments and the detailed information they presented to the standing committee , and i am indeed very happy to support this appropriation .
i estimate that it will take another three months after the bill is approved by the house before the appointment of the commissioner , possibly by the middle of this year .
now that , we believe , is unconstitutional , because one cannot , by getting one licence , be guaranteed of four licences , and we believe that needs to be looked at .
however , the point that i have been trying to get across to the house is that new contributions are going to be made by different parties from the parties who are the parties to the current agreements .
evidence heard with regard to various cases of irregularities where officials of the administration were involved indicated that , in most cases , effective finalisation of disciplinary actions still did not occur expeditiously .
as a result of the measures proposed , illegal operators will now no longer be able to argue that they are not permitting gambling but merely conducting social gambling with no gain to themselves .
sir , i want to begin with the last part of the motion before the house in which an appeal was made to me for those farmers to be suspended as members of organised agriculture .
we were aware of the initial convention where we simply ended the debate , but then we raised this matter and looked into the issue of putting motions to the vote .
we must remember that our people correctly demand integrity in political leadership , and it is our duty to provide such leadership not only in the province but throughout the country .
i am not alone amongst my finance colleagues in other provinces who question the reliance on these statistics for the allocation of provincial shares of national revenue .
we have , for a while , been speaking about members of parliament not being able to fulfil their constitutional requirements , and thereby not serving the citizens of this province .
we will support him in trying to push that police station to a higher priority , seeing that it was given a lower priority by the former minister at the time .
it is important to note that governing bodies must take responsibility for the management of safety precautions , and are empowered to develop and adopt policies for their schools within the framework of the national education policy act .
our vision is of a safe , prosperous province in which no one is left behind , and where every citizen has access to the opportunity to improve the quality of his or her life .
in partnership with the city of cape town and other committed local authorities , we will ensure the establishment of a municipal police presence in the city and in towns across the province .
there are further investigations in progress and should information come to light that affects the situation , the department will certainly act to protect the environment where it is feasible in law .
often she has had to take unpopular decisions , but when they are justified within the guidelines laid down , and the successful education of our children is always put first , the choice appears to be easier .
there were no instructions issued from any national office , nor was anyone ever given an instruction , to my knowledge , to say that the national office issued any instructions .
when he sees the outcome he will agree that our actions were entirely justified and necessary across the system as a whole , but we do not need his agreement to do it .
in fact , in the western cape we have kept the trend in check significantly , but we have to ensure that people are able to make the choices they wish to .
yes , the western cape is the best place to live in , but it is also the best place to get ill in because we are running a good service and we are very proud of that .
we see this in so many municipalities , where the administration collapses on account of a town clerk or a chief executive officer being appointed from a low rank and not being able to do the work .
they told all those people owing money to the council to go to the bank and sign an undertaking stating how they would pay it back , and then the bank would pay the council .
i am not going to dwell on this issue because it has been discussed here ad nauseam , suffice to say that we should make sure that as many eligible voters as possible are registered .
however , if recent legislation does bring to light that we need to review the situation for technical irregularities , i believe it is only right , and i will always support it .
it may be a duplication , and we need to be careful when it comes to duplicating funds for maintenance because a duplication of that magnitude could be to the detriment of the province .
however , how do we handle those industries which have traditionally been strong in the province , for example the clothing industry , but which have been suffering in recent years , inter alia as a result of cheaper imports from the far east .
let us forget for a moment about this kind of racism that is still there and think only about the economic or financial interests which dictate that they will not easily allow competition .
i would be quite happy if that were indeed the situation and no other member of the cabinet was here , because otherwise it would tie them up for two or three weeks .
bokkie does not have a written contract with her employer , she does not get annual leave and with the birth of each of her children she was not even entitled to maternity leave .
it is unfair to ask ministers to report on their portfolios when they were not the responsible ministers at the time when this expenditure we are questioning was incurred .
let me say here that i wish particularly to acknowledge people who went beyond the call of duty voluntarily to implement our policies in education last year .
let me say there are two other areas in the city which are of enormous concern , because they have really become the battle grounds of gangs controlling other areas .
there is little doubt in my mind that during that tragic period of our history , elements in the security forces were stoking up conflict between the warring parties in the run-up to the first democratic election .
the children have to walk along the long row of buses and among crowds of people , enquiring from bus to bus which one is likely to take them to their nearest destination .
i think that as the law says this is going to bring us major dividends in terms of foreign investment because many of the people who come here have never been in cape town before .
i give my word of honour that i was at no time approached to delay the matter , nor did i at any time ask anybody to delay it .
the members of the intelligence service must surely move among the people and listen to what they are saying so that they can hear when anything suspicious is mentioned or discussed and can see suspicious behaviour .
all i can say is that others may hate one but it is only when one hates them in return that they become winners , and racists should never emerge as winners .
unlike their white counterparts , they cannot pick and choose from venues and facilities which are nine times out of ten in close proximity to their houses and fully resourced .
it is important for us also today to look at what was done and not just talk about what exists , what we are going to do and what we are going to look at .
it reminds me of the saying that one should rather be quiet and appear a fool , than to open one 's mouth and remove all doubt .
we must concentrate more on our similarities than on our differences in order to deliver an even more satisfactory service to the people of the province , especially to the poorest of the poor .
we believe that if government deserves credit then it should receive the credit due , but we also reserve the right to criticise when we believe them to be wrong .
nobody in this house can say that because they are in opposition , their job is to ensure that the government fails in improving the welfare of the people .
i want to refer to one aspect which ran through his speech like a golden thread , namely cooperation , and in particular cooperation with the community out there and outreach to them .
my own view on this issue is that the hands of those people that are coming from the eastern cape have built the wealth of this country , all the wealth of this province , for all of us .
they said that when five people are shot in constantia i am there like a shot , but when five people are shot in a black area , i am nowhere to be seen .
it is time for us as a province to take our role seriously in nation-building and how we are going to redress that aspect of apartheid and assist other provinces in that regard .
this will go a long way toward affording us ordinary members input into what could be a growing and exciting aspect of the new global economy .
we further encourage the roll-out of the cabinet to the people , the project which aims for the cabinet to hold its meetings outside cape town at least three times per annum .
they cannot expect the minister in the office of the premier to go to every little settlement every day to give and disseminate information with regard to the domestic violence act .
the provincial commission of enquiry into the recent fires , as well as the national commission appointed by the minister of water affairs and forestry , will investigate and report on the issues raised in the question in detail .
imagine if the families of those people that have died were sitting in the gallery , and we were not prepared to admit that there was definitely unnecessary delay .
perhaps there is something we can come up with which we can suggest to the national minister of finance , something that can be included not only for this province , but for all provinces .
all we have done is to say that we will get them more , but we do not look at permanent benefits for those people who are so necessary in this province .
however , we must strive to bring this down to a more realistic percentage to allow us greater focus on the all-important field of economic and infrastructure development .
some of it is fairly technical , but for a layman such as me , it certainly helps that they are willing to go the extra mile to explain the technical aspects to us as legislators .
by giving people ownership of land and assistance in building their own homes , we are in essence giving people back their sense of self-worth and pride in themselves and in their surroundings , province and country .
i would like to state in the house today that i have no doubt that when i considered this application i did diligently apply my mind to the facts of the case .
the question is how to make the process transparent and to see to it that it occurs in such a way that the political interests do not become as important as the other interests .
the only problem is that i do not know if the commissioner will indeed be able to be a bridge between planning and the environment , as there may be many technical problems .
i am not sure if there is legislation in place to enforce the placement of these stickers , but if there is not , i think it should be considered .
in fact , even in the case of several of the larger hotels , the bulk of the capital is mobilised locally or nationally , with only the marketing and the management linked to international firms .
however , we must strive to bring this down to a more realistic percentage to allow us greater focus on the all-important field of economic and infrastructure development .
what people are beginning to say very clearly is that this government might be the best for the few , but it is in many ways an enemy of the many and of the poor .
on the second day on which the bill was discussed , i said immediately that i agreed with the provision because i had considered why it would create an impossible situation for me .
it is my endeavour to tackle every problem in the spirit of direct involvement and with immediate action , with a sense of urgency and with the aim of finding a solution .
however , the entire country and all sectors of our people are looking to the president of the republic to outline the priorities and way forward for this country , which includes the western cape .
i am prepared to examine the permits , but i am not prepared to be pressurised by instructions of having first to dispose of this before that is done .
the key thing is that if there is a conflict of interest which impacts directly on the financial dealings or transactions of a member they must recuse themselves , and they will do it .
there may be a danger that one is simply obsessed by the murder and does not try to identify whether there are other things that gave rise to the murder being committed .
we have not asked him to resign and we have not asked that he be fired , although i do not think that he is of the appropriate gender as the minister .
initially when he started to speak about it i became excited , but when he dealt with it in only a very narrow way with regard to farm workers and their children i became disillusioned .
for the first time in our history we can now be assured that steps can be taken to lighten the burden of women in their struggle in raising their children .
on every occasion i went out and talked to the traffic officers . i went to visit the scene of every accident so that i could analyse the situation and encourage our people to work even harder .
that is not a true reflection of what is going on and it proved that he is not in touch with the people that he is supposed to be leading .
in particular , as the report outlines , the education department has found a way of presenting information and its budget to the committee in a manner that is understandable to us .
i hope it is not a case of " new brooms sweep clean " , because i saw them starting but i did not see them finishing it off .
may i at this point thank the department of education , and more specifically the coordinator of the safer schools campaign , for their great willingness to ensure that this coordinated strategy is becoming a success .
to be sure , much of the blame can be laid at the door of past policies , but this does not explain the great differences in performance between various historically disadvantaged schools .
programmes and campaigns like these would not only give orphans the second opportunity to a family life , but it would also lessen the financial burden on the state and develop a more caring community .
i would like to appeal to everybody here today to give us the necessary support and motivation to continue with our good work and to make the best of a bad situation .
many of them might sound good in speeches when a minister comes here , but when it comes to the actual practice and reality of implementing those processes , they are often , as i said , unrealistic .
of course this relates to the slogan he invented last year which told us that the environment must come first , the environment must come second and the environment must come third .
from time to time one is faced with decisions that are not so obvious and as evidence and arguments are gathered from different angles , the decision becomes increasingly more difficult .
how can we , as the provincial government , be at the cutting edge and be expected to direct policy and mobilise people if we are not in tune with what is happening globally ?
the people whom we as members of this parliament represent must be shown that we are in control of this province and that this sort of behaviour will not be tolerated .
what of the old persons of this area who invariably use public transport to take them to day hospitals and clinics , collect pensions and do household shopping ?
the minute something goes wrong , central government say the western cape should have done something , knowing that we do not have the resources or the power to do so .
the process that has been created by the provincial parliament is that scof should deal with all these matters and all detailed questions in regard to every cent that has been expended by the department is answered in scof .
if voters were registered , and if it did not mean that the department of education lost money in any significant amount , i think i am quite entitled to support the bill .
as the motivation for this money raised earlier in the debate was to avoid taking teachers out of the classrooms , would she not agree that that was a spurious reason ?
it is true that many parts of this city 's community are smothered with a blanket of criminal intent , where in many ways the writ of the state no longer runs to its fullest extent .
it is encouraging that this government has committed itself to creating opportunities for farm workers and their children in particular , and to see to it that the farmers remain productive and profitable .
may it be a pleasant year for all of us and may we all cooperate in a positive way to make a difference to the lives of the people out there who watch what we do here .
in other words , one must take a great deal of care that one is not receiving a donation to be spent by the province if we are actually doing business with that organisation , or business is being done .
municipalities will therefore not be able to impose very high increases because the bill gives the national minister of finance the right to cap those increases .
inhabitants of the rural areas are increasingly becoming the prey of criminal elements and because they live in remote areas , this remoteness contributes towards their being exposed to these criminal elements .
they should know that while i may not wave my hands and raise my voice , either in the house or anywhere else , i am passionate about delivering to the people of the western cape .
it is his function , as leader of the opposition , to be in this house to listen to the debate , but yesterday also he made his speech and , immediately afterwards , walked out of the house .
the non-partisan attitude of the staff instils confidence in us as legislators , who know that under trying and exhausting conditions , this underresourced team manages to give us effective support .
a year down the line we find that in fact the truth has been spoken , but they do not indicate here that a year down the line the situation had actually worsened in terms of coloured and african representivity .
if one takes this argument to its logical conclusion , it may be said that none of the other provinces have the powers either , but they are nevertheless showing better results .
we are now ready to roll with the implementation of the new curricula , and we only await the completion of the national framework within which to implement our plans .
shortly i shall be inviting the members of the standing committee on health , social services , the office of the premier and corporate services to call on these hospitals so that they can see how our hospitals have improved .
they do not attend school and cannot in turn end up building a better society or even becoming able to contribute towards society and will end up being a burden .
if recent developments in the field of law prove such a decision to be inconsistent with the facts , i believe it right for the applicant to make such an application to correct the technical irregularities .
it takes political will to go to a community where there are two libraries and to tell them that it is time for one library to be closed so that only one service is provided .
we hope that the establishment of the new board will go a long way to unlocking the potential that lies in the natural resources of the province for the economic and social development of our province .
it is important , therefore , that all the people here who are so wealthy and drive around so happily in their fine cars , must buy personal number plates so that we can collect money to improve the roads .
the absence of any objection from the other side of the house means we must accept that the process that was followed to register everybody who was not registered was a fair process .
therefore , i am not going to take the opportunity of meeting an official in the corridor to find out what the answer to the questions may be to give the accuracy .
i think that we who live in the city will never grasp the pain , misery and suffering of the people in the rural areas before we visit them , speak to them or work with them .
and this is the civil service that will have to ensure that service delivery in those communities that we were speaking about earlier is actually done efficiently and effectively and with a sensitivity to the needs of that area .
i believe that the racism and discrimination that we will be dealing with , and the challenge that we will be faced with , will be racism or discrimination based on social classes , that know no colour .
i shall try to follow the advertisement that is to be placed in the sunday newspapers over the coming weekend and i shall look forward to the results that may be realised towards the end of this year or early next year .
we were blessed with having a remarkable individual as our leader who transcended the boundaries of party and race and put principles above politics , and service above self .
right at the outset , allow me to say that when i listen to the arguments advanced here there was not one person in this house who was in favour of racism .
the point i wish to make is that they went into this process with a preconceived view that there was no way that they intended voting in any other fashion , and it was a filibuster .
a word of gratitude is due , too , to the people of the western cape for their understanding and support for our endeavours to deliver the best levels of service we can within our limited means .
she said she did not think she had a chance of getting her matric in the eastern cape and was therefore desperate to get into a school in the western cape .
the time devoted to this budget attests , firstly , to their seriousness and thoroughness in analysing the budget and , secondly , to the degree of adaptation required by the new , although easier , format .
over the past week it has been a special privilege for me to attend the meetings of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling where the various departments explained their policies to us .
the public should be consulted about the level and quality of services they receive from the provincial government and , wherever possible , should be given a choice about the services that are offered .
it hardly provides for material benefits to the people of this province , because the scope and powers of the province and its responsible minister are severely hampered by the national competency in this regard .
he has given me reports on the situation at that school , but because i have not cleared this with him i obviously do not want to discuss the contents of those reports here in public .
i would like to thank him very sincerely for his commitment in repeatedly visiting our schools and trying his best to analyse the situation in those schools , so that we can give our support .
it began a few years ago , and its aim was not only to bring in money from the residents , but also to uplift municipalities and extend service delivery to the communities .
an objective analysis of the department of development planning could raise the question of whether this department would not function better under the department of local government , as i mentioned earlier , under which it fell before .
i can switch off the light at night in peace , because i looked at the facts and i believe that that was the right decision , even though it may have been against the political decision of my own party .
we believe that there is a place for the ballet , opera and orchestra , but it must be in the context of the realities of the province and not at the expense of other legitimate expressions of culture .
may i say that as far as the rest of the country is concerned , i am not privy to that information but i do remember strikes having taken place because the volunteers were not paid .
the attackers do not merely intend to kill the victims , but instead to inflict pain , humiliation and suffering , especially on elderly people , and not sparing women and children .
we are accused of not having fed this child regularly and of not affording this child the necessary support by means of the powers at the disposal of the defence , the state .
on how many farms do they not sit around a table in the morning , before the employer and his employees have begun their activities , and ask the almighty creator for strength to perform their daily task !
i do not see the logic in equipping an army when the possibility exists that soon there may not be soldiers to man that army or to use all that expensive , sophisticated equipment .
that is insulting because it fails to recognise that someone who comes from mpumalanga and who cannot speak english is able to make a contribution in this house or in the national assembly .
i believe that conferences should be representative , and in so far as conferences not being representative and not having all members of the public from all areas involved in tourism being there are concerned , that i would certainly condemn .
i think i should add that he spoke about the poor without even explaining his class background and what , in fact , he and his family have done for the poor in this country .
i told him that i believed it was important for us to sit down and think , think and think again in order to find a way of increasing our own income within this province .
if we take all the waiting-lists in the western cape and make one waiting-list , we will have to take into consideration the fact that there are people whose names have been on the waiting-list for many years .
transformation cannot , however , take its rightful place if the legislation is not there , and it is our plea today that that legislation should not be held back any longer , but that we should get transformation going .
i know that crime and violence are colour-blind , but one wonders what measures would be adopted if the wave of crime and violence were to occur in white areas , as is experienced in the cape flats at present .
the reason we say so is that this issue and what is behind the bill result , firstly , from political manipulation ; secondly , from a lack of financial control and mismanagement ; and , thirdly , from a cover-up .
how can they be expected to give a reply in the house as to how the money was spent if it was given for one purpose and one purpose only , the registration of voters .
the alternative that we want to suggest , in agreement with the chairperson of scof , is that we postpone this discussion and then call for ministers to come forward with detailed answers to the questions that have been put .
not only did we drop the number of casualties during the festive season on our roads , but there has been a very significant reduction in the number of people arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol .
certainly , the apartheid government also tried to threaten me and i was arrested and charged with being in a so-called black area without a permit and given a six-months ' suspended jail sentence .
something else that was very clear was the fact that most departments were prepared to work together with the standing committee in readjusting their programmes or drawing up new ones.that was very encouraging .
i think we are being asked to write a blank cheque on this question , and that the house must avoid at all costs getting into the habit of writing blank cheques .
i think we must be careful when we make pronouncements or try to evaluate a pronouncement , particularly when we do not understand the context within which the case took place , and i say that with all due respect .
in this context equity does not mean equality , not given the fact that the discrimination of the past was designed to and did in fact benefit the white community whilst depriving the black community .
emphasis must be placed on the fact that violence on farms is part of a broader context ; a context in which our society is trapped , be it on farms , in towns , in large cities or on the cape flats .
perhaps in a year 's time we as a provincial parliament can then say that we are a provincial parliament for all the people and that we have managed to do something in at least one particular area .
let us put the interests of our women , disabled persons and youth in our poor communities first and ask that these be reflected in every budget that is submitted in this house and not only in mine .
the various stages of legislation in respect of the necessity of a committee of the whole house and the necessity of a third reading have been questioned for some time , and the subcommittee will also look at this important matter .
this question should be referred to the office of the premier because it is an initiative that emanates from his office and , therefore , they would have the most up-to-date information on the questions raised .
the press imputed remarks to me when i had conducted no interview with them and made no statement to them , and now all of a sudden i am responsible for what the press writes about me .
in conclusion i would like to say that with the approach that has been taken , we on this side will continue to give our support to finding a lasting solution to the ills of the public transport system .
it means that the government by way of the provincial department will make sure that the payment from the budget is appropriate and is in terms of guidelines that have been laid down , including the elimination of possible corruption in the system .
we have waited three years , and we would like to start focusing on departments of that type , because that can be done in this province , and we would say that that is where we need to go .
we are also pleased to see that more money will be spent on social crime prevention , because social crime prevention is definitely a sound investment ; one cannot lose by that .
although the first three objectives focus primarily on departmental staff and activities , this does not negate the department 's responsibility regarding service rendering to persons infected and affected by the disease .
in one town in my service area , the name of which i do not wish to mention now , someone at the traffic department apparently came across this regulation one day and decided that that was a nice way to make money .
i simply think , from this government 's side , that we should not only keep to the agreement struck some years ago before my time , but we should actually go substantially beyond that .
the standing committee on economic development effected certain technical amendments to strengthen the hand of the minister in implementing the new legislation which we shall no doubt all accept today because the other parties agree on this .
it is clear to me that when we are in a standing committee meeting we speak one language , but when we take the platform and face the people outside , we speak a different language .
if , on the other hand , they came up with some projects with regard to safer streets , i would fund them to the tune of thousands of rand , but all they want to do is misinform the people .
if we do not receive answers as to how the money was spent , could you explain to me from the chair how we can authorise unauthorised expenditure without any information at our disposal in the house today ?
unfortunately i do not have the full information at my fingertips , but if my memory serves me correctly , the money which we spent in regard to olympic matters was national money and we were acting as agents .
the report that we have before us and the report as tabled by the chairperson of the standing committee of finance , development planning and gambling is not the same as the report that has been circulated in the house .
if a party is honest and sincere with its voters , surely it must say that it has a mandate , and if the other party is so inadequate , it must be able to put its point of view right there where it matters .
the second aspect i wish to single out is that there is no problem in respect of the fact that the province administers the money , however little it may be , in accordance with the correct accounting principles and practice .
the question that i struggle with , with respect , is that when we come to the meetings of the standing committee on the full budget , where we will go through every programme , there are then three officials sitting in front of us .
we have set ourselves the goals of significantly improving service delivery to the people of this province and transformation of the way in which we do our business and the way in which the concepts of environment and culture are defined .
the absence of the media , be it the printed or the electronic media , was shocking , particularly after i had approached the president to hear why they had not invited the media to promote this cultural history .
i , in fact , checked with my department in the limited time i had this morning and they indicated that all of this money was spent on wages for people working in this campaign .
that is something that we have to take into account as a province when , of course , our national leadership say or do things that discourage foreign investment and affect the exchange rate that has a major effect on our budgets here in the western cape .
however , i would like to say that there was also in particular one departmental official who took the approach that they would not bring information to the committee because they did not expect the committee to ask questions .
it was also noted that financial information and statements that had been submitted were not scrutinised to determine whether objectives , for which the assistance had been granted , had been achieved or that financial probity was properly exercised by the institutions .
while i agree with his sentiments , how is it possible from where he sits to encourage our citizens to think and act like winners , while he is heading a coalition government of losers ?
i am hopeful that the information gathered through this process will assist in alleviating the problem and that it will not be another ploy to throw money at research in solving the problem .
they have been doing excellent work in this regard and are actively involved in remedying some of the social ills perpetrated against children who work with children daily and should receive support from the provincial government .
it is not too late for them to begin not only to work according to what they have in mind , but to make a contribution to the freedom of their people , so that the people can change .
i am not trying to denigrate matric ; it is an important exam and must be retained , and congratulations are due to the many people who work so hard to try to maintain the western cape 's good track record .
they have to send a team in there to clean up the mess as soon as they possibly can , because without that the police and the community leaders outside can cudgel their brains day and night but they are not going to solve the problem .
all we want to say here is that such negotiations , we hope , are informed by the need to allocate those funds to a function for which they were originally allocated , namely infrastructure in sport for the citizens of this province .
the thought immediately arises that if the national minister of safety and security and the minister in charge of the national intelligence agency cannot perform their duties or guarantee the safety of the inhabitants , we must question their ability .
the effect is that international investors now sit back and say that they will bring their expertise and money to the province , but if the government is not prepared to assist them , they are not prepared to come .
some educationalists argue that there is evidence to suggest that the larger the scope of the change and the greater the demand placed on the individuals involved in the change , the greater the chance of success .
it troubles me to notice that in the face of the high unemployment in the western cape , which inflicts suffering on the poorest of the poor , both black and white , this department no longer has job creation as one of its priorities .
i also think it is the duty of the state to uplift those people in the communities that try to convey these values with integrity , to champions in their communities and to accord them the respect and appreciation for what they are in fact doing .
other people who under the cloak of a free-market system exploit some of the most defenceless people in our province and in particular in our rural areas , the rural poor , will also have been satisfied and reassured about their future in the province after yesterday 's speech .
i was involved in the discussions , and it was there that we decided to consider the future of our people and what we were going to do about it , because the labour party was no longer the vehicle to carry the coloured people .
there can be no doubt that the benefits of sport participation for our society will extend beyond an active healthy lifestyle to areas like addressing the antisocial behaviour of our youth and assisting in the concept of nation-building .
fiscal austerity and prudence within all departments have ensured that the transformation and adaptation to the requirements of the new public finance management act should be achieved with more confidence than were possible five or even two to three years ago .
i would like to thank the executive for already consulting the members when the ball is still in their court ; for the fact that we can make an input before the budget is finally drawn up , and that we get the opportunity to make suggestions .
in other words , we may , with the best will in the world , set out to arrive at the actual figures we have set , but we cannot take out a shotgun and start shooting people in order to replace them .
the problem , of course , is difficult to quantify , although it is estimated that for every four children seen on the street during the day , three are children on the street , which means they go home at night .
we will have to determine whether we cannot service sites on the land that is made available and utilise the funds at our disposal in an orderly fashion and in such a way that people are given the opportunity to erect structures on the serviced sites .
the advantage of belonging to a small party is that one is forced to speak virtually every day and that is the best way in which to gain proper experience and not to behave like this gentleman over here .
if we receive additional information on matters , i believe there is a time when we are required to turn around and say : yes , the process was not right and having taken senior counsel 's opinion , we must now take a different route .
black business will never be able to succeed in an environment where , based on the fact that they are black and not , i would argue , solely on the application of business principles , there is little or no access to finance .
the major problem confronting us today is whether they feel insecure or threatened , and whether they think they would not really be able to hold their own in an executive committee , where they would truly have to care about the community out there .
out there they say that first they were not white enough , now they are not black enough ; then they must hear that they do not have the necessary expertise , and the latest is that they are not developed enough .
there are countless interesting opportunities that derive from our experience in managing this year 's budget and a full written analysis of our department 's performance will be made available to the house shortly after the closure of the books for this financial year .
we aim to reach consensus on this and will engage expert technical and professional advice from outside parliament in order to arrive at an end product which will not only be accepted by all of us , but be to the satisfaction of our constituents as well .
in fact , when the act refers to regulations , it provides that certain things will be prescribed in those regulations , and these are only the formula , the amounts of contracts and which points will apply to those contracts .
are there times when the province decides to interfere in local government , and other times when it decides not to interfere , and when does it decide to interfere , and when does it decide not to interfere ?
i have tried to argue for the white middle-class to stay in public schools , support them , use their expertise , use their resources , support other children , provide bursaries to those schools and do such things .
by the same token , however , if it is so critical , it would have been nice to see his colleagues in the cabinet support him more by listening to his speech , because what his department does and creates will influence each one of their departments .
i want to ask him to look at agriculture in the western cape with different eyes , because agriculture in the western cape has the passion to help our people so that they too will one day be in the position to become commercial farmers .
with the greatest respect , at the end of the day illiterate people cannot be put into the field alone because they cannot take statements , they cannot take reports over the telephone , they cannot write and they cannot drive a motor vehicle .
with reference to this example i wish to state clearly that i do not belong to a party which stands somewhere and holds a revolver to my head so that i have to impress people and even perhaps say things which go against my principles .
i appeal to all the political parties in this house not to try to put a spoke in the wheel of his honest and sincere efforts to be the premier for all the people in the western cape by way of short-sighted and selfish political objectives .
it has been found that informers are reluctant to provide information as to the activities of illegal operators , many of whom enjoy the protection of complex , organised networks , if payment will be forthcoming only upon conviction of the person in respect of whom the information is provided .
if that is the message we are communicating , we are sending out a signal to our people that they may as well fall into despair because they cannot trust their political leaders to unite , even on such a grave threat .
however , i believe that the ministers are responsible for giving political guidance to a department and that a minister has the political and moral responsibility to see to it that we try as far as possible to give effect to the constitution .
that the house calls for a report on the progress made in recovering the amount owed by the hon minister of social services for the continued payment as minister for the six months after his removal from the provincial cabinet .
we in this province should be relying on the national government to give us the national and international confidence and status to advance both this province , and this country in fact , in improving overseas investment and tourism as well .
it is an unfortunate fact that when it comes to crime , there is a tendency to describe the problem constantly and to express regret at the terrible circumstances of the current situation , but without following up with effective proposals for solving the problem .
we have approved projects far in excess of the funds that have been made available to us by the national government and we expect to continue to roll out the delivery of housing as fast as the funding makes it possible .
despite the fact that i attended very few meetings of the standing committee , i am able to contribute constructively in this debate thanks to the work they did for the committee and the patience they showed .
we are pleased that , with one or two exceptions , all the municipalities in the province have accepted the process and its results , and that everyone is apparently cooperating in processing the legal , administrative and practical effects of the demarcation and putting them into operation .
the provincial treasury opted to table this bill after it was certain that the direct charges provisos in the public finance management act were not affected by any proposed amendments to the public finance management act .
for my part , i want to affirm publicly that i have confidence in the integrity of the people who are there , and that i will personally be vigilant in seeing if there is any conflict of interest and demand that people recuse themselves .
it also demands of the employer and the employee in these changing times to make time for one another , to dream together about ideals on the farm but also to surmount disappointments on the farm together and to convert them into opportunities .
they should know that this government is inspired by a cause , and that cause is to meet the needs and aspirations of all the people of our province , so that the future will really be better than the past for all the people of the western cape .
no matter whether they say they offered it to us and we did not accept it , or whatever the story is , it is a situation which fundamentally affects the ability of the coalition to govern .
if there is one lesson that the liberation movement taught people , it was not to accept their lot patiently and meekly , but rather to join in the struggle for the better life that they were promised and that they are now demanding with increasing impatience .
i agree , the same people , all of us included , who come from a poor environment and have experienced poverty at its best , have been mandated by the poorest of the poor to act on their behalf and to take action on their behalf .
i also remember very clearly how members of this house treated the senior officials of this department with great disrespect , not at all believing that they were capable of running or even knowledgeable enough to run the department .
the committee heard and considered evidence with regard to the lack of proper financial control caused by the shortage of experienced and qualified staff at various departments of the administration which , year on year , has shown no improvement and which may result in significant losses .
as the investigation into the affairs of these operations is at a very sensitive stage , i do not want to elaborate any further , save to say that certain parties have been charged with criminal offences and that they will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law .
this will also require him to get to the middle of the river and extend his hand , just as it will require us to go to the middle of the river and extend our hands as we meet one another .
the committee wishes to express its appreciation for the submissions provided by the provincial departments , and commends them for the quality of the information provided to the questions put by members , and thanks the provincial ministers who attended with their departments .
the committee wishes to express its appreciation for the submissions provided by provincial departments , and commends them for the quality of the information provided to the questions put by members , and thanks the provincial ministers who attended with their departments .
one must realise that , because of our country 's past , in the constituencies where we come from people are forced to make use of public transport or their own cars in order to get to work , as people were relocated far from their workplaces .
the committee noted with concern the problems that were highlighted during the process with specific reference to the process followed , timing of the process with regard to the distribution of documents and the discussion thereof , and the structure and format of the process .
when i confronted the chief director of economic affairs regarding this issue , he said that the reason they bring all the officials to the debate is to expose them to how the budgetary process works , which i think is a very noble answer .
what is publicly known is that the national commissioner pledged to assist in the problem by sending additional reinforcements to this province and at the same time pledged that some military personnel would be made available to us , and that those additions would be funded nationally .
although the leader of the opposition was entitled to secretarial assistance , the specific expenditure had not been budgeted for , since a government of provincial unity was in place in the western cape and the office of the leader of the opposition did not exist at the time .
they are waiting to hear whether he is prepared to tell the house that every time an assault has taken place , he is prepared to take a stand and ask organised agriculture in the western cape to take those rotten apples out of the basket .
the great advantage of this is that that bill goes back to the specific committee which has been working on it all along , while our current practice is that the whole house decides on that bill , even though that standing committee received all the inputs and listened to everything .
i will then be able to look at it and assess the accuracy or investigate that information , and then look at the contract and see whether the contract can be terminated in the event of the information being strong enough to terminate such contract .
a patient who has been robbed and stabbed in the face , having gone through the psychological trauma of the experience , arrives at hospital , and then gets told that his life is not in danger , so he or she must go and find a day hospital for treatment .
what makes it more ironical is that these incidents of violence specifically occur at a stage in the history of our country in which we are engaged in establishing a culture of human rights ; a culture in which everyone has the right to free association , security , a job and so on .
i am aware that there are initiatives under way at the national level by the ministers of finance and for the public service and administration to get a tighter grip on this situation , and i can only wish them well in their endeavours in this regard .
we are calling on the house to call on organised agriculture to ascertain whether the farmer involved in the alleged attempted murder , kidnapping and assault of this sixteen-year-old child from a farm is , in fact , one of their members .
now i am asking the central government and the national minister of safety and security not to simply voice their opinions , but to keep their word and do what they have said ; and from our side they will get the assistance they are getting at the moment .
given the reports from most ministers administering services within the poorer areas of our province , it is clear that there are huge strains on all our social services as a result of our sisters and brothers from other provinces and countries seeking a better life in the western cape .
otherwise it would have required the impossible from me to get a place where i could keep vehicles under proper protection in a pound and in so doing prevent further claims from being brought against me or the local authority , if the vehicles in the pound were to be damaged or stolen .
i said that if i had gone to cabinet with our policy and started to implement it , i would have had to come to cabinet again a week to three weeks afterwards , whenever the regulations came in , in order to change it in the light of the regulations .
what makes it even more ironic is that our national ministers and even our president spend weeks and thousands of rands helping other countries in africa to become reconciled with their terrorist groups but do not see their way clear to entering into discussions in their own country with terrorists groups that they identify .
then there was the faade at the meeting of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling yesterday , where we did not have a proper process which defined what the money was spent on , how many officials were employed , how and where they were employed and what their functions and responsibilities were ?
we on this side of the house will honour their memory by making sure that the issue of racism is highlighted and the struggle against racism continues until we have rid this country of this awful disease reflected in the madness of the opposition to football being played at newlands .
however , while some of them are helping to make democracy work , there are others who simply have no idea of what democratic government entails , and i sometimes marvel at the fact that they are public representatives in a party that claims to have been the vanguard of the struggle for democracy .
the great asset of true democracy is located precisely in the ordinary businessman , the administrative official , the man in the street , the worker and the professional person being given the opportunity to see the values that are important to them established for the sake of their future in this western cape , which we all want to see grow and stay beautiful .
unfortunately , and this is true , vandalism is not viewed as a very serious offence , and many vandals are accordingly not apprehended , because of the crimes that are of a far more serious nature in the eyes of the police in many communities and the lack of available resources to follow up on all reports of vandalism .
in accordance with that we should be able to enter into discussions with certain schools that in the past have had the best and ask them whether , in an effort to be constructive , they did not wish to cede part of the monetary allocation to their schools so that we could channel that money to the schools that needed it .
we know it is the intention of the province to sell off this land , but we hope they will not do that without considering the views of the organisations and people that have participated in a long process to decide what will be the best use of that land .
sir , political will is what tells me that when schools begin to empty , school buildings that can be used can be converted from those schools into office space that would cost us far less , but which could also serve as a resource centre or a place where other functions could be provided to teachers and pupils .
to create the impression today , however , that a promise had been made of a provincial law and that that promise had not been kept , that we are apathetic , that we are slack and did not do our work , is devoid of all truth , and i want to put it in that perspective .
i think that for too long it has happened that the churches have become institutions standing on the sidelines , and even criticising the government , be it provincial or national , about a community that is experiencing social decay whereas the church in essence has the responsibility and duty to help to build character and build communities .
considering this central location in the city , near the national parliament with the national council of provinces , with which we are in constant contact , and the cost of another building , which we could not impose on the taxpayer , i think that we should not seriously contemplate another home , unless we can obtain a recently completed building .
when i came before scof i told them that we are ready to present the policy , but i am not prepared to present a new policy on procurement when the government has come up with a new act and that act provides for regulations to be put in place .
if civil society is not given an active role in that , not only might the framework not represent the interests of the whole province , but it might also lead to another controversy where we have civil society and local government standing against the provincial government for a framework that it wants to implement .
more than at any other time that we can recall in recent years our people have a need to know that we are really doing everything in our power to make them safe but also that we have the will to give each of them the feeling that they belong to society and that their interests are also being looked after .
i would hope that the other speakers talking on this motion will be prepared to support a call by the house that it is in the interests of organised agriculture to make such investigations and to send out a very clear message that organised agriculture in the western cape will not tolerate this from their members .
we had hoped that by now the national cabinet would have given us some direction because we do not want to end up in a situation where the provinces have come up with a policy on gender and at the end of the day national government has come up with its own policy and then we have to amend or put our policy aside .

i shall come to the hon member mr ozinsky .
perhaps mr naud should also write something about that .
valuations are something about which our people are very sensitive .
] the hon member mr byneveldt must be patient .
] this does not really allow us to make progress .
i have respect for the hon member mr dugmore .

the hon minister - what is in a name , after all ?
blaauwberg has yet to produce its financial statements .
do hon members know that oostenberg has 13 executive members ?

another issue i wish to address is disaster management .

we have too many procedural points on these issues .
but was the hon minister absent from cabinet ?
the hon member ms essop should put her question .
nevertheless , i would like to respond to the question .
madam chairperson , i would like to ask a follow-up question .
my understanding from mr fourie is that the amounts were reimbursed .
we have dealt with the adjustments of the 1998-99 financial year already .
however , hon members should not make extensive statements .
the adjustments appropriation for the 1998-99 financial year was dealt with last year .

the provincial commissioner of police must be held accountable .
sir , farm workers want effective housing with basic facilities .
they are responsible and carry out their tasks with dedication .

the hon premier said , and i quote :
the provincial aids council will be a unifying forum ...
the hon minister raised an issue pertaining to crossroads .
the people who are stopping the development come from unati .

the hon premier is not alone in that assessment .
let me mention an example to the hon premier .
next , mr speaker , i wish to discuss farm murders .
sir , the submission by agri western cape yielded shocking statistics .
this r400 million ends up in the pockets of the thieves .
will they stop the exodus if they close stock theft units ?
this means that farmers have scaled down on their permanent labour force .
did the anc merely want to announce it with such a fuss ?
yes , the hon member mr dugmore was there too .
yesterday they were satisfied and reassured by that speech .
the hon premier said , and i quote :
mr speaker , the facts are briefly as follows .
sir , we are very proud of the hon premier .
i would like to remind hon members of such realities .
we are , however , being destroyed by the greatest threat ...
south africa is not under threat of any military attack .
only this time the attack on him was stronger .
mr speaker , this sends out a good signal .
we now talk about " transversal departmental management " .
mr speaker , but it is worse than this .
mr speaker , may i ask a question on that ?
yes , the hon member is most welcome .

our suspicions are founded on the fundamental belief ...

are we dealing with incompetence or straightforward gobbledegook ?
the department of finance is the lifeblood of this province .

all those workers are gauteng based people .
that hon member keeps asking about a policy .

why does the hon member not get up and conduct ?
amstelhof is one of the poorest parts of paarl .

in his core objectives , we see exactly what he is trying to do .

we want to innovate and go the right way .
hon members know the history of the municipality of oostenberg .
the speaker took the chair and read the prayer .
i believe that if the motion read , " ...
a consistent picture of cruelty and insensitivity emerges .
the final regulations have still not been published , however .
it is clear that one of the reasons for this ...
mr chairperson , i would like to return to the southern cape .
mr chairperson , dassenberg teaches all of us a couple of lessons .
the pdc plays a very important role in the province .
i am here at the discretion of the hon premier .
what i said was " environment , environment , development " .
the hon member should please understand what my principles are .
i remind him of the latin dictum , " festina lente .
" translated it means , " hasten slowly .
i just want to speak to him about the integrated development frameworks .
the hon member mr isaacs talked about the review board .
i will draw his attention to that when i see him .
i want the hon member to understand that .
i have therefore approached environmental affairs as a human rights based issue .
an amount of r865 000 has been allocated for this purpose .
out of 370 outstanding cases , 147 were used for this study .
these sentiments will be reflected in our annual provincial cultural awards .

i take it that that will be dealt with in the committee stage .
sir , we are not dealing here with shacks and shelters .
we are speaking about dwelling houses - there were 125 000 dwelling houses .
therefore , the pedestrian management plan is being developed for implementation in april 2000 .
i am pleased to know that this has been incorporated .
this will effectively save our city r1,5 billion .

they tend to be the same people who pay income tax , ...
" but even that the dp does not find satisfactory .
the first aspect i wish to consider is rates .
they called it the robin hood approach to the matter .
where does the " public good " begin and where does it end ?
he referred to plattekloof and welgemoed and to parks .
i want to ask him where the anc council is .
the hon minister of local government and development planning may continue .
the rates were determined in accordance with the valuations in those areas .
poverty among farm workers is the order of the day .
we have just gone through the trial of the franschhoek killers .
good guard dogs remain one of the cheapest and most effective deterrents .
this is something which south africa can ill afford .
however , i should like to see farm murders within that broader context .
( vii ) cultural laws second amendment bill [ b46-2000 ] .
the speaker took the chair and read the prayer .
mr speaker , i move without notion , notice ...
mr speaker , i abide by your ruling .
western cape eighth gambling and racing amendment bill [ b11-2000 ]
mr speaker , i repeat the extract from the report :
western cape ninth gambling and racing amendment bill [ b12-2000 ]
the rules also prevent these children from gaining access to the gambling floor .
mr speaker , while all of us in the province ...
] it is controlled by the hon member 's coalition partners .
in the task team we also developed an understanding amongst ourselves .
mr speaker , two issues arose in the task team .
the new np , as we all know , has a corruption barometer .
do hon members know what the new np has done about that ?
] and i know that makes the hon premier feel ashamed .
i will tell hon members why i say this .
the hon member mr mckenzie can say what he likes .
that the house , noting that -
right now , his participation on the board ...
] there is also an allegation which , remarkably , is correct .
let me read what the draft code actually says inter alia .
let me tell hon members this .
] the hon member has missed a few things .
a copy of this letter was sent to the director-general .
that hon member would not understand , i am afraid .
( x ) higher education amendment bill [ b55-2000 ] .
the speaker took the chair and read the prayer .
in the good old days , in the previous regime ...
do they have evidence that it was pagad 's action ?
yes , but the hon member says nothing about gaddafi .
this is the gravity of this debate in the house .
muslims are well represented in parliament and cabinet .
is this country hostile and unfair to muslims ?
we are told that we are apparently delivering hate speech .
we gladly submit that our pamphlet does represent hate speech .
that is a misquote !
it is the hate speech that comes from across the house .
however , the anc of today is a different creature entirely .
as far as we in the da are concerned , equality is indivisible .
today they profess the greatest love for this nelson mandela .
you would like to see their backs , especially ozinsky ' s .
i still fight on the side of democracy , ...
i am an african , and who can deny me that ?
it does not make me a racist if i ...
] premier , if i were he , i would rather be silent .
i could give you my definition of it , mr speaker .
] oh no , no one can place me under pressure .
" and received the reply , " i am the devil .
" then he asked , " but why are you crying like that ?
why then did freddie mercury of queen die of aids ?
] but you say that aids is caused by racism .
the speaker took the chair and read the prayer .
( a ) the high unemployment rate in the whole of the overberg region ;
- the roll-over of unspent funds from the preceding financial year .
- r0,5 million to fund capacity building for housing personnel ; and
mr speaker , may i read my motion without notice ?
that the house , noting that -
because the anc fights racism , people say that we are racist .
" on many farms " is what i said .
] i will if the hon member wants it .
a farm where the farm workers earn r150 per week ...
those are the people to whom those hon members are referring ...
] i am not even referring to that hon member .
the hon member mr isaacs knows what the truth is .
the hon member mr fransman may carry on with his speech .
the farmers in the country did not want it .
in the western cape there is a committee that is looking at state land .
the hon member mr dugmore repeated that four times .
organised agriculture takes its own decisions as it sees fit .
in south africa there is no minimum wage for farm workers .
( iv ) judicial matters amendment bill [ 63-2000 ] .
final version of the western cape fiscal policy : 2001 - 2004 .
the speaker took the chair and read the prayer .
to have insisted on summoning the ...
mr speaker , it is our contention that the real purpose ...
] this is not the house of johannes mahlangu .
mr speaker , the rules of politics are mostly unwritten .
there were time schedules and time-slots for what we had to do .
mr speaker , what i am saying is the following ...
i believe that this cabinet took the correct and brave , ...
the other emphasis in the 1999-2000 main budget was placed on service delivery .
this has meant that we have had to reprioritise our original budget plans .
the speaker took the chair and read the prayer .
ma-ndize kumalungu ale ndlu nawo ndiwanqwenelele unyaka omtsha ozele nga-mathamsanqa .
it is not true that the anc is hiding corruption .
the da should not play party politics with this issue .
she only goes to crossroads to stop development .
i now wish to refer to the question of the unicity commission .
many hon members alluded to where the developments are taking place .
] in gauteng we control 97 % of local government .
we are not referring to the word " gender " .
mr speaker , the political landscape has changed in south africa .
racial solidarity is all that the anc can promise its followers .
] let us ask about what has happened to smartie town .
he gave a truly theatrical performance here today .
he had , at least , the insight and vision ...
that fact is this : the reason we took the matter up ...
surely he knows how hard we fought about pre-emptive rights .
actions of this kind put important questions in the mind of john citizen .
the da is blue and the anc is shown as an orange colour .
mr speaker , the western cape is blue - very blue .
mr speaker , the western cape is unique in many respects .
mr speaker , i am certainly not reading the newspaper .
mr speaker , the hon premier spoke about security .
i would like to see the challenge taken to manenberg .
i want to express my utter rejection of that in this house .
mr speaker , i cannot believe my ears .
anc speaker after anc speaker has expressed concern about the race card .
how can he come here and talk about the struggle ?
] the polling booth was not far from his home .
now the poor things have only 77 members in the unicity .
the da should take full responsibility for actions like this .
but we are there and we will still be there .
i would like to congratulate the hon premier on his opening address .
i know of anc members who obtained a legal opinion on this .
he went , and they gave him r750 000 .
that is r750 000 in taxpayers ' money that they wasted .
dr botha will be back at work in plettenberg bay on 1 march 2001 .
] that , at least , is something that she saw .
] now they have to clean up the mess .
the speaker took the chair and read the prayer .
i hope that the hon ms brown listened attentively .
] he does not even know where the light switch is .
the hon leader of the opposition should watch his back .
the house will now adjourn until monday , 5 march 2001 .
the speaker took the chair and read the prayer .
the principal of the school clinic is karin reed , a psychologist .
i want hon members to pay careful attention .
it is an abuse of power by the hon minister .
does the department now count the number of muslims in each school ?
no one can know whether that is a muslim school or not .
at that time the principal of that school was a fervent muslim .
it is an unjustifiable and indefensible blot on her career .
we have already sent it to the muslim judicial council .
many of these economies are larger than the south african economy .
she made a big fuss about that in the media .
more importantly , it must be administered on the basis of equality .
and i will remain those hon members ' worst nightmare .
why are you involving the iec in a political debate ?
then it should not be running campaigns on voter registration .
but we are not going to zimbabwe with the money !
the hon minister knows very well what he has withdrawn .
mr speaker , the fifth pillar is safety and security .
an hon member may only put a point of order .
mr speaker , i would like to give a personal explanation .
in the dp we acknowledge that there are different styles of governance .
it is because they insult the intelligence of the electorate .
i am referring to those soldiers who were stationed in namibia .
those battalions and sections were dismantled between 1980 and 1997 .
] hon members on that side of the house ...
we are not asking for an apology from the hon member .
mr speaker , i would like to say what happened .
mr speaker , say to the hon premier ...
it is a trend originating in the anc .
we could go on about how much contempt they have for democracy .
] is that the way to serve the community ?
i am bitterly disappointed in the hon member mr ozinsky .
if that is so , why is the crime rate so high ?
two of these points have already proved themselves here in cape town .
in both cases , it will provide investment opportunities and create jobs .
] we can guess why , but we want answers .
true democracy is and will remain the western cape 's most important marketing product .
business suspended at 13 : 02 and resumed at 14 : 21 .
mr speaker , let me rather come back to reality .
today , in this house , i want to give recognition to nehawu .
that is no longer done in the new np .
] why did the anc not do something before ?
they want us to forget all those issues .
] i walked into a shop in swellendam on sunday .
] my title is not the minister of education .
we know how the hon premier has dealt with those issues !
they have said that it is the anc 's baby .
well , maybe the hon premier should have boasted a little .
] he did not , but let us leave it at that .
he wanted to know why the " dronkies " were not being arrested .
he said : " that is not good enough .
this correspondence originated from an indian in the company .
] it is quite clear that the policy remains the same .
what happened at the opening ceremony of the western cape parliament ?
is that the kind of national pride we want in south africa ?
an hon member pointed out that it was deadly .
the old dispensation of racial and class privileges must be eliminated .
an hon member : he did not go to work .
the hon member mr fransman may continue with his speech .
up until today i have not received any acknowledgement of receipt .
a government that is threatening to nationalise agricultural land without compensation .
why is the hon member mr king so worried , then ?
the hon member mr fransman must continue with his speech .
the new np , even with its new name , remains the np .
that adds up to an exemption rate of 39,4 % .
there are 191 pupils at the vredendal and clanwilliam secondary schools .
the matriculation exemption rate is 5,76 % - at our schools .
this sinking ship does not , in fact , get tired of gerrymandering .
madam speaker , will the hon member take a question ?
she belonged to the new np at that stage .
he may heckle if he sits in his own bench .
the hon minister and the chief whip must take their seats .
i listened with much amusement ...
the speaker took the chair and read the prayer .
the western cape is heavily reliant on transfers from the national government .
this has been done through three specific mechanisms -
the increase in motor licence fees which will be allocated to roads .
( e ) other fees and charges - r45,180 million
( d ) r2 million from unsolicited bids and taxi permits ;
fourthly , we must look urgently to the building of infrastructure .
i would also thank my finance colleagues from the other provinces .
] i thank them all , individually and as a team .

the afrikaans edition will be available by 7 march 2000 .
sir , 40 people are unemployed as a result of this maladministration .
thank heavens , at least that director-general has been fired .
they got nothing - he is in the power seats .
the new np supports the idea that quality services be rendered .
that is why we have a growth rate of 4 % .
danger signs of unemployment are a cause for concern in the western cape .
we noticed that he kept on referring to " bullets " .
mr speaker , broadly speaking we support the budget .
of this r33 trillion , r13 trillion are from the bond market .
it is unfair that most of the construction workers come from gauteng .
they pass the casino and see the construction work .
unfortunately , my door remained open and nobody walked through .
mr speaker , i would now like to deal with the scof report .
i thank scof and all hon members of the house .
we learnt a lot at our first cabinet to the people meeting at pacaltsdorp .
it was the american , james weldon johnson , who said :
it was another american , frederick douglas , who said :
i must say that the western cape boasts an outstanding budgeting record .
the information revolution does not only have negative consequences .
general administrative training will be rendered on a centralised basis .
sometimes their fathers and their brothers act as pimps for them .
i therefore propose the following to the hon minister .
this morning we had a presentation by all the departments .
a coordinated research programme and planning and development activities should be undertaken .
however , it seems that at the scof meeting she had no business plan .
then , r1 million of that amount was shifted elsewhere .
mr chairperson , why is there inertia in this department ?
we are in a cooperative agreement with the austrian government .
the other country that we have a cooperative agreement with is bulgaria .
] he must sit there so that i can address him !
can hon members grasp this now ?
that is true , but dr barnard has given his undertaking .
i am very grateful for the support in this regard .
] they can decide whether they want to come along or not .
] we are not selling it to our people ...
] it is legal , and they can go and see about it .
she referred to the bulgarians as neo-nazis .
she was asked to withdraw that statement ...

however , mr mcotshana died in hospital that monday .
they do not care about farm workers and farm residents .

surely , mr speaker , this is a travesty .
now that transformation is going to happen , she calls it window-dressing .
was the hon member referring to anyone here in the house ?
mr speaker , i was , but i withdraw it .
however , the hon minister of housing was misleading the house .
it is to retain certain positions in the pawc .
those hon ministers have been doing it their way .
regarding the transport consultative forum , that is an ongoing process .
do hon members know how many people have died since that time ?
mr speaker , the answer is , in some cases , yes .
mr speaker , my question is basically about a principle .
mr speaker , the unconstitutionality is to be found in the regulations .
the unconstitutionality is in terms of the regulations and the direct clause .
mr m ozinsky asked the minister of environmental and cultural affairs :
( c ) various enterprise budgets have been provided by officials .
mr speaker , i would like to move a procedural draft resolution .

the hon member heard what i said previously .

it is a well-known communist practice to indoctrinate children .

the anc , together with their political delinquents , have delayed delivery .

where neighbourhood watches are functioning efficiently , significant declines in theft have been reported .
i want to ask the hon member mr ismail about worcester .
this is one of the main principles on which chrysalis will be based .
none of those community police officers has a medical aid .
i do have authority , however , over the selection of the community police officers .
it proves that those hon members do not understand the system .
if they were to go and stand by the bodies of members of the police ...

why is none of that money being transferred to the housing fund ?
what kind of society is this hon minister producing ?
why must there still be some people who get the short end of the stick ?
madam chairperson , these are semi-detached houses consisting of 2x2-roomed dwellings .

in the 1999-2000 financial year , 10 out of the 23 planned audits have been concluded .
today i also wish to address an urgent request to hon members .
another great challenge is the credit control policy at most municipalities .
the great challenge , however , lies in the implementation of the credit control policy .
the province , government departments , district councils and municipalities are represented on this committee .
in many cases the action taken is reactive rather than proactive .
i think it is pioneering work in this field .
i want to refer to an ethos of local government service delivery .
we all know that a municipal systems bill is on its way .
we will have a district transformation forum in each of the five district municipalities .
] that hon member will soon have a chance to speak .
i wish to congratulate the metropolitan area in the form of the unicity commission .
we know what the transformation process in 1996 and 1997 cost .
in conclusion , i would also like to thank hon members of the house .
here i have the document drawn up by mr epstein .
and he said that the performance policy system was one of his objectives .
seeing that i am riding the oostenberg horse , let me mention something else .
oostenberg is the smallest council and oostenberg 's days are numbered .
the hon minister said that we should have the money ready .
madam chairperson , what is the acdp recommending regarding local government elections ?
madam chairperson , i want to pick up the point about fire-fighting .
the hon member mr dugmore moved away from my field somewhat .
mr speaker , can the hon member just repeat that , please ?
mr speaker , with your permission , i move without notice :
i am sure that it will be announced on tv tomorrow .
mr chairperson , i have been allocated very little time .
we of the new np seriously object to that statement .
lower ranks are defined here as junior management and lower-level supervision .
it is a decision for the hon premier .
the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs , however , is sidelined .
mr chairperson , i wish to devote a few minutes to libraries .
madam chairperson , the polluted river water flows down to the sea .
in some instances , certain organisations are given r80 and r30 .
let me read to hon members the kind of activities we are funding .
yes , i agree , we should look at environmental education very seriously .
the hon member also referred to the independence of consultants .
i share her passion about combating hiv / aids .
i hope that answers the hon member 's question as well .
did the hon member ask a question about gays and lesbians ?
from that side of the house the interjections are extremely lengthy .
] and perhaps a sample of some sexy underwear !
the people could have had the r7 500 subsidy long ago .
it is of course unparliamentary and hon members should refrain from it .
the assessment of such things should be left to the speaker .
mr speaker , that hon member was caught in a trap .
this is a reflection of the coordinated law enforcement programme in the western cape .
another point i wish to single out is that of vehicle registration plates .
in this regard i wish to extend my sincere thanks to mr van heerden .
thirdly , r67,3 million has been voted for the upgrading of buildings .
these amounts have been allocated as follows : health , r44,1 million , and the hospital reconstruction and rehabilitation programme , r23,2 million .
madam chairperson , the aspect of transport is broader than that .
madam chairperson , the third aspect is generation of own income .
the western cape chamber business and the cape metropolitan council opposed toll-roads .
the greatest challenge for this department is the aspect of transformation .
we refer to black and white when we speak about working classes .
madam chairperson , the hon minister spoke at length on roads .
we have to capture it , and address the problems internally .
] we have been given the assurance that that is going to happen .
we wish him well in his retirement to a retirement village .
] we are now saddled with the consequences of that weak administration .
i thank the hon minister for having listened to us .
you must get yourself a vehicle like garth ' s .
in fact , some have already started .
i am sure that the small business owners would appreciate the extra business .
we in the karoo and the little karoo are proud of him .
i want the hon minister to investigate that problem .
in another it was 5 microbuses with 15 seats .
he also referred to the metropolitan transport authority , the mta .
the hon member mr louis also referred to the toll-road legislation .
the hon member mr louis also referred to the buildings .
] the national department of public works is responsible for police stations .
so you do not want that money , the r10 million ?
sometimes we only see the people who are sitting here ...
] this is an unusual interactive moment in the house !
in our case it entails all three spheres of government .
our consumers enjoy their drink and want their tipple readily available .
madam chairperson , i now come to the policy on property management .
wesgro is the province 's sole provider of trade and investment promotion services .
in the magisterial district in which the proposed liquor licences would be located .
" maybe the policy " snaar " will have to pull more .
i want hon members to hear me speak my heart on this .
i say this as a proud western cape afrikaans african from south africa .
tony leon says that inclusivity stops at nature 's valley .
i would like , however , to concentrate on one policy , namely the planned liquor policy .
the western cape has a 28 % share of south africa 's tourist market .
meetings , conventions , conferences and exhibitions are potentially important markets for south africa .
but the anc wants to legalise all the shebeens for economic empowerment .
i would like the hon minister to address that particular issue .
i am not going to deal with liquor and liquor licenses .
we want to see the detail of the hon minister 's plan .
we do , of course , look forward to our engagements with the hon minister .
they tried it in germany and had to abandon it .
regarding the audit of rentals , it is actually finished .
] he can stir the pot , i definitely agree with that .
let me state quite clearly what i understand under empowerment .
] let us look at poverty relief money that has not been spent .
it is because they did not have the capacity , ...
you know it is because of 40 years of np rule .
the hon member should not lecture me about that .
] no. that is why i am going to tell him again .
would the hon member like to have seen what would have happened to illegalities ?
fighting against the anc incompetence in this country .
moreover the indications are that there are declining profit levels in several industries .
madam chairperson , these manifestations represent the complexity of our industry .
furthermore agriculture provides 70 % of the job opportunities in sub-saharan africa .
the price of agricultural diesel is also contributing to a lower profit margin .
" this is a summary of what the farmers have to do .
madam chairperson , i would like to say something about low returns .
the hon minister referred to this before , but was it implemented ?
the hon premier is busy with a regionalisation programme with other regions .
i wish to address an appeal to the hon minister of agriculture .
the history of south africa is fundamentally one of land deprivation .
" add-on " is the cape dialect for " byvoeging " .
in my constituency a very large farming enterprise was started with table grapes .
i do not think that the hon member ms essop truly appreciates ...
this concession is quite right , why should ships pay for roads ?
the sam purchased a ship in order to import barley .
this company had to dismiss 1 150 people because chickens are being imported .
the hon member mr mckenzie indicated to him to remain silent .
however , bokkie 's father only received a bicycle as compensation .
also add to that that this week at calitzdorp ...
under the heading " health " , the following appears , and i quote :
under the heading , " housing " , the following appears , and i quote :
fourteen days ago i addressed 110 new farmers at outeniqua .
in october 1999 the eastern cape had already overspent r80 million ...
madam chairperson , i want to appeal to hon members .
perhaps it is as well to conclude on this point .
it is not on the whole vote and the programmes .
i have noted the objection of the anc in vote 1 .
i have noted the objection of the anc in vote 2 .
i have noted the objection of the anc in vote 4 .
we now continue with voting from vote 5 on .
the house adjourned at 16 : 09 until tuesday , 18 april 2000 .
debates of the parliament of the province of the western cape ( hansard )
does the hon member give notice , or does she want to move it now ?
that is not acceptable to the hon member mr ramatlakane .
the house adjourned at 15 : 25 until tuesday , 23 may 2000 .
we will strive to satisfy this 5 % as well .
hon members are all aware of our 79 % matric pass rate .
i am also particularly proud to be a " wes-kapenaar " .
yes , i am exceptionally proud to be from the western cape .
training motor mechanic apprentices from the athlone college from march this year .
we do not need bad apples in the western cape basket .
in particular , there are two ugly issues that i would like to address .
if anyone is caught for drunken driving his driving licence must be taken from him .
they say that with threatening storms come the most beautiful rainbows .
i refer also to sam nujoma who wants to be president for life .
a precedent of accepting urgent legislation has thus been set .
mr speaker , at the outset i would like to put the record straight .
these have been 51 days without a word from the provincial government .
a dossier on these issues was presented to the hon minister .
no , no , the hon member should leave the voting out of it .
" he did not even know what he was doing .
therefore i am pleased that the amendment bill is coming before us today .
] yes , but he simply cannot tolerate the dp .
amelia and bianca , 17 and 18 years old respectively , were cruelly murdered .
gangs , drugs and crime are part of the history of the np .
in the meantime young girls are being harmed to such an extent as a part of being introduced into gangs .
hon members can now take cognisance of the fact that the anc ...
we are being held back on the cape flats by strong pro-firearm groups .
they must walk around with pistols , while gangs walk around with semi-automatic weapons .
they are assured of the best food that we can offer .
they murdered many comrades in camps in mozambique and angola .
in south africa they had the security forces also committing murder .
i listened very carefully to the hon member mr byneveldt .
i remember her as a lively , talkative , sweet and lovable child .
she was a grade 9 pupil at the ravensmead secondary school .
these horrible deeds are not happening in middle or upper class areas .
one continually hears the cries of mothers and children for protection .
he promised everyone he saw a tavern licence .
among other things , this must include the service benefits of the police .
i do not entirely agree with many of the clauses ...
we must allow the hon minister to state his case .
we now have 25 police stations that do not deliver a 24-hour service .
however , i want to mention three things at the top of the list .
] let us leave it at that and speak about other things .
i am informed about the marches and strikes that are to take place .
they already control most of the cpfs in this province .
i wrote to the hon member mr byneveldt as follows :
the house adjourned at 17 : 10 until tuesday , 23 may 2000 .
( iii ) portfolio committee amendments to competition amendment bill [ b10c-2000 ] .
( x ) national youth commission amendment bill [ b25-2000 ] .
( xiii ) portfolio committee amendments to tourism amendment bill [ b50a-99 ] .
the hon member mr silke has moved this motion without notice .
the hon member mr silke was a member of that committee .
the house adjourned at 15 : 32 until tuesday , 20 june 2000 .
annual report of the western cape provincial tender board ( 1998 / 99 )
] i will tell hon members why , mr speaker .
they were immoral in 1999 and they are immoral in 2000 .
they were shameless in 1999 and they are shameless in 2000 .
the auditor-general will be asked whether this is feasible or not .
all spheres of government and all organs of state within each sphere must - ...
] we also , therefore , all supported the necessity for registration .
that is not in dispute - let us put it to one side .
they relied on the constitutional court case ...
instead they want some form of shared executive committee .
mr speaker , it has a great deal to do with political expediency .
which is being held together by these undemocratic , unaccountable and untransparent bills .
it was the dp / new np coalition in the province ...
they were just as happy because the registration process could proceed .
we needed 66 000 officials out of the 72 000 .
it is also no use trying to go to the dp .
instead they went to the standing committee ...
the director-general went to the trouble of explaining every motion .
mr speaker , i do thank the hon member mr strachan !
mr speaker , i would like to add to that statement .
mr speaker , we must understand why this process was followed .
madam chairperson , i would like to ask a question on procedure .
madam chairperson , vote 1 is that of the premier .
if this is the response , we are not going to have questions .
they did not spend this money in terms of their own line functions .
madam chairperson , i would like to raise a point of procedure .
madam chairperson , i would like to address you on this point .
madam chairperson , i would like to repeat what i said .
we are now dealing with vote 1 of the premier .
it is not as if we are going back to the hon premier .
that will be the hon member ms essop 's final question .
madam chairperson , it is my second question on this vote .
madam chairperson , i want to put the hon member mr ramatlakane 's mind at ease .
i do not know where the r18 000 came from .
i would assume that that would be reimbursed in an adjustments appropriation .
we have not dealt with an adjustments appropriation for the 1999-2000 financial year .
i phoned mr fourie and asked him about the figures .
madam chairperson , it was critically important to register voters .
madam chairperson , could the hon member repeat the question please ?
madam chairperson , how did the hon minister come to r120 ?
are there any objections to vote 16 - sport and recreation ?
i am going to ask the hon minister not to respond .
is the hon member trying to be smart for want of a name ?
they got paid r1 000 for the work done .
it is not a matter of not knowing ...
the hon member has another question for the hon premier .
madam chairperson , i can see exactly where this is going .
the questions the hon member is asking now are unprecedented .
hon members can put their questions , the speaker will respond to them .
hon members can ask the questions , the speaker will respond to them .
i put the question to the hon minister of local government .
i therefore regard the questions which are being asked as being frivolous in the extreme .
i have said that we have before us the western cape finance bill .
] yes , where were cuts made , if there were cuts ?
madam chairperson , the reimbursement will definitely take place in this financial year .
madam chairperson , i did not quite hear the question .
madam chairperson , yes , i think i did apply my mind .
the hon member ms essop has already asked her three questions .
madam chairperson , i cannot answer the question fully .
i assume that this amount was approved after 1 april 1999 .
those were the amounts withdrawn from the various subprogrammes .
] we received r9 000 from works ; subprogramme 1 , staff administration .
madam chairperson , i am not aware of such an agreement .
madam chairperson , i think that that is a very hypothetical question .
clauses 1 and 2 agreed to ( anc dissenting ) .
we are now going to deal with the third reading of the western cape finance bill .
does the hon member ms essop wish to put a point of order ?
in these townships we find the conditions for our pathologies .
he must also , as a corollary , take responsibility for unemployment .
the western cape still does not have a provincial deputy of police .
in this regard i want to thank the hon member ms rossouw .
i salute the hon premier for this inspiring commitment .
as already mentioned , this meaningless violence has already reached our farming communities .
i shall wait until they are outlined and then react to them .
why is this not a priority for the da now ?
mr speaker , people also know that it was the anc-run ...
why are rdp houses being sold by da local authorities to the highest bidder ?
mr speaker , let me get to that point right now .
] it will take that hon member to where he belongs .
the anc was built on the principle of non-racialism and democracy .
the promotion of the western cape economy must happen within this context .
they should be making sure that people are signing up for the child support grants .
we have to have a multi-pronged approach in developing those communities .
or was it the anc that did not really want him ?
that hon member need not inform me .
mr speaker , it is said that silence is acquiescence .
there were pictures with full colour photographs in cape newspapers .
the facts are , then , that these people were sold for r200 .
] the hon member is welcome to do that .
and when mother-to-child transmission programmes were regarded in government circles as politically very incorrect ?
we all know what happened - that is old news .
those same spin doctors have caused him to land up in court !
no one will take the anc seriously when they designate candidates for mayor .
they must become more flexible where hiv / aids is concerned .
mr speaker , in general we support the western cape adjustments appropriation bill .
] there was a commitment to give it to poverty relief .
mr speaker , i move on to the question of the cameras .
i regard the grandwest casino as an investment for the province .
an amount of r400 was paid to approximately 5 200 people .
madam chairperson , i will give it consideration at the time .
does the hon member want the answer to be duplicated ?
points of order are to do with the procedure in the house .
however , points of order in this house refer only to procedure .
it is not a grant , as grants are clearly defined .
ongoing violence on cape flats between golden arrow and cata and codeta
it was agreed between the parties that golden arrow could operate normally .
on 16 may 2000 legislation was adopted by the provincial parliament .
no , not for a moment will any of us flinch from our responsibility .
mr speaker , i did not refer to any hon member .
mr speaker , i gladly take part in this very critical debate .
the acdp recommends the following solutions to the hon minister .
let us just consider our presentation on the metropolitan transport authority today .
the issue of subsidies for small and medium enterprises requires attention .
mr speaker , i reported the situation ...
the hon minister has a priority - what she has put in place .
] three days later the national minister of transport went overseas .
mr speaker , on a point of order : i object .
all the applications we received from islps were disposed of .
i say this every time in the meeting with the taxi association .
an hon member : you are confusing two things .
] i am not talking to him .
people who live in guguletu are people that i know ; ...
we should just set aside the time to implement it .
the taxi companies will have to publicly reject intimidation and violence .
the house adjourned at 16 : 02 until tuesday , 20 june 2000 .
mr speaker , i would like to move a motion without notice .
the third important decision deals with the award of a hotel concession .
this event alone brought in r300 million for the city of durban .
no other city in south africa even begins to feature .
the western cape has become a global player in a highly competitive market .
let us make this convention business centre work in the interests of the western cape .
mr speaker , the anc has raised the issue of empowerment .
that is not representative at all and it needs to be addressed .
the hon member was at none of those presentations .
clause 3 ( 1 ) defines all the objects of convenco .
if other public bodies actually do not comply with it ...
] there is national legislation which covers it in any case .
the convenco agreement is a very specific agreement with very specific parties .
subsection ( 1 ) applied then to both agreements .
it applied to both the shareholders ' agreement and the convenco agreement .
or purchasing equity in convenco in terms of the convenco agreement ...
therefore , subsection ( 2 ) would not have been required .
madam chairperson , i would like to address you on this issue .
would the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism like to address me ?
the committee wishes to express its dissatisfaction at the disregard for tender board directives .
suspension of mr a williams and another member from new np
therefore , the speaker follows the list that is placed in front of him .
the hon minister has unfortunately taken a narrow view on the legislation .
the department said to us , " no comment " .
our proposed paragraph ( f ) was , and i quote :
mr speaker , i am not going to say much about that .
i give the hon member mr mckenzie his due .
mr speaker , i withdraw the word " lieg " .
i want to give the reasons to hon members of the anc .
mr speaker , this year is an historic year for local government .
] no , i had spoken at length with the anc members of saron .
i want to give him the assurance that we are indeed acting within the constitution .
we are experiencing a crisis in the western cape as far as gang violence is concerned .
the judiciary has a duty to perform towards humanity .
i put the question - the hon member mr r williams .
i want to quote what peter hain said at that forum .
mr speaker , peter hain said , and i quote :
do we have the right people , those that stick to the law ?
this is a white male chauvinist who has given his judgment .
what contribution is the anc making towards the independence of the judiciary ?
no , those hon members are hiding behind words .
] mr speaker , i shall not elaborate on that further .
fight back against corruption , crime , cronyism and the sacp .
they are not obsessed with oppositional politics ; they want transformation .
those who remain outside of this consensus can go to the dp .
] those hon members cannot for their lives ...
i really think that this debate does not belong here .
mr speaker , as it pleases you , i withdraw them .
i heard what the hon member ms essop said .
we want the bodies to assist the small businessmen there .
mr speaker , i would like to conclude by summing up .
however , in return there are things to be given up .
i respond in his absence to motions that he has moved .
because the anc cronies appointed there stole the money .
nothing has happened , bugger-all , zilch , nothing !
go to california , which is probably one of the best areas .
" that is exactly the right way to do it .
the house adjourned at 15 : 06 until tuesday , 22 august 2000 .
( viii ) local government : cross-boundary municipalities bill [ b37b-2000 ] .
debates of the parliament of the province of the western cape ( hansard )
what did the people of pinelands contribute to the poor areas ?
madam speaker , the anc mistakes big government for effective government .
] do my colleagues in the anc not agree with that ?
] because they are not listening , madam speaker .
] madam speaker , in addition , and more seriously , ...
madam speaker , in short , there must be flexibility of valuation .
the hon member mr silke referred to a lower growth rate .
he should tell us what the growth rate was in 1992 .
i am sorry , the hon member 's time has expired .
hon members all know how it got onto the internet .
why does marthinus not agree with you on that point ?
no , do not give the cape argus the blame now .
ultimately we must ring-fence our water account and all the different service accounts .
an hon member : you took a long time to ask it .
what is the hon member mr dugmore 's point of order ?
madam speaker , yes , i had to speak much louder than normally .
i shall tell hon members what should have happened .
the western cape produces approximately 20 % of the total agricultural production value of south africa .
the murder of the marais couple was a loss to their family .
the house adjourned at 17 : 56 until thursday , 7 september 2000 .
" i think that is a serious reference to a chair .
hon members should please turn down the volume of the interpretation devices .
i now call upon the hon member mr ismail to speak .
the hon premier is perhaps right in what he said .
now , once again , this new np-controlled council is plagued with corruption .
what is their barometer saying about what is happening there ?
mr speaker , the anc did not initiate this .
mr speaker , i did however not leave it at that .
an hon member : is he a member of the new np ?
an hon member : is he a member of the new np ?
hon members must be very careful in making such allegations .
mr speaker , i have a copy of that letter as well .
replacement of minister of finance and development planning as director of convenco
members of the executive council of a province may not ...
we obviously have to fiddle around to fathom this all .
all the little hidden development planners and so on appear to be white .
mr speaker , let me make one point .
all those board members only now suddenly , because of our insistence , ...
it is only being done now - it was done last friday .
mr speaker , thank you very much for the opportunity to speak .
the act is elaborated on by the draft executive ethics code .
mr speaker , it shows how infectious bad habits can become !
mr speaker , as i said , it was unanimously accepted .
executive committee - thank god you recognise his name - ...
" but there was not one word from mr mowzer .
or expose themselves to any situation involving the risk ...
the house adjourned at 16 : 34 until tuesday , 19 september 2000 .
we hear the same roar , but the lion does not have any teeth .
these can only be described as cowardly , contemptible and inhuman acts .
this behaviour is totally indefensible .
it does not matter what those responsible for the bombs wish to convey .
mr speaker , next i want to discuss the ...
mr speaker , today our democracy is in the dock .
the chief justice of south africa who died recently was a muslim .
or , as alan paton put it , and i quote :
that afternoon they were here in our building at 15 : 00 .
] mr speaker , that is the reality in this province .
the hon minister is completely " missed " in any case .
mr speaker , let me refer again to the house .
this is because competence has become increasingly irrelevant to the anc .
it is precisely in this area where the anc government has failed .
it is for the anc to take that seriously .
i see two of them may have done so already .
how many black persons are in the first 12 in their benches ?
reconciliation with transformation - not the one without the other .
the advertisements are being placed this coming weekend , and i want to ...
a " motjie " is a respected person in certain ...

mr speaker , i shall wait until the motion is withdrawn .
- r0,5 million for the financial management of the social security system .
details of these are specified in the explanatory memorandum of the adjustments budget .
is that exaggerated , as hon members on that side always react ?
] it further destroys many possibilities where farmers are prepared ...
the da has a number of practical proposals , including :
] no , not to the farm shop , the r50 is rental .
if you had been my member here , i would have evicted you .
] a leopard does not change its spots .
in any event , surely there are many farmers of colour .
i will not excuse brutality at the hands of farmers or farm workers .
] does the anc not think that they should set an example ?
the next case i wish to single out is the kobus botha case .
the anc is constantly engaged in distorting the truth ...
" everything is fine with farm workers in the western cape .
over the past four years 900 farmers have been murdered in south africa .
( iii ) south african reserve bank amendment bill [ b62-2000 ] .
resolution 10 : grading of municipalities and remuneration and fringe benefits of officials
clause 5 of the nhls bill empowers the service to :
mr speaker , it was to save the taxpayer money .
in absolute numbers that is over 500 000 fewer votes .
and responsible decision in the interests of the iec process .
this has provided greater certainty in budgeting and medium-term fiscal planning .
the first is the shifting of funds from the national revenue fund .
a task team has been appointed to look into the matter .

mr speaker , i gladly follow the hon member ms mqulwana .
stealing from the poor , bringing in the drug lords and prostitutes , and creating havoc ?
what about the export processing centre and its partnership with the cape chamber of commerce ?
regrettably for us all , it is a loud " no !
however , mr speaker , the situation is much worse than that .
precedents abound around the world that when government ...
i will deal with the hon member at a much later stage .
] it only cares for the votes it receives .
mr speaker , we can quarantine this virus ...
allow me to give hon members some facts .
what did the da do after the analysis of 5 december ?
] he was the nnp 's councillor in the executive committee .
they can bring all the election results - i have seen them !
is he quite sure that president mbeki will be here tomorrow ?
sir , let me now begin with the hon member mr dugmore .
what is stated in the cape argus of tuesday , 30 january 2001 ?
mr chairperson , but these are still just good intentions .
the hon member mr silke continued along that path today .
they return again at 17 : 00 to clock out .
mr speaker , that is not a point of order .
i also made an analysis of the vredendal and clanwilliam situation .
i wonder where the hon member mr king was then .
he says we should think about nation-building and try to put it into practice .
he has yet to tell us what struggle he was in .
the hon member mr mckenzie went in and out of bonteheuwel .
i can give their spin doctor the assurance that it does not work .
] it does not matter ; the da is governing this province .
that is the national organisation , with weclogo being the western cape organisation .
mr speaker , i wish to refer briefly to the present councils .
the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs referred to this as well .
many hon members referred to my views on rural development .
the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works expanded on them .
president mbeki may talk about people being on different planets .
the hon leader of the opposition is right about one thing .

how does the hon minister know that harold cressy is predominantly muslim ?
that is what the hon minister said in her response .
all the senior officials are at war with the hon minister .
mr speaker , i can quote the example of seasonal time zones .
without a return to morality there will be no renaissance .
let us hear what the hon premier has to say on this day .
i thank the hon premier for now saying so at long last .
let me draw the attention of hon members to the following .
] mr speaker , i know i am their worst nightmare .
that is exactly what he did last year , you hypocrite !
i wish the cabinet would make this priority no 1 .
i am only asking for a more vigorous , virile and ferocious programme .
the education problem has been with us since the days of the tricameral system .
under the tricameral system , we had classes of 30 children for every teacher .
it is an opinion which the hon member mr isaacs is expressing .
the hon member will have to clear it with the chair first .
the commissioner for the environment will be appointed during the tenure of this government .
of course we know that poverty relief is the issue of the day .
of course we know that aids is a pandemic in the making .

the hon minister of finance and development planning said in his speech :
the second issue crops up in this vote and in vote 6 as well .
] is there a policy or is there no policy ?
madam chairperson , in this regard we in this province need ...
it is this kind of suggestion that we call empowerment to the people .
] the executive can do so if it wants to .
] he went on raving about this matter .
i just want to dismiss this as a laughable , cheap and politically ...
the damage that was caused has still not been properly calculated .
madam chairperson , what he has just said is very disappointing .
i fully agree with the hon minister on that point .
i think that the hon member mr strachan raised the point .
" i believe that that is the way nice people deal with matters .
madam chairperson , i would just like to explain what i said .
the mozambique disaster is just one of the commitments that we have to fulfil .
this effectually means that station management goes by the board in those times .
in other words , 2,48 officers per 1 000 units of the population .
how many of hon members can name one patrol officer in their residential area ?

unfortunately our townships are still struggling with the evil of firearms .
we cannot wait so long until we have a unicity .
" the next one says : " no , i am a traffic officer .
as far as this hon minister is concerned , the list is almost endless .
i should now like to discuss the community patrol officers ( cpos ) .
in steenberg there are only 2 as against the 13 cpos in milnerton .
i regard project chrysalis as a good project that deserves support .
women and children in particular are very much at the receiving end as far as crime is concerned .
the cape constabulary , however , has never come , but it has already gone .
it is of critical importance that our schools and medical service centres are made safe .
that negates much of what the hon member mr byneveldt said .
madam chairperson , from manenberg to muizenberg our police stations are simply not functioning .
such attitudes and negative approaches are strongly condemned by the new np .
mr chairperson , secondly i would like to talk about the aaa project .
there are 100 people per month , and 1 000 people per annum .
i am saying that the hon minister ought to put that on the agenda .
] that hon member said i sit on the board .
the hon member mr lewis referred to the stabilisation of communities .
that hon member should not shake his head ; it is true .
those hon members are leaders of communities ; they themselves have said so .
we have also successfully re-established the western cape sports academy over the last year .
indeed , we are in fact a nature of armchair sport lovers .
less than 10 % of our population participates in formal sport .
at this point i wish to thank my department for their tireless effort .
i want to pay tribute especially to dr kane-berman , who will be retiring shortly .
all the projects and programmes of the directorate revolve around the anti-crime campaign .
south africa has returned to international sport because of the anc government 's national policy .
the hon minister made a promise about the opening of regional offices .
mr chairperson , these are the issues the hon minister is silent about .
the last issue i want to single out is that of internal auditing .
we cannot raise children here while there are still imbalances .
however , before the 1995 election they were privatised and placed in white hands .
i think we are the only province to have brought about ...
] let us try to find a solution to the problem .
of that , 0,95 % goes to the staff and 22 % to me .
i believe we need more short-term feedback mechanisms than just the ballot-box .
the creation of a virtual reality university is also on the cards .
we are particularly interested in the youth and gender equity programmes of the assembly .
more specific and proactive programmes have to be developed to achieve this .
r5 million has been allocated for the start-up of this project .
i am keen to hear their constructive and proactive proposals .
what effect does this have on investor confidence and everything that goes with it ?
] i am not saying it ; they say it .

we shall also have to make ict-based resource material available on an unprecedented scale .
mr chairperson , our sixth priority is to develop schools-based management .
behaviour modification programmes will also be presented after school hours for pupils who are experiencing behavioural problems .
these centres will accommodate pupils with behavioural problems who require specialised assistance .
i am referring to ms cindy shaiy , circuit manager based in george .
i would like to ask the hon minister to look into this .
in the new south africa we cannot afford a repetition of that .
in global terms , south africa is severely underrepresented in science , engineering and technology .
many schools are barely able to make ends meet .
that indicates that the department is led by a progressive director-general .
i can understand why the hon minister is slow to commit herself .
manenberg senior secondary school has a proud history in the educational arena .
some pupils will in future still be accommodated at these centres .
any forensic auditor to whom we say that , would simply laugh at us .
it is conceivably the most serious crisis we are facing in any curriculum area .
let me deal with the problem of khanyolwethu high school and mr qaba .
madam chairperson , i will try to be as short as possible .
- " e " stands for " efficient and effective management " ;
this will equip me and the head of department to monitor performance effectively .
this financial year will lay the foundation for dramatic growth in the 2001-02 financial year .
we shall also attempt to generate work for the smaller businessman .
out of this allocation , upgrading and reconstruction activities are planned at about 70 health facilities .
there is a correlation between tb infection rates and those for hiv / aids .
madam chairperson , i now want to speak about another health concern .
the western cape unfortunately has one of the highest incidences of tb in the world .
community education campaigns need to be reinforced through community health centres on a continual basis , as appropriate .
the strength of the health system is reflected in the health status of children .
one of the key functions of academic hospitals is the training of doctors .
the situation is further bedevilled by the complicated structure of our health care services .
madam chairperson , i want to take this opportunity to say ...
however , he was not sent to tygerberg before the following afternoon .
why should they be the first level of entry if they are so understaffed ?
there should be incentive bonuses and not penalties for good governance .
this hon minister has a budget of r3,3 billion in the 2000-01 financial year .
but the hon leader of the opposition was nowhere to be seen .
] well , i have dealt with the hon leader of the opposition .
the hon member also mentioned the shortage of nurses .
we can probably never spend enough money on hiv / aids .
i will look at other matters that the hon member raised .
i also thank the hon member mr silke for his contribution this afternoon .
the budget for the 1999-2000 financial year amounted to r2,2 billion .
this function will be carried out by the staff in programme 5 : customer services .
i hope that is not a threat to hon members present !
this assistance consists of clothes , foodstuffs , blankets , mattresses , cooking equipment and other eating facilities .
in the current financial year 23 municipalities applied to the department .
an amount of r3,4 million was paid to disaster victims in respect of that event .
we must look at creating a safety net for those communities .
we want to process all new applications for social grants within 35 days .
there is still a backlog of more than 400 in the bellville office .
it reads as follows , " poor management by the state causes the poorest to suffer " .
] i think that some people should hang their heads in shame .
mr chairperson , during the elections maintenance grants was a very hot issue .
mr chairperson , the national department of welfare has allocated r2 million .
mr chairperson , this department has many pressures of society to handle .
coloured women were asked to jump out of an aircraft without a parachute .
we need to kick-start small business among the previously disadvantaged communities .
this is a considerable amount - something like r42 million or more .
i agree with his concern that we can no longer waste time .
madam chairperson , over the past year a considerable number of projects have performed well .
the marketing and housing process is currently progressing at a rate of more or less 20 families per day .
the utilisation of these funds could ensure that the housing process keeps its momentum .
mr chairperson , how do we begin to face this challenge ?
instead , he waits for proposals and does things in a piecemeal way .
i want to challenge the pride of that hon minister .
what does he want the western cape to look like in the near future ?
violence is escalating in those areas because there was no proper integration system .
( h ) realising the right of access to -
] madam chairperson , if change does not come about ...
madam chairperson , i note a lack of gender representivity in this debate .
for his information , i am the " instigator " of that legislation .
madam chairperson , the hon member mr lewis also referred to it .
cape town submitted an application for the first time on 5 october 1999 .
that hon member should therefore not come here and make wild allegations .
the hon member mr stali spoke about towncon and smartie town .
the hon member mr dugmore must please not be so inquisitive .
madam chairperson , today i am submitting a budget of r13,7 million .
all district municipalities , including those within the cape metropolitan area , have their own disaster management coordinating structures .
we are sitting with legislation from 1977 and also some fire-fighting legislation from 1987 .
the next shortcoming that i want to mention is the issue of contingency plans .
i want to thank those hon members who played a role in this most sincerely .
specifically in the western cape , we see this as an opportunity for innovation .
the composition of the forums is 50 % anc members and 50 % new np members .
i believe that we are going to use section 197 of the labour relations act .
one of the successes that we have already achieved is in clanwilliam .
there are already municipalities whose asset registers are not up to date .
of course , one cannot simply place a blanket moratorium on appointments .
madam chairperson , we are not just going to stop on 1 november .
they want to dissolve the eight provincial bodies and incorporate them into one body .
i also want to thank weclogo for the role that they play .
i tried to find out how much progress they have made with the valuations .
we can talk about the other new np councils in the metropole .
the hon minister said that we should not spend money unnecessarily .
the hon minister should be quiet when no one is talking to him .
from november onwards we will have a new system of municipal government .
the first key element is the completion of the voter registration process within this province .
it is intended to complement housing programmes and services to poor households .
the same goes for housing , which is a concurrent function with national government .
it is the dp , however , that prevents that kind of cooperation happening .
the hon member mr mckenzie also referred to the 1997 financial statements .
there were problems , and i can give hon members the answer .
i must add immediately that the auditor-general granted them an extension .
they are having a tough time , but hon members can go and look at the development .
i would like to tell hon members the reason for this .
this house has the responsibility to give them answers to those questions .
i want to thank the hon member mr r williams for his contribution .
let me go on to thank the hon member mr marais for his contribution .
no doubt we will now see more community organisations coming forward .
national house of traditional leaders amendment bill [ b 15-2000 ] .
likewise , nominations were invited for the panel of the planning review board .
i want to thank him for the way in which he manages the finance portfolio .
i want to point to some of those , firstly the issue of the coastal policy .
] in september last year he said , and i quote :
mr chairperson , the third issue that has been delayed is the urbanisation policy .
thirdly , there is the important sustainable balance between development and environment .
however , i intend to go further than the hon minister did .
i also want to address the hon minister 's key measurable objectives .
one of the requirements is that one must have a legal background .
] in order to achieve that , we must forget about the differences .
i would like to thank the hon member mr ismail for his ...
it was councillor dicky meter , who is a member of the anc .
hon members should please allow the hon minister to continue .
the hon member also referred to " environment , environment , environment " .
the existing planning exercises are ecological in nature and site specific .
madam chairperson , i move on to the hon member mr louis .
we do not call for specific people to be on the review board .
i have already mentioned that we go out of our way to assist them .
the value of those projects amounted to r3,75 billion .
two new libraries will be built this year at parkwood and in wellington .
there will also be three travelling exhibitions , excluding the anglo-boer war exhibition .
madam chairperson , in 1991 the then president 's council developed an environmental management policy .
in particular we also considered the aspect of non-formal environmental education .
it is only r860 000 , but at least it is a start .
when we get to fisheries , that hon member can raise that point .
they should not force me to rule in terms of rule 41 .
in the age group 15 years to 19 years 21 % were hiv-positive .
we need an approach that deals with the problems now .
most worrying of all is the deterioration of freshwater lakes , rivers and marshes .
healthy marine life can only survive when there are clean and healthy rivers .
- to meet the needs of the ff at that time -
in this department , the hon minister funds a number of very interesting projects .
] it is not my task to try and wake them up .
as regards the ukuvuka project , i did not attend the last meeting .
there was a motion earlier today by the hon member mr winde .
we have to do something about macassar ; it has become an absolute disgrace .
] we need to acknowledge that support from the national government .
i would really again encourage hon members to make short interjections .
the national department responded by saying , and i quote :
there are no personnel and financial implications for the department .
mr speaker , i understand that the standing committee is going to move certain amendments .
the transformation process continues to impact significantly on the department of transport .
the 2000-01 allocation for the department of transport is r428,169 million .
the first phase of this process is to be completed by early 2001 .
the next point i wish to single out is the privatisation of weighbridges .
the process to recapitalise the industry is currently in progress .
the registration of metered taxis and their drivers is to start this year .
madam chairperson , the next point i want to highlight is traffic safety plans .
the value of this portfolio is in the order of r14 billion .
the hon minister of finance and development planning has left the house now .
the critical aspect about this is that it is a very important vehicle .
every development is in the region of r100 million or r200 million .
i believe that an integrated and inclusive approach has not been followed .
mr chairperson , works remains very close to my heart .
we are concerned about parking facilities for provincial buildings in the cbd .
mr chairperson , i would like to address the aspect of maintenance .
i also wish both departments a very special 2000 and 2001 .
he visited me recently to assist at rooiberg .
if they read schedule 4 of the constitution , they will see that .
madam chairperson , i am speaking about a constitutional mandate that is being disregarded .
bangladesh , india , kenya , pakistan , ghana , botswana and south africa have demonstrated this fact .
if we continue in that way we are going to have the wrong output .
i want to refer at once to the budget allocation that we have received this year .
if he does not listen to that , they send him a summons .
madam chairperson , the letter was sent to madiba 's office .
why is it evident from the documentation that the reality is different ?
the department must put mechanisms in place to monitor such partnerships .
over the past three years the little karoo has experienced three major floods .
the new np will honour its responsibility and thank those people .
i wish the hon minister of transport and works everything of the best .
i , however , would like to congratulate the hon minister of transport and works .
firstly , i would like to express to the hon minister my disappointment .
madam chairperson , the hon member mr mckenzie should come to order .
we want to see to it that those 7 million m  are optimally used .
] then we would have heard that ministers are living in luxury .
mr j van heerden did not receive the full amount of money allocated .
and this is for the sake of the hon member ms essop as well .
( b ) the total value of the tenders amounts to r30 million .
only 20 companies have defaulted .
no school has been built in the previously advantaged community since 1994 .
i have said that we will be advertising 12 bus contracts next month .
every road , wherever it is built , is an important connecting route .
the hon member mr fransman also referred to jeffares & green .
] let us leave jeffares & green and the consultants alone now .
the matter is being dealt with by the george - is it bridgetown or bridgton ?
] i am giving hon members the name of the inspector .
mr jakkie van heerden and i will go and inspect that school .
does the hon member mr king wish to address the chair on the same point ?
i wish to add to what the hon member mr marais had to say .
the first company , which recently located here , is senior flexonics sa .
we hope to publish it in mid-may 2000 .
the demand side requires a comprehensive understanding of tourism markets , tourists and their needs .
] in fact , i speak of most hon members of the house !
the management of public property in south africa is in the process of change .
another question is whether the relevant consumer department is utilising its buildings to the optimum extent .
this has resulted in the development of the look out hill project .
we will include aids awareness through our sector programmes and also through the liquor policy .
the awareness of this situation in our industry is critically important .
we have budgeted r782 000 for this service during the next financial year .
yes , we have done a lot and i have to tell hon members about it .
madam chairperson , i heard somebody say , " it is boring .
it will also provide us with valuable experience in the ppp field .
a similar process is now under way at tygerberg hospital .
i am not going to spend time talking about the knowledge economy .
i am going to cut a lot out of my speech , purely for the sake of time .
] i am going to respect the timing of most of my members .
i want mr slabbert to comment on this later for me .
i think it is a lot of money not wisely spent .
i should also like to thank mr du preez , ms platzky and mr slabbert .
the hon minister also asked what the client out there is looking for .
madam chairperson , the growth potential of tourism in south africa is widely recognised .
that , i believe , is a key challenge to this particular hon minister as well .
the hon minister - excuse me , the future minister - strachan ...
at least transparency allows criticism and that is what we invite .
regarding infrastructure , the hon member mentioned important aspects on transport .
it will be unpacked and we will have some training in this regard .
i would like to address the point by the hon member ms essop directly .
the hon member mr strachan dealt with tony leon 's inclusivity .
that is why most of what this administration is doing is about empowerment .
madam chairperson , i am delighted that you want to hear me !
the hon member should go and look very carefully at that piece of legislation .
] madam chairperson , i still blush when i run the gauntlet .
he expressed ostensible doubt about our preparedness to implement it .
] they are dismantling the legacy of nelson mandela brick by brick .
the " fight back " campaign was not a racist campaign .
under severe constraints the chief directorate : agriculture has managed to maintain a minimum service level .
nevertheless , agriculture is entering the coming financial year with at least 150 unfunded posts .
how good is the current profit situation in the agricultural sector of the western cape ?
in this way some aspects of the farm problem can be circumvented .
in south africa we pay approximately 40 % of the wholesale price in tax .
this is only true in cases where a competitive labour-intensive means of production exists .
following the outbreak , our vets inoculated 588 horses against the disease .
during this period only 785 of the 63 455 claims have been disposed of .
let us cooperate to ensure that land reform in south africa takes place in an orderly fashion .
every year our government collects r5 billion in tax from this industry .
in addition , western cape agricultural land has been ravaged by fires , extreme heat and hail .
madam chairperson , i gladly follow the hon minister of agriculture .
madam chairperson , i would like to make reference to two issues in my speech .
it is definitely wrong that provincial and national research and development activities are declining .
it is a pity that there has been a 5 % drop in technology .
capital fixity is a problem inherent in the nature of agricultural production .
at present approximately 30 people who were previously unemployed are employed by the project .
when the esta was put in place , that project was summarily terminated .
at the end of the day the minimum wages can become a maximum wage .
moreover , they do not even want to hear about a rebate on diesel .
let us look at the situation in the southern cape .
they mixed the malt without permission , therefore doing it illegally , with the feed .
at present the wine industry is 60 % white wine and 40 % red wine .
madam chairperson , i wish to appeal to the hon minister .
the hon minister referred to what has happened to our chicken industry at present .
we know for a fact that the rate of unemployment is the highest at the moment .
the hon member ms phike is right , problems are encountered .
the book debt is recovered directly from her and janneman 's salaries .
i said that things are not going well with land reform in south africa .
i really do not understand that story about coming two minutes late .
madam chairperson , the anc would like to motivate their objection as follows .
we believe that the hon minister has submitted none of her business plans .
madam chairperson , this is not an objection , but a query .
we will only take declarations of vote , containing any objections to that vote .
madam chairperson , this is a declaration of vote in regard to an objection .
madam chairperson , may i address you on a point of order ?
i believe we need more short-term feedback mechanisms than just the ballot-box .
the creation of a virtual reality university is also on the cards .
we are particularly interested in the youth and gender equity programmes of the assembly .
more specific and proactive programmes have to be developed to achieve this .
r5 million has been allocated for the start-up of this project .
i am keen to hear their constructive and proactive proposals .
what effect does this have on investor confidence and everything that goes with it ?
there are those obsessed with centralising power .
i refer here specifically to that shining example of dictatorship , robert mu-gabe .
our future is intertwined with that of the african continent .
i will discuss this matter with president mbeki at the earliest opportunity .
instead of mere uhuru elections , let us build an uhuru society and economy .
is the hon member dr van zyl moving the motion without notice ?
the solutions include permits and the local road transportation board operation .
administratively , the department should revisit the slp programme under the be legal campaign .
people have to travel long distances - the sick , old , disabled and children .
] they do not focus on the solution of the fundamental crisis .
by the dp 's process of writing the provincial constitution ...
the hon minister has an obligation towards the commuters in the townships .
we all know that the regulations are the property of the hon minister .
during this period people 's property has been damaged , and i am sorry about that .
there are 400 approved permits before the council ; we can discuss that .
i call upon hon members to support me outside as well .
this is going through the cape flats : amelia and bianca were cruelly murdered .
the hon minister of education is desperate for the cameras .
] did that hon member not speak enough before me ?
mr speaker , i gladly follow the hon member mr marais .
he really has a sonorous way of speaking and has a fine command of afrikaans .
he also briefly discussed firearm control , to which we can return later .
these will of course shortly be available in johannesburg at r50 per ak-47 .
" the gangs in fact control most of the prisons in which they are being held .
yes , before 1994 there was respect , because we hanged the people .
the allocation of resources to combat crime is also totally unequal .
things are now getting too hot for criminals in the cape metropole .
] carlos marigelo was a revolutionary in south america in the che guevara-era .
i have the full list of names of people who were arrested .
in south africa a single detective is responsible for 60 to 80 dossiers .
it is absolutely inhuman to carry on with such a situation .
on 29 may 2000 i am moving the training of cpos to oudtshoorn .
with all due respect , the hon member mr fransman has had his turn to speak .
i have decided to train neighbourhood watches myself , through my department .
i am also very concerned about the further role of the sandf .
ad hoc select committee on alleged deliberate misleading of the house and scof
he will do so again for the benefit of the entire house today .
] they were unethical in 1999 and they are unethical in 2000 .
mr speaker , these are the signs of a desperate political party .
or they do not understand what the word " voluntary " means .
we also made it with the knowledge , latterly , of the rev sampson .
hon members should now put questions or raise objections , if any .
madam chairperson , i would like to address the chair on this matter .
in the committee stage members are allowed to ask ministers questions .
members are allowed to put three questions per vote to ministers .
madam chairperson , i have asked only one question on vote 1 .
vote 1 in schedule 1 agreed to ( anc dissenting ) .
vote 5 in schedule 1 agreed to ( anc dissenting ) .
madam chairperson , i really do not know the figure .
vote 7 in schedule 1 agreed to ( anc dissenting ) .
what percentage of the money did go to the top administration and workers ?
vote 9 in schedule 1 agreed to ( anc dissenting ) .
i want to know under which programme or subprogramme this money was saved .
furthermore , could this money not have been used appropriately for poverty alleviation ?
this is only r18 000 in a budget of r2 billion .
vote 10 in schedule 1 agreed to ( anc dissenting ) .
i would like the hon member mr ismail to sit down .
madam chairperson , no , i have not received the information .

they toyi-toyi outside for something that is already happening ...
vote 12 in schedule 1 agreed to ( anc dissenting ) .
vote 13 in schedule 1 agreed to ( anc dissenting ) .
i am responding to the question , madam chairperson .
this is - let me remind the house - the current financial year .
i told hon members who the four of them are .
5 , 6 and 7 march , to a maximum of r1 000 .
if the hon member is not clear , i am sorry about it .
vote 1 in schedule 2 agreed to ( anc dissenting ) .
vote 2 in schedule 2 agreed to ( anc dissenting ) .
at the time i applied my mind and i discussed the matter with my planning officials .
the hon minister is not in contempt of the house .
i am now going to put vote 4 - planning , local government and housing .
vote 4 in schedule 2 agreed to ( anc dissenting ) .
we are sitting here in a chamber where the air-conditioning does not work .
vote 5 in schedule 2 agreed to ( anc dissenting ) .
vote 6 in schedule 2 agreed to ( anc dissenting ) .
the hon member ms essop will see what the result of that was .
madam chairperson , this schedule for authorisation was requested in december 1999 .
vote 11 in schedule 2 agreed to ( anc dissenting ) .
vote 12 in schedule 2 agreed to ( anc dissenting ) .
vote 14 in schedule 2 agreed to ( anc dissenting ) .
this committee stage did not go as quickly as last time !
mr speaker , we request that the third reading be put tomorrow .
as a senior member , the hon member can do a little better .
he cannot be " fair weather " about these things .
it was amilcar cabral who warned , " tell no lies , claim no easy victories .
yesterday he praised the hon minister of transport , sport and recreation .
mr speaker , thank you for the opportunity that has been afforded me .
all the necessary elements of this management plan have already been placed on record in detail .
many south africans have become disheartened as a result of the many unfulfilled promises .
and then we speak about , and i quote the hon premier :
experience shows that the crime rate is simply rocketing .
in this regard the allocation of resources is of course relevant .
the time for big talk , photos and shaking hands is past .
if that is what the hon premier means , then he must say that .
hon members are aware that many of these operations have been intelligence-driven operations .
we should not abuse words such as " adapt or die " .
there is a shortage of 230 000 units in the metropole alone .
mr speaker , i would also like to refer to the rental act .
he behaves as if he owns crossroads and all its people .
] in fact , those hon members are pushing for apartheid schools in other areas .
the hon premier delivered one of his most uninspiring speeches of all time .
on 9 february 2001 , the president will provide the programme of government .
this is a requirement of the constitution of the republic of south africa .
we all know that mr peter marais has been sent to the unicity .
this is unfortunately not the priority of the da provincial government .
just last week , the george narcotics bureau made some significant arrests .
i must ask once again : do the anc councillors understand the meaning of democracy ?
it is not part of our christian , muslim or other faith .
the hon premier has been running this province for six years already .
] prior to those six years they had been doing it for 48 years .
a clean community does just that - it cleans up the community .
liberate them from only being able to gain control of one district municipality ?
] on election day this was said in areas in my service area .
now they are all incited and they all take their things and ...
] i know , so do not try to correct me .
] mr noludwe was still the chairperson of the rdp at the time .
mr speaker , i wanted to put this issue into its correct perspective .
sir , it does not matter how the anc wishes to manipulate figures .
i want to tell him that i will not stop the evictions .
when they arrived there , they were dumped in an empty disused horse stable .
his arguments are wrong and obsolete , and i will check his hansard on that .
but , mr speaker , there is another thorn in my flesh .
there are 23 million people infected with hiv in sub-saharan africa .
one department specifically asked us to mention them .
we no longer talk about " interdepartmental , intersectoral and multidisciplinary " .
your hand is in your pocket instead of being on the ...
would the hon member mr ozinsky mind repeating the question ?
i am giving the hon member an example .
we shall have a presentation next week to consider the priority areas .
if various ministers say different things , hon members may ask questions on that .
funding is given to three basic components , the first being ngos .
( 1 ) the lack of interest in youth issues in the province ;
( 2 ) the fact that there is no youth policy ; ...
i therefore ask the hon member mr isaacs for a clear answer .
sir , i wish to compliment our leader on the laying of wreaths at vanrhynsdorp yesterday .
the hon member mr ozinsky can add any name to the list .
however , the acdp does not believe that this is a racial issue .
we warned a year ago that this set of issues required attention .
this is the contract system that i say should be fast-tracked .
mr speaker , i would like to ask why this is so .
i am delighted to say that some of that has already been carried out .
since 1995 they have sent only 112 new police recruits to this province .
mr speaker , i would like to mention soshanguve as an example .
and then he thinks aloud every time he changes his mind !
he singled out certain points from hansard and i shall reply to him on that .
we cannot draw a comparison with soshanguve or kwazulu-natal ...
i shall consult the record and if necessary i shall take action ...
mr speaker , you need not consult the record .
if people did not qualify in terms of government criteria , they lost .
we never asked for taxi operators to be on the board .
the hon member dr van zyl has moved this motion without notice .
if necessary , the chair will have to restrict hon members in this regard .
this was the result of a long , many-faceted and , indeed , fully-fledged process of selection .
it just shows us where we are in the global market .
in the standing committee we raised certain problems in the shareholders ' agreement .
it would stimulate the economy further and also make foreign investors more positive .
this was a new concept - could we obtain guidance ?
instead it talks about the 10-point system , which is long gone .
the anc will be moving an amendment to the bill in this regard .
once again they will use the approach of promoting their constituencies .
according to their agreement it is " and / or the province " .
suddenly in the new agreement there is a long grading system of shares .
we had an empowerment expert on the evaluation teams for our technical committees .
people went through a whole selection process and they had different strengths .
the second point is that sunwest is not going to make a contribution .
would the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism like to address me on this ?
and these are the critical words for the purposes of this amendment -
we would like to know if this was done in the correct way procedurally .
we argued that clause 5 ( 2 ) became redundant .
firstly , my interpretation of the committee proceedings is that it is correct .
clause 5 ( 1 ) of the original bill reads as follows :
i would also like to put the original clause 5 to the house .
i now refer to the amendment to clause 5 ( 2 ) .
( iii ) meat safety bill [ b29-2000 ] .
irregularities requiring further investigation : evidence supplied by the heath special investigation unit
( 5 ) the consultation process with these schools regarding transformation is questionable ;
the speaker operates in accordance with the list of speakers placed on the table .
mr speaker , i am ready to address the house .
] the new np is going into the election as a defeated foe .
helen is the hell in because they have now taken her away there .
our proposal under paragraph ( e ) was , and i quote :
the hon minister has had his chance to say his say .
] they must not break it down because their days are numbered .
] you see , they just do not know what they have .
] yes , they say a good statesman thinks 20 years ahead .
he can lie to them as he likes , and they will believe him .
one type of category a municipality has a collective executive system with a subcouncil .
section 151 ( 2 ) of the national constitution reads as follows :
since then , the legislative framework has been put in place by certain enactments .
no , that hon member should not speak about hernus kriel now .
i want to thank the hon member mr r williams for his contribution .
mr speaker , i shall permit him to deliver his speech .
mr speaker , i thank the hon minister of health .
the anc is doing everything it can to support that independence .
in terms of this report south africa has fared worse after two years .
the udm accepts the judgment in the allan boesak case .
the fact remains that at the central level the anc is in power .
] surely they have the power , so why do they not do it ?
the hon premier also knows , and that is why i am talking about this .
all of them , the hon premier included , come from the townships .
] good for them ! they are bringing some democracy as they did here .
] he does not apologise for it ; he is proud of it .
that is the simple basic statement of the cape times editorial .
] the two nations debate is applicable to this province .
mr speaker , there are certain aspects that i wish to concentrate on .
] we know what gave rise to that and the circumstances involved .
i should prefer to state the standpoint of the new np very clearly today .
mr speaker , i could not make out what the question was .
because the banks have acted as gatekeepers to the khula funding .
about 75 % of working south africans are in this sector .
therefore there is a total misconception about the small , medium and micro businesses .
we do not want them to be citizens of other african countries .
the flexible labour market in the uk is seen as the primary factor .
mr speaker , the anc looked at some of the complaints .
the hon member ms essop has already spoken about the following issue .
it is the same distinction as with the judiciary - interference and criticism .
it is a legal step , but it is not a concrete government solution .
the national small business council was set up to promote business associations for black businesses .
( a ) the motions on the order paper are in fact debated by the house ;
and that a final report had been compiled by the internal investigation unit ...
however , i first have to listen to the contents of the motion ...
if the hon member had been listening properly , he would have heard .
there is a very real danger of property rights being eroded in south africa .
madam speaker , there is a difference between regulation and total control .
madam speaker , we are now saying that these services must be further expanded .
how can it be a secret if it is on the internet ?
hon members all know what happened in the cape municipal area .
destabilisation of agriculture would certainly have catastrophic consequences for our economy .
madam speaker , agriculture in the western cape is of cardinal importance .
this goes not only for the farm workers but also the other employees .
the security forces must obviously sharpen up - they must do a lot better .
i really want to react to the request by the hon member mr williams .
madam speaker , murder per se is a symptom of something else .
not a single sound was heard about that from the hon minister .
madam speaker , thank you very much for the opportunity to reply .
( 2 ) expresses its deepest concern about the effects of foetal alcohol syndrome ;
] sometimes even the peanut gallery must shut up .
perhaps the hon minister had not wanted to attack members in the house .
i am pleased that the matter has gone through the standing committee stage .
it has all been said , and i therefore move the second reading .
i thank the hon member mr dugmore for raising it .
residents are waiting for a response from the da on what is going to happen .
the other issue i want to cite refers to erf 17040 .
the hon member mr ozinsky alluded to the commission of inquiry .
and in that municipality they have disassociated themselves from the new np members .
the hon minister represents the provincial government on the board of convenco .
he would definitely have objected , but it was , without discussion , ...
it is acceptable , because he said , " that is a lie !
is this the reason why no declarations were made at convenco ?
mr speaker , the hon premier and i were in pretoria yesterday .
] they go for the man and not the ball .
mr speaker , one does not need to make any disclosure whatsoever .
the hon member ms essop referred to " hennie " ...
] mr mowzer is not the only anc representative on that board .
mr speaker , did somebody call me a racist ?
no , the hon member was not referring to the hon minister .
you would not understand accountability even if we spelt it .
( vi ) local government : municipal structures amendment bill [ b51-2000 ] .
appointed : k mqulwana , c stali , m vantura discharged : y gabru , r williams
it appears as though somewhere along the road things have often broken down .
people knew that the hon premier was going to appear there that evening .
remarks of that kind can only result in the community eventually becoming divided .
the hon minister of community safety promised many things out there .
from the side of the prosecutor are cries such as " apartheid is dead !
it is a history of injustice , of suffering and of begging .
sir , 1994 came , and we established the free , nonracial , democratic south africa .
the anc are the architects of transformation , of where we are today .
then he / she does not qualify for affirmative action .
increasingly the principle of non-racialism is being sacrificed on the altar of power politics .
south africa has one of the highest levels of inequality in the world .
this is not a break from the legacy of nelson mandela .
] ... fairness , equality and the vision of a unified new south africa .
( 2 ) strongly condemns all crimes of this nature ; and
- the appropriation of funds that have become available to the province ;
we are disappointed in the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works .
if the hon minister creates that impression , what do all the farm workers say ?
we are waiting to hear what he has to say about this matter .
his weekly income is r120 and that of his wife is r60 .
overtime payment , although required by law , is not always implemented .
] i am beginning to doubt how many good farmers there in fact are in ...
but what about all the action being taken on farms , marius ?
] i am not saying that incidents such as these do not occur .
the next case to which i want to refer is that of willem odendaal .
they distribute pamphlets in which i am quoted as saying ...
the hon member mr mckenzie should also listen to what i am saying .
annual report of the western cape gambling and racing board 1999 - 2000 .
( ix ) local government : municipal structures amendment bill [ b51d-2000 ] .
the latter amount has already been expended in terms of the prescriptions applicable in this regard .
mr speaker , the hon minister of social services and poverty relief ...
is the hon member mr strachan prepared to take a question ?
mr speaker , i want to continue and repeat what i have said .
bill read a third time ( anc dissenting ) .
in summary , today i am asking that an additional r505 million be voted .
] people in guguletu have to stand in long queues at their hospital .
the hon premier said that this province is the best province .
that is just on r1 billion in one year from the united kingdom .
mr speaker , gambling is false gold - it robs the poor .
the hon premier and numerous other speakers denigrate the national government .
mr speaker , there is a decay happening within the anc .
this is precisely the critical change in the political landscape of south africa .
real delivery should be our prime motivation in this province as opposed to racial solidarity .
] that hon member wants me to read the results .
hon members should be careful how the hon minister leads them .
mr speaker , would the hon member mr mckenzie take a question ?
mr speaker , it is a pleasure for me to follow the hon member mr mckenzie .
then we found out that that man was one patrick mckenzie of bonteheuwel .
] the voters know that we are dealing here with an ...
the point of an interjection is to make it once .
i will give the hon member mr dugmore the full judgment .
i have been fighting that system since my first day in this position .
before he got the plattekloof constituency , after all , he had the bonteheuwel constituency .
councillors who underperform will have to give way to councillors who pull their weight .
mr chairperson , i want to thank the hon premier for his opening address .
let us rather use our common purpose as the catalyst for racial unity .
mr speaker , the people have spoken and we have our mandates .
mr speaker , i want to talk about the attacks on the n2 .
i also want to challenge the house to do something about manenberg .
i accept the explanation of the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism .
the hon member must remember that the anc managed that department .
drug smuggling and the evils that go with it are the highest in years .
an hon member : is his birthday belated or are your wishes belated ?
they , and so many other sports people all came through our school sport system .
contrary to what he believes , it did pay off for the anc .
that the da got control of some of these hung councils .
i would also like to thank that side of the house for their congratulations .
we will see how that will operate when it comes to the unicity .
no , i am not wasting time ; the hon minister is wasting valuable time .
we never see nnp people there - they are never there .
people in the townships do not even know who the councillors are .
probably few of them have reached the age of 60 .
the hon minister of housing has set an excellent example of service delivery .
mr speaker , i want to again talk about racism and sectarianism .
we want to make sure that everyone understands the morality of the dp .
racism in south africa is the direct result of the policy of apartheid .
when it is summer in those countries it is winter in south africa .
the eyes of the western cape are fixed firmly on the hon premier .
" hon members have probably heard of comm neil van heerden .
as far as the care of the aged is concerned , i would like to highlight the following .
the dp , the government in the province does the very same thing ...
mr uys can teach you how to pronounce my name .
was it his idea that the media should focus only on manenberg ?
i have to uphold mr williams 's point of order .
my dear friends in the new np have lost it !
i call on all members to abide by that rule .
they are asking the anc how they will address the issues .
it is out of order for the hon member mr gelderblom to put a question .
the former minister of social services and poverty relief will also say that .
now the anc comes and says that it wants executive mayors .
i want to tell hon members what they are saying to president mbeki .
they call themselves " senior officials of the former ikapa municipality " .
what does he think of the integrity of the iec chairperson in the western cape ?
i cannot uphold the hon member 's point of order .
let me go on to congratulate the hon premier on his initiative .
channelled intelligently , these are the ingredients of successful policing .
we still do not know how many staff members have been deployed and where to .
as a christian believer , i respect all other faiths represented in this provincial parliament .
we gave them the opportunity to demonstrate during the opening ceremony .
mr speaker , this is the beginning of a new year .
i said , " sir , is there something wrong with my money ?
i brought it to his attention and i feel fine now .
" the hon member and the rest of the anc are applying that maxim diligently .
yes , i saw you watching the bold and the beautiful .
] the hon premier has spoken of a pass rate of 92 % .
the hon minister and the hon premier are claiming easy victories .
the teachers have sought to obtain the equipment for the schools .
] she cannot simply claim easy victories .
] we were not part of creating the vlakplaas situation .
however , we are asking what they are going to do with the photos .
not a word from the anc in this regard .
] but i am prepared to bite the bullet on this issue .
i then said that most of those people were indigent .
the front-benches on that side egged on the crowd of demonstrators even more .
they would be able to catch a non-quota fish , but they need permits for that .
we have opened 3 435 new files for people from the eastern cape .
he is indeed my brother , my comrade , my mentor and my friend .
later that day , he was walking home with a fellow farm resident .
or do hon members still say that these things only happened before 1994 ?
will the minister of community safety , sport and recreation take his seat .
so often we talk about it , saying : let us get south africa working .
south africa cannot work for itself . we have to work for it .
we must take our hands out of our pockets and start working ...
then the hon member could at least smile while saying it .
] that hon member had his time and should just keep quiet .
any contribution to the coming local government elections must go to the iec .
the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism talked about delivery .
] the coloured people said , " open these facilities for us .
the new np should be worried about the hon premier 's performance .
he must read the january 6 statement about the problems ...
] madam speaker , i desperately seek your protection in terms of your ruling .
he must please allow the hon minister to make his speech .
bill read a third time ( anc dissenting ) .
secondly , it allows spending priorities to be made public over the medium term .
in education , particularly , outputs have remained high while contending with fewer resources .
the composition of budgeted own revenues for the 2000-01 financial year is as follows :
income from the province 's property portfolio is projected to net r29,9 million .
( a ) a limited scope for raising revenue on existing sources .
( b ) no clear distinction between user charges , levies and taxes .
vote 18 - provincial discretionary development [ pr 36 / 1999 ] ;
vote 19 - improvement of conditions of service [ pr 59 / 1999 ] ;
the hon premier asked me for an opportunity to make a statement .
i wish to refer only to a few recommendations in the report .
the committee supports the department in the creation of a preferential procurement policy .
that the minister take into account crime statistics during the redeployment of the community patrol officers .
the recommendations under the heading , " vote 7 : social services " , read :
my colleague to whom he referred practices zero tolerance .
mr speaker , what we have here is the corruption of laziness .
it is really not conducive to cooperation in this house .
however , there is grave concern about the revenue in respect of hospital fees .
however , excluded from this will , for instance , be the technicalities of the bond market and stock exchange reserves .
the contribution of the western cape to the national gdp is 14 % .
for example , one goes to the doctor and pays a r100 bill .
an hon member : you have a nice tie , mr isaacs .
i do not think that he need have any sleepless nights as far as they are concerned .
the anc know for a fact that it is a conditional grant .
] as far as the construction workers are concerned , most of the steel fixers are from gauteng .
the hon premier said , " gaan ons maandag al weer baklei ?
" , to which i answered , " nee , ons gaan nie baklei nie .
let me mention an example in regard to obtaining space .
the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism spoke about poverty relief .
] maybe if i had more feathers i could fly away !
mr speaker , i would certainly put it in writing any time .
in conclusion , mr speaker , i thank hon members for bearing with me .
] the microphone sounds a bit different to when i started .
the hon minister can expect it in the next couple of years as well .
] that is what the hon leader of the opposition said .
certain important information documents are still awaited from the national department of public administration .
i therefore focused mainly on the budgetary provisions for this strategic goal .
after all , it is what we promised in our strategic goal number four .
not use crude demographic criteria in public service hiring policy .
" abc " stands for " abstinence , behavioural change and condoms " .
we also accept the new audit division that has been set up .
to formulate that policy , she needs the advice and the help ...
transformation and reform in line with the transformation 2000 programme require fast-tracking .
this was apparently the maiden speech of the hon member mr e isaacs .
he is best known for doing two things ...
mr chairperson , i find that a very interesting point of order .
mr chairperson , i would like to raise the issue of the malaria clinic .
there are none so blind as those who will not see .
i thank her for the recognition that the disability desk is running .
] i have taken cognisance of what the hon member said .
much of what the hon member ms brown has said is true .
the hon member dr van zyl made a very illuminating speech .
mr chairperson , i would now like to answer some of the contributions .
one of the topics i used there was a ...
i thank the hon member mr e isaacs very much for his support .
i am so sorry that the hon member mr dugmore is not here .
in the report it said that there had never been any business plan .
as to the contents of it , we cannot , of course , debate that .
the committee supports the department in the creation of a preferential procurement policy .
that the minister take into account crime statistics with the redeployment of the community patrol officers .
the small a5 size hansard volumes have been replaced by a more user-friendly a4 size .
at the same time , the site must be a showpiece for a proud parliament .
in terms of affirmative action , the policy has been completed for this provincial parliament .
the cherry on the top is the catering facility here in this building .
madam chairperson , with a good budget a high standard is expected .
this should not be seen as critical , but rather as constructive .
we will have a better picture at the end of the year .
there is no mention about the dp in this letter .
mr speaker , i do not want to get involved in any fights .
] this was not an appeal before me .
at this stage a limited amount of r250 000 has been made available .
we have already said that no political party has access to it .
mr speaker , i would like to respond to one or two points .
that is the kind of experience which the hon minister had there .
the important point here is that the iec is going to run it itself .
the hon member should leave his petty politicking at home .
mr g r strachan asked the minister of economic affairs and tourism :
( v ) fish hoek : a case of arson was registered during february .
mr g r strachan asked the minister of economic affairs and tourism :
( 2 ) whether he will make a statement on the matter ?
mr speaker , i see that the questioner is still not here .
( 1 ) what progress has the wced made with the redeployment process ;
if it is not a promotion post the rules around redeployment apply .
the word " practicable " is used in both sections .
dr a e van zyl asked the minister of transport and works :
in addition , the recommendations in the environmental management plan had also not been satisfactorily implemented .
( 1 ) the four houses are situated in the admiralty zone .
can question 5 stand over in the hope that the hon minister turns up ?
as far as the questions for written reply are concerned , we shall attend to that .
i therefore rule that question 5 as well as question 6 provisionally stand over .
i am sorry , the hon member ms essop has had two follow-up questions .
i would like to thank the hon member ms essop for a nice question .
mr speaker , no , it is not run by cultural services any longer .
mr p c mckenzie asked the minister of community safety , sport and recreation :
( 5 ) whether he will make a statement on the matter ?
a full report by the chief information officer is on its way to cabinet .
the hon member should just address such a request to the table .
it was not merely an afrikaans festival ; it was a multilingual festival .
mr s e byneveldt asked the minister of community safety , sport and recreation :
the legal representative of the saps made the undertaking , without prejudice .
when the hon minister of education complained , he was indeed able to intervene .
in this regard reservist constable van wyk has been investigated by the icd .
the hon minister cannot continue to act inconsistently .
mr g r strachan asked the minister of economic affairs and tourism :
] the chairperson of the standing committee requested assistance from us .
mr g r strachan asked the minister of economic affairs and tourism :
we do not have all the answers , but at least ...
mr speaker , as far as we are concerned , we have gone one further .
] i said , " like i have signed the documents " .
the hon member should not put an answer into my mouth .
] i need to know who is doing the investigation into the second issue .
] he did not say the forensic audit .
mr m l fransman asked the minister of agriculture , property management and works :
( e ) the farm owner paid for mr mcotshana 's funeral .
( g ) all houses on the farm have the same facilities .
] it is very clear that things are being concealed from the house .
of these posts , 4 would be for deputy director-general , 10 for chief director and 30 for director .
in this new south africa there is no place for that mind-set .
mr speaker , the nicest thing of all is that we shall see ...
mr speaker , a person cannot go into this so easily .
mr speaker , i withdraw the words , " shut up " .
i want to tender my apologies for having been suspicious .
eventually it was seen that the anc had no hand in it .
that is why i want to be generous and say that i am sorry .
] that is what is happening there in those schools and they are being ...
( 2 ) whether he will make a statement on the matter ?
mr speaker , we have taken measures to cut down on the backlog .
mr m l fransman asked the minister of agriculture , property management and works :
for this reason i gave this project my full support .
mr speaker , the two ways of making complaints are very open .
mr g r strachan asked the minister of finance , business promotion and tourism :
financial implications for the province , that is an advantageous service / tariff ratio .
technological capability and potential consolidated cash management functions for the province with effective access control .
unfortunately mr mbuye and ms govan withdrew due to work pressure .
( a ) approval of drawings and design has taken place .
( b ) renovations to start towards end of august 2000 .
sir , i want to ask another supplementary question : how was the saps , ...
the provincial department is doing the auditing of the multi-journey ticket that is used .
now the hon minister blames the central government for his further delay .
he made a 100-day speech , not understanding the constitution !
the hon member has suggested that i am blaming them .
these erven include the land earmarked for the convention centre .
for the sake of clarity we can allow the question to be repeated .
mr z c stali asked the minister of transport , sport and recreation :
mr m l fransman asked the minister of local government and development planning :
if the hon minister agrees with this view i want to know why .
economic affairs - youth entrepreneurial programmes inclusive of persons with disabilities
mr g r strachan asked the minister of finance , business promotion and tourism :
( 4 ) whether he will make a statement on the matter ?
ms m g vantura asked the minister of transport , sport and recreation :
( 2 ) whether the dial-a-ride project is still in operation and in which areas ?
mr speaker , no decisions have been taken in this regard .
if a decision is taken about this , the normal channels will be followed .
" mr c m dugmore : mr speaker , i will definitely withdraw the word " deliberately " .
mr speaker , i would like to make an appeal to the anc .
] mnu m hoza : ndifuna ukuqonda ukuba le tafile kuthiwa yitafile ejongene nendlala , kanye kanye umsebenzi wayo yintoni na ?
does the hon member mr ramatlakane want to know how much the contract is worth ?
is the hon premier prepared to make a public statement on that ?
mr speaker , i wish to welcome all our honoured guests here today .
the western cape stands out against this gloomy backdrop as a world-class society .
let us rather use our common purpose as the catalyst for racial unity .
naturally , this is being done in close cooperation with all the relevant law enforcement agencies .
proposals are being formulated to ensure that the clean-up is a success .
together , let us make the western cape the cleanest , most attractive environment in south africa .
the last vote is vote 10 - economic affairs , agriculture and tourism .
i would like to suggest that it is not .
about 45 % of what we are voting on is in fact roll-over funds .
i know that the hon minister has it uppermost in his mind .
r121 000 to economic affairs , agriculture and tourism to cover fodder production costs .
unlike corruption in the anc , it does not happen here .
mr speaker , i was not referring to the hon premier .
] can they give me a better reason for their coming here ?
that also is one of the ways in which we empower our people .
it is anc and sacp propaganda , but the people will see through them .
] i would like to ask them if their conscience can bear it .
the anc knows that most of its constituency has been saturated .
the cabinet is legal , it is constitutional and , what is more , it is delivering .
the project amounted to r18,5 million and we are now seeing the results .
] and , of course , none of those hon members do !
( 2 ) whether he will make a statement on the matter ?
( 2 ) whether he will make a statement on the matter ?
( c ) at present most of the persons pay official tariffs for the quarters .
mr g r strachan asked the minister of economic affairs and tourism :
the hon member mr louis , quite correctly , often speaks about the private sector options .
dr a e van zyl asked the minister of transport and works :
mr speaker , i am not sure what the question is .
we bring this to the attention of the saps and the sandf .
for every 1 000 permits there are , there are 10 jobs .
this means that there are 10 000 people waiting for jobs .
i know the hon premier 's feeling about economic empowerment .
there are 1 000 of them , as the hon member has said .
since there is an objection , the motion will have to appear on the order paper .
] for too long have we allowed the 48-year apartheid handicap to increase .
who shifts the goalposts in this province when it comes to affirmative action ?
the members were then reappointed on 1 january 1999 as the national public service commission .
they have since started with a report on the representatives in the public service .
] we will continue drawing attention to those glaring issues .
i want to quote what he said when he read his budget speech :
however , madam chairperson , i would like to deal with the question of problem gambling .
i would also like to address the question of procurement that was raised .
with regard to procurement and the tender board , i would firstly like to express my gratitude .
] yes , that hon member is a johnny-come-lately .
i think i have unfortunately left out my colleague the hon member mr gelderblom .
the system is suffering advanced stress fatigue , as are an increasing number of saps members .
madam chairperson , i would like to say something about the training of neighbourhood watches .
this will now be implemented with intensive training courses during the year .
madam chairperson , i wish to convey my personal sincere thanks for their dedicated service .
mr chairperson , the western cape is a dangerous province owing to the high crime rate .
the question on everyone 's lips is : must a person in this province be white before one gets attention ?
in the historically advantaged areas , of course , the picture is very different .
one does not have to be a nuclear physicist to know that .
at this stage we only have 367 and the target is 770 .
the point is that 62 % of these projects are in the rural areas .
what are we doing to mobilise those inputs , so that we can react to them ?
they promised what they called a cape constabulary .
hon members are allowed short interjections , not full sentences .
this province 's crime problem remains a serious impediment to growth , investment and quality of life .
furthermore , i am encouraged by the department 's introduction of trauma units at police stations .
he and his team are achieving a great deal of success in the little karoo and the southern cape .
there are four items that the acdp would like to focus on in this debate .
as hon members know , carte blanche did that excellent programme on the elderly .
they get a bonus of about r200 to r300 once a year .
they do not have a housing subsidy and only get about r15,90 per hour .
madam chairperson , i think we need to give our people certain assurances .
is the hon minister aware that those same community police officers are also reservists ?
they talk about my lack of sensitivity with regard to the disadvantaged areas .
it is up to them where they want to deploy their cpos .
i have asked hon members not to make long interjections before .
i wish to make a courteous appeal to those hon members to refrain from this highly irresponsible behaviour .
] the speech will therefore be directed towards the hon member mr dugmore .
hon members will note that many of these events revolve around tourist related sporting events .
in my opinion , sports tourism is a major provider of income to this province .
this will be crucial if we wish to make an impact in this area .
mr chairperson , thank you for the opportunity to conclude my speech .
it is useless to speak of school sport when the conditions are inadequate .
we need to prioritise sport and tourism by making more funds available thereto .
there are many sporting codes we do not have in our townships at all .
sport keeps us healthy , teaches us discipline and sportsmanship and generates a healthy competitiveness .
i thank the hon member mr winde for avoiding the detours .
we should take it as a key element in building this nation .
as long as there are still imbalances , we are going to raise racism in this house sharply .
we are glad to see the re-establishment of the western cape sport academy .
for all of this , i would like to thank the hon minister and his department .
i want to wish the hon minister well with his deliberations in this regard .
is it because soccer is still regarded as a sport for black people only ?
the coaching this season has been the worst i have come across .
] perhaps i should have a legend with everything i say here .
what they did not provide was adequate green areas and adequate school sports facilities .
the hon member mr louis was not quite correct with regard to the funding .
this is already being improved by more regular cabinet media briefings .
experts on river-restoration will visit the western cape for two weeks in may this year .
the establishment of a malaria research centre in cape town is also on the cards .
we want to perform more than just an oversight and monitoring function .
i assure hon members that this government will continue such democratic practices .
on the other hand the anc government does not always practise what it preaches .
true multiparty democracy cannot flourish within a system of centralised power .
i believe the decentralisation of power through cooperative governance is the answer .
the western cape government supports the concept of " power to the people " .
i believe that the western cape government can contribute to making it happen .
it is also significant that this is the first bill of the millennium .
in accordance with the standing rules , the bill will be referred to the relevant standing committee .
joint committee amendments to preferential procurement policy framework bill [ b 66a-99 ] .
i should like to quote from the cape argus of 6 march 2000 ...
the hon member may put the contents of the motion without motivating it .
the chair would like to give the benefit of any doubt to hon members .
the dp is in the field working with poor communities .
hon members should please allow the hon minister to make her speech .
] the minister : i tried to tell him that in guguletu .
this is illustrated across our school system in almost every project we undertake .
we will extend this year planner to cover more matriculation subjects and other grades .
mr chairperson , our infrastructural development plan includes the rationalisation of certain schools .
i hope you do not want to break fidel castro 's record with speeches .
that is the benchmark of the hon member mr mckenzie , not mine .
fourthly , the nine industrial schools , which currently accommodate a mere 334 pupils , are being closed .
the next point i wish to discuss is the feeding scheme at the schools .
our anc government spends in excess of 24 % of the national budget on education .
the school 's library must also be one of the better libraries in the region .
i was privileged to benefit from his teaching .
it encompasses learning by doing , carefully observing , trial and error , sifting and checking .
today i want to focus on one particular school , manenberg senior secondary school .
several teachers from manenberg now serve in the department as area managers and circuit inspectors .
at manenberg the school fees are r150 per year , the lowest in the area .
she did not reach the top 20 , who , by the way , were all white .
i wish to thank him for everything that he has achieved in this regard .
i hope the hon member will also continue to encourage this .
i remember seeing the play , master harold and the boys .
the real budgeted increase for primary health care services for the 2000-01 financial year is 8,5 % .
- we are developing cost centre accounting and improved billing systems .
i think this is something that we shall have to give attention to in future .
at the university of wales hospital in cardiff i went to look at that .
entering into partnerships with the private sector is important for us .
the strategies will include improving hiv prevention and home-based care programmes , to mention but two .
the independence of the nac has been compromised , as far as i am concerned .
modern research can be performed in a satellite circling the earth .
madam chairperson , i very gladly follow the hon member mr jacobs .
needless to say , public / private partnerships are to be commended .
many victims , whether of stabbings , shootings or road accidents , need emergency attention .
in a tertiary hospital , this same patient would start off with the scan .
the hon minister should take note of it and try to help where he can .
he was poor and lived in a wood-and-iron house on his own plot of land .
he never regained consciousness and died on saturday afternoon at 17 : 30 .
the system failed abraham fortune and he died .
most day hospitals are poorly staffed and are not 24-hour facilities yet .
this process seems irreversible , unless we upgrade the quality of state hospitals .
inadequate staffing and outdated , malfunctioning equipment are adding to our woes .
he said exactly that in his speech on 13 september last year .
perhaps we are working on the scientific millennium next year !
] if that is his contribution to health , i do not know !
i addressed exactly what we have done in that department .
if one is sexually active , one should know one 's health status .
] we do have revenue targets and i will soon introduce a good revenue plan .
this will result in a fourteenth district office being established in eerste river .
at present the department is funding seven shelters for abused women and one comprehensive women 's centre .
five of these facilities are in the urban area and accommodate 160 women .
the one in crossroads is the urban one and it is a screenprinting project .
i also wish to refer to a children 's parliament , something that could be different .
madam chairperson , i now want to refer to social security and important aspects thereof .
the final phase of the project will be completed by 31 july 2000 .
madam chairperson , i did not say that i was going to use legislation .
approximately 1 299 job opportunities were created , 78 % of which were filled by women .
let me quote just one headline from rapport of sunday , 12 march 2000 .
i had to be honest and open for the sake of our constituency and our people outside .
however , this imc is now to be replaced by the provincial aids committee , or pac .
i think it is the sixth year that i have spoken on welfare ...
- the launch of awareness campaigns in order to create a culture of gender equality .
the hon minister asked how we could look the poor in the eye .
the economy of the western cape lost r100 million in household income alone .
we are spending r76 million on 144 institutions which cater for 25 000 people .
i would like to thank the hon member mr e isaacs for his contribution .
i want to link up with what the hon member said about the department .
the chair loves it when he hears the word " move " .
from 1 april 1999 to 17 february 2000 , 22 703 houses have been built .
a total of 70 local authority and provincial officials have successfully completed the course .
these funds are already committed and will give us precious little joy .
in terms of the policy guidelines formal tender procedures are not required in respect of housing subsidy projects .
the western cape provincial housing development board has also received an application for 680 institutional housing subsidies .
the rental housing act will bring the relief that those people need .
if someone does not want to take part in the body corporate , give him use of it for life .
the ospavats - hon members will remember them - they all had property there .
they stay in backyard shacks in hanover park , guguletu , borcherds , mitchells plain and langa .
section 26 says very clearly that everyone has the right to have access to adequate housing .
here in the western cape there is no standard house size for housing developments .
land release should be seen as a tool that begins to address housing need .
these are just examples , and the housing fund can add its support .
in the same breath , i also want to correct the hon member mr dugmore .
the hon member mr n m isaacs also talked about district six .
otherwise we must define it in more detail , and the hon member will simply ...
i have been saying for all these years that hon members must come and see me .
in my speech i said that these matters had been referred to the heath commission .
madam chairperson , thank you very much for the opportunity to deliver my budget speech .
since the inception of the programme 65 audits have been done in the western cape .
one of the structures is a structure within the province , namely a disaster management coordinating committee .
we must meet it as well and as efficiently as possible until 31 march 2000 .
these forums will start work next week and we wish them well .
" capacity " we define as either institutional capacity or financial capacity , or both .
they say they see no problems in relation to the category c municipalities .
when we deal with electricity provision , then we are dealing directly with the pockets of municipalities .
madam chairperson , let me conclude by thanking a few organisations .
weclogo consists not of only one political party but of various parties .
we can walk tall because the hon minister knows his subject .
again there was bad news : " we are waiting for the national government .
i do not know whether the national government is suffering from the brake syndrome .
the hon member mr ramatlakane is going to leave us very soon , because he is going to take over .
" he said absolutely nothing about the performance contracts from the 100-day programme .
we hope that that dp will not bring that attitude through to the transformation forums .
the hon member mr mckenzie has referred to a number of those problems .
provinces administer the housing programme and offer secretarial and administrative support to provincial housing development boards .
we need to ask our hon minister to look at the possibility of doing that .
the manenberg disaster has come and gone , but its effects still linger on .
i will not respond to every positive contribution made here .
the provincial law relating to disaster management was ready in december 1999 .
madam chairperson , i agree that we need a municipal systems bill .
i find it very interesting that he asks what happened about my voter education .
i want to tell hon members what happened in the metropolitan area .
he also asked what we were doing in regard to non-payment .
i am not saying that because i come from the municipality of oostenberg .
i want to thank the hon member louis again for his contribution .
if the acdp or the dp wants to do so , i say yes .
is the hon member ms phike prepared to amend the motion to that effect ?
the next matter is the initiation and promotion of bioregional planning throughout this province .
we should never again allow this type of planning to happen in south africa .
i hope that the hon minister is not going to contradict hansard this time .
this is resulting , as i have said , in many ad hoc decisions being made .
the most important aspect of this type of planning is that conservation then becomes sustainable .
next to it i also placed the development felicity act .
the hon member must be in his seat if he is going to interject .
bigger municipal areas will not necessarily have an effect on site-specific exercises .
madam chairperson , i am having difficulty finding all my notes !
when i left the cape town city council in 1998 i was the chairperson .
i went through it once , started again and then said , " stop !
the board will concentrate on the green issues and on promoting ecotourism .
similar to environmental affairs , we have shifted the paradigm of governance in cultural affairs too .
an amount of r602 000 is provided in the budget for this purpose .
my department and ministry will incorporate aids-related work in all the things we do .
sir , environmental education in the out-of-school situation should have the following aims .
instead , the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation is there .
the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs is a member of the board .
about 11 unions from all over the western cape attended the meeting .
the department also has condom distribution programmes at all its offices , remote camp sites and cultural centres .
i thank the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs for his presentation today .
there is a question i would like to pose to the hon minister today .
if this is the mission of the hon minister , we will support him .
madam chairperson , a culture of human rights is a fundamental condition for liberation .
accordingly the government has three primary duties - social upliftment , property rights and access rights .
last week i had a deputation of people calling themselves coastal constructures came to see .
] they have employment , but they have no work to do .
for that reason i appeal to the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs .
i spoke earlier about the capacity of the department to handle eias .
i must thank the hon member dr van zyl for her kind words .
the department will send at least three people , all officials , to this workshop .
i agree with the hon member ms versfeld that our ecosystem is deteriorating .
however , as i said earlier , this is the purpose of the cultural commission .
i want to quote from a letter received from the national department .
mr speaker , the anc gives its full support to the amended bill .
it has to do with section 96 of the municipal ordinance , wherein authorisation is called for .
the anc should be man enough to ask the people for forgiveness .
they expected people to pay rent to people in ...
these are people who stayed in sleeping huts and iron shacks in the townships .
we had better permit this so that we can have a peaceful afternoon .
mr speaker , the speaker was addressing the gallery .
the department is also involved in joint ventures at saldanha and century city .
owing to an inadequate traffic load , very few provincial roads will ever be viable toll roads .
municipalities will receive r2 million for normal maintenance and r2,3 million for resealing .
i require approximately r1,1 billion just to bring our buildings up to standard level .
the standing committee will be very closely monitoring the provision of parking facilities in the plan .
madam chairperson , i want to thank the hon minister of transport and works .
hon members can imagine the incredible unhappiness that resulted from that .
it was indicated that road construction or rehabilitation would receive attention .
i believe that as a result of the mtef process , the said planning has to be undertaken .
we in the western cape know what views the hon minister has expressed .
we know that everybody that has registered is already in the system .
the immobilisation of a car may mean that one removes its engine .
] are they going to turn the car on its roof and take off the wheels ?
] one knows that one can still drive safely with a great many fines .
now it is much easier to single out these cars .
the vast majority of the capital projects still go to the traditionally capital-powerful companies .
however , the problem is that everything begins with the provision of the tender documents .
however , political will compelled them to advertise the tender details once again .
the anc proposes that the department devotes more time to precontractual agreements .
the private sector is now asking the provincial government whether their money is acceptable .
i am sure that the tour operators of this province will echo these sentiments .
the hon member ms essop will recall that i thanked the labourers .
sir , i want to thank the hon minister of transport and works once again .
i am not referring to the transport programme , as he has spelt that out clearly .
i received the request from the company which the hon member represents .
my information is that health entrusted this amount to works for upgrading purposes .
( 1 ) there are 278 companies on the abe list .
] i am saying this because people are saying that we are not creating jobs .
i would also like to say to mr spence it is a job well done .
] all the provinces , and not only the western cape , will have to support him .
the hon member mr fransman referred to the people of the west coast .
as far as the sandveld road is concerned , we spoke to several farmers and potato farmers .
neither of the two roads is a priority at this stage .
when we make promises to the voters that cannot be realised , ...
the hon member mr gelderblom said that the increase in licence fees was small change .
mr speaker , on a point of order : sometimes i lose the motion .
hon members have the right to move a motion without notice .
if this matter gets out of hand , the rules committee will have to go into it further .
i am going to ask the service officers not to bring the bags around .
madam chairperson , if i could appeal to your great mercy !
thirdly , there is a mismatch between locally available skills and locally available jobs .
madam chairperson , the knowledge economy is often associated with intensified use of it .
it has become an utterly free market globally - and that becomes extremely competitive .
a company that started two years later than motorola is doing the same thing .
this company produces engineered solutions for the automotive industry , including parts for exhaust system catalytic converters .
their production is based on 40 subcontractors , with whom there is close collaboration .
in short , they must provide an adequate framework within which knowledge production and enterprise development can flourish .
the tourism system is typically divided into three components - demand , supply and support .
i will shortly be convening a first consultative meeting of role-players in the industry .
secondly , how best can the answer to the first question be implemented ?
as we all know , consumer protection is a concurrent competency in the constitution .
this includes the six schools where tourism has already been presented as an optional subject .
i have already informed them of what i am doing ; they are on board .
it is envisaged that at least 10 more offices will be funded during this financial year .
madam chairperson , i move on to business regulation and fair trade programmes .
] the board held 18 meetings at various locations outside the western cape .
the information on the register is currently being audited by eight firms of consultants .
it is envisaged that the audit process should be completed by the end of may 2000 .
hon members must please allow the hon member to deliver his speech .
however , as the hon minister knows , e-commerce has opened up the whole industry .
it is critical for good investment , including the bus and taxi sector .
it is good to see messrs james slabbert and kobus stander here .
they must just open their minds and not listen to all the negativity .
he extended congratulations to the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism .
notwithstanding these negative aspects outside , we as people of the western cape are still positive and optimistic .
that is the reason for my request for a coordinated industrial programme in consultation with the local authorities .
i welcome the hon minister 's announcements today in respect of the textile industry .
promoting greater job security in these sectors should be a key policy objective .
one thing that stood out was the issue of the tourism awareness programme at schools .
the hon minister had lots of time and we had very little time .
secondly , we will be holding hearings as the anc on racism in the workplace .
i now wish to deal with the contribution of the hon member mr louis .
the dilemma we have is that telkom has a monopoly in south africa .
i do , however , want to identify with the hon member 's reservations about capital gains tax .
i think the hon member even has sympathy with us in our dilemma .
groote schuur and elsenburg are both cases where we are doing work for line function departments .
the hon member gave a fairly comprehensive overview of industrial programmes for the entire western cape .
he can ask the hon minister of finance and development planning more about that .
because in many instances they do not know any language other than race language .
in accordance with the rules of the house the house will now go into committee .
madam chairperson , mechanisation and the green revolution are examples of technological growth .
in south african rand terms almost r300 billion is spent on agricultural subsidies and allocations .
with the allocation of r224 000 , this action will gain further momentum this year .
throughout the western cape the chief directorate : agriculture provides jobs in the form of manual labour .
in this way a very important earner of foreign exchange is being shot in the foot .
all the hon minister said was , " agriculture reaches out .
for instance , there are very few alternative uses outside of agriculture for a combine harvester .
our wheat production has different time zones , such as the wheat producing areas of rune and mossel bay .
by way of cooperation the people of vredendal have shown that they can produce tomatoes and sweet potatoes .
in this regard , therefore , i reach out my hand to the hon minister .
historically , agricultural communities have experienced large-scale inequalities in regard to housing , health and education .
let us examine the strategy of the western cape government , given this budget .
we must regard agriculture as an area in which there is equitable legislation .
we support these key objectives but we say that they are not enough .
that is to say , the allocation of funds to the subprogramme has declined drastically .
that was not through your doing , but through the anc .
one of those factors is the rebate that could be granted on diesel .
at present there is not even a possibility that they will receive disaster aid .
for every tonne of wheat imported by the miller , r800 leaves the country .
i have the letter from harold chickens from which the hon minister quoted .
argentina is dumping its mass of chickens here and the local market is suffering .
i am dealing with geography , and the hon minister is dealing with other things .
i want hon members to appreciate what this is in relative value .
i also wish to thank the hon member mr fransman for his contribution .
hon members can come to my office and look , and we should like to do that .
madam chairperson , are we not going to be allowed to ask questions ?
the anc would like to put it on record that we support the initiative and the principle of community police officers .
this is already being improved by more regular cabinet media briefings .
experts on river-restoration will visit the western cape for two weeks in may this year .
the establishment of a malaria research centre in cape town is also on the cards .
we want to perform more than just an oversight and monitoring function .
i assure hon members that this government will continue such democratic practices .
on the other hand the anc government does not always practise what it preaches .
true multiparty democracy cannot flourish within a system of centralised power .
i believe the decentralisation of power through co-operative governance is the answer .
the western cape government supports the concept of " power to the people " .
i believe that the western cape government can contribute to making it happen .
there they met with companies and travel agencies and were able to promote their businesses .
what message will these tourists take back to london , germany , europe and the world ?
mr speaker , will the hon member take a question , i wonder ?
i like the amendment proposed by the hon member mr ramatlakane .
] he knows how the hon member mr ramatlakane stated his case .
the hon member mr louis also referred to the pound for vehicles .
mr speaker , the hon member ms phenduka referred to the killing of mr ganuganu .
one wanted to become a bookkeeper and the other a social worker .
how different is the performance of the current minister from that of his predecessors !
the names of hernus kriel and others occur to me so easily .
spreading mandrax on the cape flats is part of that heritage .
that is because the heart of the problem actually lies inside the prison system .
underlying the transformation of south africa is the establishment of a human rights culture .
let there be a private member 's motion and a private member 's bill , and let us go forward with it .
now they come and say that that bible that we read is an apartheid bible .
the police are moving in one direction and justice in another .
] the consequence is that each one has its own way of doing things .
owing to successful operations such as operation good hope , initiated by the national government ...
i can already tell hon members what the general picture will look like .
at the moment there are 127 000 members in the saps , including civilians .
we have between 80 000 and 100 000 identified gangsters in the province .
do hon members think that the man who is sitting there withdrew his words ?
i pay the cpfs quite a lot of money with regard to projects , ...
with effect from 15 may 2000 , membership of committees was as follows , viz :
office of the premier : r j king , k a mqulwana , m g vantura
( v ) portfolio committee amendments to south african communications regulatory authority bill [ b14a-2000 ] .
( vi ) independent communications authority of south africa bill [ b14b-2000 ] .
( xi ) south african council for educators bill [ b26-2000 ] .
this documentation has not even reached the office of the auditor-general .
] here i have nine months of correspondence which the committee called for .
then , they used taxpayers ' money for a communication campaign during the election campaign .
it is an amazing about-turn , and nothing could be stranger than that .
chapter 2 , bill of rights , reads as follows , and i quote :
( b ) secure the well-being of the people of the republic ; ...
( d ) be loyal to the constitution , the republic and its people ;
( e ) respect the constitutional status , institutions , powers and functions of government ...
we believe that contract must be open to public scrutiny and accountability .
] many officials went to perform registration work , but did they really do registration work ?
mr speaker , as far as we are concerned this is a political scandal .
mr speaker , the same point was made a number of times by the national government .
that hon member must not give me problems about my speech .
madam chairperson , with respect , you are asking each minister to reply .
it is entirely up to the ministers as to how they respond to the questions .
this issue was steamrollered in the standing committee by a show of hands .
] does the hon member mr louis want to ask a question on vote 1 ?
vote 4 in schedule 1 agreed to ( anc dissenting ) .
if the hon minister of agriculture had served in the cabinet then ...
would he have thought that 20 volunteers from agriculture could do the work ?
furthermore , whether they have done the job or not is outcome-based .
that hon member has asked me where the r18 000 came from .
could the hon minister then explain to me when that money was reimbursed ?
] those hon members said they did not want to use teachers !
the hon member mr ozinsky should allow the hon minister to respond .
madam chairperson , i want to tell the hon member ms essop this .
in regard to the r3 990 , how many officials were involved and at what level ?
vote 15 in schedule 1 agreed to ( anc dissenting ) .
he referred certain things to the hon minister of finance and development .
i would like the hon minister to abide by that too .
was it r1 000 per day or r1 000 for the three days ?
the whips make decisions to the length of the day we are discussing .
could he rather not have shifted the money to waste management and sewerage ?
however , in this case i will speculate that it is possibly under personnel expenditure .
and the hon minister could not shift that money to another programme ?
before voter registration commenced teachers and senior staff also attended a one-day training course .
i would like the hon minister to respond to both questions .
mr speaker , i do propose that we have it now .
however , that is not good enough for politicians and the hon premier .
mr speaker , everyone has congratulated the hon premier on his 60th birthday .
again the hon leader of the opposition highlighted this important aspect .
through the newspapers we can identify key areas of elsies river , manenberg and mitchells plain .
i want to respond to something that the hon minister of community safety said .
indeed , that was the election promise of the hon premier and of the da .
we trust that the new year will bring him prosperity and happiness .
mr speaker , this announcement was received by rural communities with great appreciation .
city of durban which pioneered the implementation of municipal policing .
the hon leader of the opposition made much of spin doctors .
we have just heard the input of the anc spin doctor-in-chief .
an area in which i have worked in various capacities for some 25 years .
today she can speak about democracy and about crossroads being a constituency .
let us make this very clear to the hon premier and his colleagues .
it has fought for decades to unite all the people of south africa .
perhaps we should disaggregate these significant inputs for the hon premier .
this morning at 06 : 30 my aunt 's neighbour from tafelsig telephoned me .
] the short route was simply to pay the r250 for last year .
i think that the anc is a past master of that .
interjections can be allowed but we should not have a constant barrage .
the submission to cabinet includes a wide range of government and civil societies as stakeholders ...
unfortunately the hon minister of education is not present in the house .
he told the hon minister that consultation had not taken place .
he was the one who spearheaded the process of consultation .
it is not as the hon minister has told us .
we have a beautiful country with the potential to become a winning nation .
i must point out to the hon premier that the contrary is in fact true .
did the anc through their actions wish to create a distorted image of the producer ?
if we do that , the grass will grow in adderley street and in wale street .
however , mr speaker , i want to congratulate the hon premier on his opening address .
mr speaker , the hon premier also said , and i quote :
i was recently approached by a group of black , in the generic sense , tourist bus operators .
mr speaker , it is going to buy three submarines , aircraft and also nine gripons .
the availability of nevirapine in two other areas in the western cape is welcomed .
this is a modern theatre production aimed at aids awareness .
under programme 1 in vote 1 , r10 million has been rolled over on three occasions .
it is a macro issue , but it affects every single library across our province .
mr speaker , we are positive and we wholeheartedly support the second adjustments appropriation .
we wish to thank messrs africa and brewis from local government , planning and housing .
mr speaker , the tender went out and a gentleman won it .
the hon member will have to talk to the chairperson , not to me .
secondly , the hon member raised the question of donations to provinces .
mr speaker , i would like to address you on a point of order .
as far as the workings of the committee are concerned , the hon member has a point .
why was the southern cape chosen and not other regions of the province ?
the hon member is doing a little fishing there .
madam speaker , i am a fisherman and fishing is a good deal more pleasurable !
or is it his intention to enter into those partnerships with business organisations ?
the balance of that is urban renewal projects and so on , to which many people contribute .
the component linkages are the various components in the department of social services .
we did them a favour by correcting their errors in the meantime .
the minister in the office of the premier was appointed in november 1998 .
the minister in the office of the premier was appointed in november 1998 .

we are truly sorry that they had to be the victims of lawless barbarism .
on 15 april 2000 mr ganuganu , a bus driver of golden arrow , was shot dead .
can the anc state unconditionally that they are not behind the violence ?
i ask you , dugmore , do you also have your hands in the taxi violence ?
no taxi operators have been asked to represent their industry on the board .
] the person who introduced the debate spoke to this issue .
there is also the question of who issues the permits , the local road transportation board .
conflictual discussions and a conceptual conflict need not necessarily be negative .
] most victims in this scandal are women , children and the disabled .
they , cosatu and the sacp led a march to come ...
] when it suits the anc , they say : " be tough on criminals !
we have a compound located centrally that can take 600 taxis .
i would like to know whether they informed the other side of the coalition cabinet .
now hon members ask me why i do not close the taxi ranks .
if i close those taxi ranks , half a million people go without public transport .
] then they would ask me why more people had died .
" . mr speaker , i am sure that we can check the record .
mr speaker , the hon member mr ramatlakane spoke about the white paper .
the value of that segment of the bid was set at r140 million .
the team has a mandate to negotiate on behalf of the board of convenco .
permit me to briefly retrace convenco 's prior history or origin .
may is the lowest month for the year , and we need to extend that .
in his absence i want to thank the chairperson , the hon member mr louis .
subsequently , the gambling board declared sunwest to be the preferred bidder for the metropolitan casino licence .
cape town will , as the hon minister suggested , compete with durban and johannesburg .
it is a simple example of fine print and why we need to look at it .
in chapter 6 , under " conduct of members of executive councils " ...
the hon minister had very strong arguments about why it had to remain .
mr speaker , i thank you for the opportunity to reply .
he emphasised that these are very important meeting places in a global context .
this is a very good public / private sector partnership in that particular context .
i must , however , firstly thank her for reading those agreements .
there is brian mcdonald , who is the ceo and owner of global conferences .
it is in his interest that we actually have a conference centre in cape town .
i will now proceed to put the clauses of the bill .

provincial legislation must determine for each category of municipality the different types of municipality ...
once again we see that we cannot trust the new np .
and the survey results are supported by the national leader of the new np !
mr speaker , we say the hon minister made a political decision .
coloured people are also leaving the new np and joining the anc .
the new np in the standing committee were divided on these two proposals .
they had to adjourn in order to tell him , " this is the line !
mr speaker , did you hear how he carried on about the executive mayor ?
a municipality may make and execute by-laws for the purpose of effective administration .
i shall consult hansard and give a ruling on this later , perhaps today .
in brief , we say that this amounts to the centralisation of power in one person .
in a country where people are shot at right and left ...
the judiciary must and shall reflect the values and ideals of all south africans .
mr speaker , i have said that the motion presupposes an independent judiciary .
peter hain said at that conference yesterday , and i quote : ...

they say that what is happening in zimbabwe is going to happen here .
they took all the new np canvassers in vredendal - ms suzie ...
why am i raising a property-related issue when we are discussing small business ?
in fact , ms smuts said that we should institute a class action .
however , this sector is drastically underdeveloped as a result of stumbling blocks from the past .
a flexible labour market is a characteristic of all successful market economies across the world .
there is , in fact , no " but " - there is no doubt about it .

the western cape gambling and racing law came into effect in 1996 .
madam speaker , when we look around us what did our areas inherit ?
madam speaker , would the hon member take a question ?
] madam speaker , in short , the vast majority of middle classes in this country .
madam speaker , is the hon member prepared to take a question ?
indeed , for the information of the hon member mr mckenzie , those are the figures .
madam speaker , they worry about why we need higher rates .
madam speaker , the spurious arguments boggle the mind .
this is a transparent fact that the dp blindly refuses to acknowledge .
madam speaker , what we are talking about here is the issue of rates .
as we all know , it is not enough to simply do consultation .
hon members make it very hard to maintain discipline in the house .
he launched a direct attack on what is happening in the city of tygerberg .
sir , we cannot criticise mr chris du toit on this statement .
what we need is the right attitude among all in the farming community .
indeed , die burger of 2 august 2000 carries a report to that effect .
i do not understand whether you have made a final ruling on it yet .
i did not say , " the " but " a " .
in this instance i call upon the hon minister to withdraw it .
the motion contains the same element as motions put earlier this afternoon .
mr speaker , the horse-racing industry has now been regulated for the last three years .
mr speaker , i would firstly like to mention one issue in this debate .
this chairperson of the executive committee now becomes the traffic manager in the south peninsula .
] and that side of the house associate themselves with things like that .
] all of a sudden we hear for the first time that there have been irregularities .
] i would appeal to him : the allegations ...
mr speaker , today again we have heard sensational accusations from the anc .
mr speaker , we shall do so again if the circumstances call for it .
he has become as sleazy as the company he keeps now .
that there was a vacancy because mr wiley resigned from parliament .
mr speaker , their sensationalism today has actually blown up in their faces , ...
this is the legal parameter in which we are basing our accusations against the hon minister .
this is simple enough - all his interests are now in a family trust .
they will have , within approximately 60 days , to publish a report on the matter .
] why is he so dead set on sitting on the convenco board ?
we want to know when he in fact handed over his business interests to a family trust .
i have read the motion of the hon member ms essop very closely .
the hon member can ask him that question , but during any ...
sir , let me just tell the anc one thing .
] those are pertinent questions which i think we should be dealing with .
we need to say to the hon premier that it is a small sacrifice .
- essop said she has full knowledge of the companies act ...
of a conflict between their official responsibilities and private interests ; ...
the hon premier acknowledged my letter on 14 october 1998 .
it is a question of what are calculated and considered risks .

the judge 's finding is painful and blunt : " we are all guilty and we all belong in the dock .
today i want to encourage everyone who occupies a leadership position by quoting jos 1 : 9 :
every single hon member of the house has a responsibility in that regard .
and the two " hottentots " to whom reference was made there were two female colleagues .
what all these cases have in common is that they run along racial lines .
racist attitudes are not the sole property of the whites in this country .
that is unfortunate , but not the denial of a right .
the election results did not leave much flexibility in choice variations .
i attended a debate in the ncop two or three weeks ago .
the anc 's motion called for a provincial perspective on nation-building and transformation .
let me go on to challenge the hon minister of social services .
who is representing the disadvantaged community that lives in guguletu and khayelitsha and langa ?
those are the words of yvonne woods , not someone in the anc .
] yes , if that is hate speech , we submit that it is hate speech .
what they do through their hate speech is oppose transformation systematically .
but , sir , the anc discriminates against black people , africans , and that concerns me .
instead , the anc now propagates a " two nations " theory .
this , somewhat bizarrely , is despite our democratic constitution and bill of rights .
all 25 members of his branch will vote for him in the mayoral election .
when we started here , we had more than 85 000 officials .
no one has denied that the top structure of the party is not right .
here i come to the words , " everyone is talking about affirmative action " .
that the house wholeheartedly supports the mayoral candidature of the minister of social services .
- r103,2 million to finance capital housing programmes ; - r2,8 million for hospital rehabilitation ;
this pamphlet deals with the whole issue of the allowance and so on .
i find it tragic that the anc is generalising with reference to individual incidents .
mr speaker , the agricultural industry is an important role-player in the western cape economy .
the employer must act in a respectful , tolerant , cool-headed , logical and humane way towards his employees .
] our policies are clearly aimed at the upliftment of all of our people .
] i could mention a few examples , but let me confine myself to this example .
i say this because this occurs even among the ranks of those hon members .
yvonne woods said , " coloured people breed like rabbits and they stink .
ten to one he wanted to have a holiday , rather than live in a farce ...
this has nothing to do with politics .
] in this house we have discussed it for the past 12 months .
the case was postponed until 9 november 2000 awaiting the result .
in this instance too the prosecutor was not prepared to prosecute .
" i wish to state clearly to everyone that this is an outrageous lie .
mr speaker , let me put it differently - perhaps they will hear then .

bills received from national parliament and tabled in terms of rule 208 :

the hon minister of social services and poverty relief may carry on with his speech .
i regret that the hon minister 's time has just expired .
mr speaker , i would like to concur with the hon member ms essop .
" the last refuge of incompetence is a resort to frivolity .
] i refer to the quote , because the quote has a bearing here .
i want to remind him that valencia campher was killed in this province .
] this is the plummeting confidence and trust that the hon premier speaks of .
these categories inform political debate even in an economically advanced country like the usa .
it speaks to building non-racial unity and providing resources .
the days of the anc 's stranglehold over south africa are on the wane .
it is this arrogance or power-virus that is affecting that side of the house .
mr speaker , yes , the da has won the election in the metropole .
mr speaker , the hon member mr mckenzie served in the tricameral system .
] the hon leader of the opposition can never trust those people .
could you please protect me ?
no , i do not need to read it , because if you ...
the hon member mr byneveldt has now said it six or seven times .
sir , the person who wrote that is a very well-known member of the anc .
] it was not that hon member , it was mr ben turok .
in addition , the voters no longer detect any spirit of enthusiasm in the anc .
we are laughing simply because the hon member addressed you as " your honour " .
the anc government 's conduct reminds one strongly of the autocratic tendencies of the past .
mr speaker , the da 's councillors are committed to excellence in service delivery .
but the point is this : when are they going to follow his lead in this province ?
we should give the hon minister a chance to deliver his speech .
working class art forms and cultural expressions will be recognised as valid forms in their own right .
there were no children who passed with exemptions at manenberg high school .
the da suffers from exactly the same thing that the old np suffered from .
the hon member mr ozinsky said that we should reach out to one another .
i will go into more detail about this when my budget is tabled .
the day before yesterday the hon premier loudly and proudly said , and i quote :
i would like to emphasise a point which was made by the hon member mr strachan .
i would also like to congratulate the hon premier on his opening address to parliament .
the hon member mr fransman is not the man we know .
i can assure them that the election was not all about the race card .
another objective is to contain the spread of hiv and tuberculosis .
i do not know what the hon member ms vantura was doing there .
she raised many concerns about women , children , the elderly and the disabled .
yes , we never see the da there - but we are there .
as hon members know , the transitional process went smoothly and service delivery continued .
] they were prevented from doing so by national and provincial anc members .
that hon member should actually not be sitting in the house today .
the house adjourned at 17 : 39 until 9 february 2001 at 08 : 00 .
( 2 ) expresses its sympathy to everyone who suffered damage ; and
( 4 ) whether the former minister is a shareholder in the company .
it is a pity that this is not always and in all spheres a two-way process .
let me turn my attention to contributions from that side of the house .
i will deal with the contribution of the hon leader of the opposition in a moment .
i do not know where the hon member grew up , but i did .
the letter is addressed to dr frans booyse , a chief director in the wced .
it is common knowledge now that there is great division in the wced .
this illness is aggravated by an epidemic known as benguism .
i cannot agree , however , with the new admission age for our schools .
we believe that unity remains a great challenge to the provincial government .
after all the ceremony , the choral singing and the flower-girls , hope had to come .
mr speaker , let me quote freely from the hon premier 's address .
sir , let us look at what the cape argus of 8 february 2000 says .
the hon premier was part of the government in the time of dr death .
i challenge the hon premier to accept responsibility and take it further .
yesterday we were entertained by a very emotional rendition of our south african history .
over the past few days , racism has been placed under very close scrutiny .
i am now quoting the hon leader of the opposition in the western cape .
] our unemployment rate of 17,9 % is half of the national average .
what the government wants to do is to interfere with the impartiality .
it is our contention that , in fact , the iec has not requested assistance .
are you prepared to fire michael sutcliffe as head of the demarcation board ?
i regret that the hon member mr isaacs 's time has expired .
she runs between cape town and guguletu , resulting in disunity at that primary school .
they know that they are still making sure that this province belongs to them .
the hon member must be allowed to proceed with her speech .
] the recent support and membership of prominent muslims is an indication of this .
these commissions reflect the demographics of the province and will ensure responsible governance .
the people of the western cape are tired of the rhetoric of the anc .
the anc 's response is to insult this house 's intelligence .
] you must come to me because you must identify your needs .
why is an hiv research centre not established in addition to the malaria centre which is being planned ?
people should realise that hiv / aids is with everyone in society .
is the latest cook perhaps called the national aids council , or the nac ?
much more than wearing red hiv buttons and pins will be necessary .
mr speaker , is the hon member prepared to take a question ?
no , what they do ask is : how will the anc run the province ?
he led the mayors out of there , and that is where we stand at the moment .
the hon member mr ismail yesterday pointed out what happens with the ministers .
the hon member quoted very selectively from section 181 ( 3 ) .
why do people in south africa have to pay to apply for an identity document ?
a sharper analytical instrument would be asking what people do about crime .
hon members should please allow the hon member to make his speech .
we look forward to the hon minister of education 's reply later today .
] they were not willing to commit themselves to democracy in the western cape .
this is quite apparent from the few people who do turn up now and then ...
currently taxi operators do not pay tax . they put the money in their pockets .
it is wonderful to have somebody in the house doing sign language .
" i said , " why did you serve that man before me ?
] that is exactly the point i am making .
] it is a case of " four legs good , two legs bad .
] this almost led to the closure of 700 of the schools .
in the car-hiring budget of the mec , in the ghost teacher budget , or where ?
i would like to rectify something , the notion that we are running from the registration issue .
mr speaker , when i was young i went to the circus .
it has taken me 30 years finally to see the boneless wonder !
after that they still stick to their policy of maintaining white supremacy .
mr speaker , i now refer to the hon minister of local government .
details will soon be given by the hon minister of finance and development planning .
what is happening to some of our day clinics in the plettenberg bay area ?
i stand before the hon member mr marais humbled by his courage .
please allow the hon minister of agriculture to deliver his speech .
so that we can ensure that we maintain the job creation potential in the rural areas .
in his reply , president mbeki said that he would give special attention to this .
madam speaker , on a point of order : that really is most unfair .
the hon premier spoke about education , and it was such wonderful education .
] they said , " but hold on , we will find someone .
the hon member mr winde is sitting in the wrong place to heckle .
i would like to have more days like this when i am speaking .
let us compare the achievements of this province with those of other provinces .
may i ask hon members not to deliver a running commentary , please ?
allow me , mr speaker , to say a few words about budget reform .
it appears that insufficient improvement has been achieved with respect to poverty reduction in the province .
mr speaker , i turn now to the main features of the budget .
( c ) there must be an overall improvement of financial management and loss control .
own revenue potential is currently largely limited to user fees , mainly at hospitals and motor vehicle licences .
motor vehicle licenses continue their upward trend due to improved collection and annual increases in license fees .
in recognition of this problem , the western cape treasury implemented a revenue retention scheme .
this revenue will be generated from various sources in the 2000-01 financial year , namely -
the debate on the second reading will take place on monday , 6 march 2000 .
portfolio committee amendments to financial services board amendment bill [ b 62a-99 ] .
financial institutions ( investment of funds ) bill [ b 6-2000 ] .
i now come to " vote 4 : community safety " , and i quote :
perhaps the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation should listen to me .
mr speaker , i would like to return to the budget more directly ...
mr speaker , this budget is aimed at doing two things .
however , the hon leader of the opposition had to say something in his reaction .
the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism may proceed with his speech .
mr speaker , have you ever experienced anything as infantile as that ?
this department has no policies , no plans and no consultation .
we are raising revenue and budgeting money without any idea as to what we are budgeting for .
section 228 ( 2 ) ( a ) provides that this , and i quote :
rather , people are already spending money on security guards , boundary walls , alarm systems and that type of thing .
we congratulate the hon premier on his sterling efforts regarding the voter registration campaign .
the gdp of the province is higher than that of the national government .
mr speaker , the other issue the anc harp on is poverty relief .
we have spoken about voter registration and referred to it as " een snaar " .
in order to appoint this consultant we had to work through the tender board .
mr speaker , i now want to deal with hon member mr ozinsky .
] it was on her watch that that money was not spent .
madam chairperson , i am tempted to do two things this afternoon .
however , let me return to my department of provincial administration or vote 1 .
these are all projects aimed at organisational development , skills training , job creation and human resource development .
i am so sorry that the hon member mr dugmore is not here today .
this summarises the philosophy underlying the new management model in our province .
supported by the public service regulations , 1999 , the model most definitely mainstreams public service reform .
we will need to reassess the census figures to reflect the real needs for delivery .
meanwhile people out there are dying of aids who have never used azt .
the question was put in a cape times editorial last week .
i cannot imagine why they continue to harp on that so .
madam chairperson , on a point of order : that is a conditional withdrawal .
the reduced project budget for the 1999-2000 financial year for my office was r664 000 .
he would have to define poverty alleviation , locate poverty alleviation within the provincial administration ...
one of the greatest challenges in 1999 has been the acute shortage in legislative drafting expertise .
legal advisors from all the provinces , as well as the national parliament , attended the workshop .
the national department of public service and administration has shifted the implementation date in this regard more than once .
this meant that the concerns of women were seldom expressed and acknowledged .
in other words , it is a choice between non-racial change and race-based transformation .
our criminal justice system and protective labour laws err on the side of the criminal .
what is clear is that she managed to establish a youth desk in november 1999 .
public participation is a key element , because one needs guidelines from them .
in any business , one of its greatest attraction features is its marketing capabilities and communication .
i now turn to the hon minister in the office of the premier .
all it does , it delays the process of reaching one 's goals .
mr chairperson , i gladly follow the hon member mr e isaacs .
however , we should start reflecting the demographics of our population in the western cape .
the ruling party in bulgaria , the cnu , contains all the remnants of nazism .
mr chairperson , is the hon minister prepared to answer a question ?
we thought you could teach us something .
then their remarks will go into hansard and we will be able to study them .
does the hon member mr ramatlakane want to address me on a point of order ?
madam chairperson , parliament 's budget for the 2000-01 financial year is r21,615 million .
they were assisted in this by a professional investigation sponsored by the european union .
however , the caterer also underestimated the task and started off with inexperienced staff .
it does not address the demographic constitutional requirements of the province .
madam chairperson , today we are debating vote 2 - provincial parliament .
it is like a person that needs accommodation to run a constituency office .
we should rather take that r500 000 and provide interpretation in the standing committees .
madam chairperson , i wish to thank everyone who has participated in the debate .
i want to respond briefly to a few matters which the speakers highlighted .
we can certainly invite former members to participate in our activities .
we will look at this matter , as discussed at the chairpersons ' workshop .
i have already referred to the fact that we are trying to look at the smaller parties .
the hon member mr ozinsky spoke about consultation with both parties ...
mr speaker , it is my pleasure to respond to the two questions put .
with the hon premier 's approval , i would like to reply to the question .
the amount of r250 000 has not yet been applied for .
the moment the iec requires it , we will address the matter .
the reply to part ( b ) of the question is as follows .
the iec will make a request and the iec will undertake it personally .
mr speaker , the photographs that are taken are locked away .
the privilege of this house is being abused by the wild allegations made here .
this task should be finalised by the middle of the year 2000 .
it is the city of cape town , a unicity , that is going to be developed .
the first report on progress is expected in the next two weeks .
( 2 ) how many fire-fighters were involved in fighting the fires ;
( 4 ) how many litres of water were used in combating the fires ?
] i do not want to mention names because he is sitting right opposite me .
( 3 ) what is the time frame for the commission to report ;
mr speaker , perhaps that question must be directed to the hon premier .
one official worked without any remuneration from 3 to 5 december 1998 .
right-sizing , based on the institution 's establishment , where educators were in excess .
( 2 ) i thought we had finished the process in 1999 .
( 5 ) when will legislation be introduced with regard to the commissioner for children ?
( 2 ) there are no guarantees of the effectiveness of rehabilitation .
] that is my business , not the business of the hon member .
the point raised regarding the period 1996 to 1997 is an acceptable one .
it would not be correct for me to interfere with that sphere of government .
the minister of environmental and cultural affairs ( on behalf of the minister of health ) :
annual grant applications must be submitted in the form of a business plan .
( ii ) artscape - no subsidy was paid to artscape ; and
some of the participants became successful entrepreneurs after attending these workshops .
i am quite prepared to table it , mr speaker .
mr speaker , i do not recall having said that .
what i said was , and i would like to quote my exact words :
on the other side , where wesbank is , no fence has been erected .
mr speaker , has the hon premier been to any of these queues ?
is there not a prescribed format for the oral questions to the hon premier ?
i believe that by cementing our relationships , it can only benefit our province .
is there something else that the hon member mr byneveldt wants to blame me for ?
to tell the truth , i do not know what this interpellation is about .
the vast majority of the 376 cpos are utilised in previously disadvantaged areas .
the submission represents the view of this branch as outlined in the green paper .
] clearly , it is the responsibility of the standing committee chairperson .
what actually flabbergasts me is the fact that we as the province ...
secondly , the hon minister of transport and works has kept his word .
these are opinion-makers , unlike those " unopinion-makers " over there .
there are electric lights inside , there is water and there is a latrine .
mr speaker , it is very clear that we live in two worlds .
i understand why the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works says this .
mr speaker , with natural attrition the public service can become far more representative .
the hon member mr isaacs must withdraw the words , " shut up " .
it has been indecisive and incoherent in dealing with this issue .
they have to do with the ills of the legalisation process in transport .
hon members know it is an extremely difficult issue to deal with .
let me turn now to the hon member mr n m isaacs .
] in conclusion i want to express the hope that this never happens again .
i want to restrict the follow-up questions to three so that we can get through the question paper .
mr speaker , given your ruling on time , i shall rather withdraw .
mr speaker , it depends what the hon member means by it .
in fact , it is a complete oversimplification to accuse one side of racism .
i can find out and give the hon member mr ismail the information .
in a certain sense the hon member mr ozinsky is ridiculing it .
is it still the intention of the hon minister to outsource ?
( f ) a training course for participants were arranged for 9 to 12 may 2000 .
does the hon member mr king want to address me on the point of order ?
i am not aware of any discrimination against black workers at elsenburg .
however , to date not one of the accusations could be substantiated or any evidence produced .
if she knows of such cases , she must bring them to my attention .
( 2 ) let me put the intent of my 100-day speech into perspective .
( 3 ) i think we have made significant progress on my 100-day objectives .
commitment of the bank to the macro-economic strategy for growth , employment and redistribution ( gear ) as well as to smme development .
mr speaker , the hon member mr byneveldt must get his facts right .
included in this , of course , was the management of the payment of subsidies for passenger transport .
five years down the line , it is business as usual in this province .
the hon member ms essop will have to try to explain it further .
( b ) since this post did not exist , this question falls away .
unfortunately i am not in a position to give a breakdown .
( 2 ) which persons at the schools are responsible for the prevention strategy ;
official police records will show that it was an application for a peaceful placard demonstration .
] mr speaker , that , i believe , is the modus operandi of the anc .
i want the hon leader of the opposition to listen ...
however , all these things , especially in the season of goodwill that is coming up , scare off tourists .
] that is what every government department does , including those of the national government .
[ i would like to find out what the actual role of the poverty desk is . ]
i will find out and give the hon member mr ramatlakane the figures .
mr speaker , this is my last question to the hon premier .
the provincial aids council of the western cape will hold its first meeting later this month .
in this process wesgro and lanok will also be involved in the policy and development process .
it is an appropriate time to suspend business until 15 : 00 .
the standing committee expressed its concern about the continued rolling over of funds .
mr speaker , this has happened against the background of a number of things .
it has also been mentioned by the chairperson and the hon member mr strachan .
mr speaker , i wish to mention two issues regarding roll-over funds .
these amount to r11,2 million , and comprise grants to support :
r2,65 million to community safety for the provision of a closed-circuit television monitoring system in vanguard drive .
i trust that all hon members will respect the traditions of the house .
who has he marginalised or set aside to get him here ?
] those hon members should not misinform the people out there !
patrick promises has lied in the past and patrick promises will lie again .
mr speaker , i would like to go further , and i continue to quote :
] i did not see the hon leader of the opposition there .
] because it is delivering , it must obviously be a tremendous embarrassment to them .
mr speaker , i would like to address you on a point of order .
i have given a ruling on matters that were placed on the order paper .
he is making a political speech .
let us allow the hon leader of the opposition to proceed .
yes , it is very clear from the order paper that that is the case .
( 2 ) what plans are in place to prevent further spillages ?
an amount of r70 million has been budgeted for that over the next two years .
however , one must remember that this spillage happened in november 1999 .
we all remember what happened in the sonchem disaster where people died .
there are people living near and in the area of the sewage works .
there was a reference to the black mack sewage pipeline running from zandvliet to macassar .
that sewage pipeline is used to transport sewage to macassar in emergencies .
the biggest spillage was on 14 march , and was caused by a pump problem .
mr speaker , the hon minister of local government spoke about capacity .
it has been reported that the capacity sometimes goes up to 90 megalitres per day .
mr speaker , i thank the hon premier very much for that answer .
if the hon member wants to score any political mileage out of it , he is wrong .
that shows hon members that we are in a rather desperate situation .
market-related rentals change from place to place , depending on what the house is .
it is an inept government that can allow this type of thing to happen .
perhaps hon members can do something about it for the people of the western cape .
hon members will know that this formed the basis for the final 2000-01 budget .
the target of the pawc for total representation was set in 1996 for 1999 .
simply mentioning revenue generation does not mean that we will have a knee-jerk reaction .
scof has stated that it supports the efforts to create a preferential procurement policy .
madam chairperson , perhaps it is prudent to start from a more macro perspective .
madam chairperson , imagine the economic impact should we adopt these proposals .
this is a dramatic and welcome change from the rules-based approach of the past .
it is about any additional revenue , which could mean privatisation , outsourcing , and so on .
at national assembly level the new np has supported the budget .
] he has the courage of his convictions , and therefore he could do it .
think of where the tender board was when we started here five years ago .
madam chairperson , i now come to the next point that i want to highlight .
it is a pity , but this point deals with affirmative action and equity .
madam chairperson , i am going to deal with each point as i come to it .
i did not take it down in full , but he had it written down .
] i will support his submitting any allegations he has .
madam chairperson , i then move to the hon member mr n m isaacs .
if it is information that i should have , it must come to me .
why do i sketch this sorry picture , and is there hope for the future ?
the work of the department of community safety is rendered in two very distinct fields .
the aged themselves were motivated to march against abuse through their towns .
the general concept is to provide young adults with an intensive personal growth experience .
groups of 200 will be trained as opposed to the current groups of 50 .
matric , physical fitness and minimum height requirements will be preconditions for entry into these courses .
the department adopted a multi-agency approach as the key to the successful local crime prevention operations .
i do not think we are going to have much success in controlling that .
" the police , in turn , say : " no , i have nothing to do with that .
note my choice of words , " the dp and new np coalition in the western cape " .
] that is what die burger says , and that is what the hsrc opinion poll says .
consideration should also be given to extending the term of the cpf management .
this programme certainly has merit and must be given the support it deserves .
you see , madam chairperson , the votes have been obtained and the election is past .
madam chairperson , it is a pleasure to enter the debate today .
only some 12 % of serious crimes in this country result in convictions .
long delays in response time and inadequate equipment endanger all our lives all the time .
this means that there is a tremendous workload on the policemen and women .
i am glad to see that the saps are focusing on the elderly .
i must say to the hon minister that project chrysalis is an outstanding project .
the hon minister is on a collision course here .
now the hon minister is talking nonsense , and he knows that .
we shall also contribute to economic growth in the province by promoting sport tourism .
included in this amount was r650 000 for the western cape sports academy ( wecsa ) .
i think it came to a little over r600 000 .
there are capacity problems that surface from time to time , mainly from sadtu-directed teachers .
sir , the community games projects were launched successfully last year in different communities in the western cape .
i want to thank him for the funds that his department has made available to ussasa .
we should take them to our townships to talk about hiv / aids .
none of them have any resources at all , especially not sports fields .
vast sums of money are generated and spent in the top echelons of many sporting disciplines .
when the advertising rights for the super 12 are negotiated , millions of rand change hands .
today a six-member fifa team arrives in this country for their investigations .
this is particularly important in sport , where we already have inadequate funding .
we appreciate that the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation has partly delivered .
we look forward to supporting the hon minister in this particular vote .
in vredendal , for example , there were enough sports grounds and sports facilities , and in citrusdal as well .
surely it cannot be because mr barnes does not have the expertise .
when we say that we want to host them , it is probably a misnomer .
for every r1 we put in , we probably get back r50 in economic turnover .
as i did mention to the house , we are proactive in this regard .
they also have very severe participation schedules that may prevent them from coming .
too many of us smoke and too many of us have sedentary lifestyles .
if they come to us with a specific project proposal we can encourage these organisations ...
as far as the 2006 soccer bid is concerned , we have a surfeit of facilities that may be utilised .
the house adjourned at 17 : 38 until friday , 10 march 2000 , at 10 : 00 .
despite budget constraints we have delivered to all our people , especially the poor .
mr speaker , the government takes pride in governing and delivering .
the financing of the nyanga community centre project - construction will begin this month .
the department of community safety has consequently developed a proactive preventative initiative called project chrysalis .
i should like to convey my congratulations to the hon minister of transport and works .
the rainbow across our province is a multi-textured and colourful one .
the hon member mr byneveldt may not motivate the motion in moving it .
the speaker pointed out that he had gone too far in respect of one point .
it is too easy and simple to blame the legacy of apartheid alone .
this is partly why there is such an obsession with matric results in this country .
mr chairperson , i want to start by discussing the transformation of reformatories and industrial schools .
in their place two special youth care and development centres will be established .
i am not sure whether the feeding scheme is to be terminated at all schools .
i do want to ask that the wced urgently investigates this matter .
since 1994 , educational change has been at the centre of a larger political and social transformation in south africa .
again i think the main problem was a lack of consultation and participation .
mr chairperson , i think i still have two or three minutes left .
the second example i want to mention is the twinning of schools .
i also wish to thank mr o ' connell - he saved my life !
in february , from a potential amount of r144 000 only r60 000 has been collected .
he also provided a very good outline of the new dispensation for our students with behavioural problems .
a dedicated inter-hospital ambulance transfer system has been introduced in order to release ordinary ambulances for real emergencies .
the new and improved specialist outpatient department at the red cross children 's hospital will open in july 2000 .
the " c in " service " stands for " caring more " .
concerning the establishment of a national aids council , i have already expressed my concern .
clinical and medical research can be an important source of income for the health sector .
between 1993 and 1996 there was a 13 % increase in tb cases worldwide .
madam chairperson , i take pride in taking part in this debate .
i wish to refer to study , training , general staff development and the recognition of this .
like many others , abraham fortune also voted for the first time in 1994 .
it would be like putting a strip of band aid on a tumour .
the ffc 's formula for allocating funds to the provinces needs to be reviewed as well .
the fact that he is employing 58 is a drop in the ocean .
this report states that the intention was to close 100 chronic psychiatric beds .
yet the total of staff decreased by more 11 % during the year .
madam chairperson , i will come back later to the hon leader of the opposition .
well , if hon members will wait , it will be in the next 10 minutes .
the bill on a health facilities board is still at the legal department of the province .
] he will report to this house soon about what we have done .
we want to make it a non-political body , while at the same time ensuring the involvement of politicians .
unfortunately there has been downscaling , but it was necessary to stay within the budget .
when i was in the committee , the hon member mr silke was there too .
we are busy with a work study to see how we can improve that .
this is a market that we should very much like to have back in our hospitals .
madam chairperson , i want to begin by thanking the hon member mr marais .
with the support of the work study component , the branch embarked on a restructuring process .
regarding the district offices , the cabinet identified their restructuring as a priority area .
the district offices must also be aligned with the structure of the head office .
there is also the concern that we need to look at the reallocation of funding .
against this background , the department of social services facilitated a policy framework for street children .
i am not going to mention this further , but i will respond if necessary .
the decision was taken to diversify a little and 1 000 hens were bought .
no hawkers or moneylenders will be allowed on the premises of the paypoints .
with effect from 1 april 2000 the third reduction in the state maintenance grant will take place .
to date 22 officials have been reported to the department for alleged involvement in fraud .
an amount of r11,586 million was allocated to the province by the national poverty relief fund .
a total of 137 projects were funded through the allocation of funds for the 1998-1999 financial year .
however , attention will now have to be given to the capacity aspect of the structure .
based on this policy document , a strategic plan of action has been compiled for the department .
we need only recall the scof meetings we had .
the only worrying factor is the monitoring of those institutions of incidents of child abuse .
the results of the gender audit would be made available to us by february this year .
madam chairperson , the hon minister talked about " the effective utilisation of funds " !
] i wonder whether those poor people in mitchells plain will be able to eat that .
suddenly they found themselves without any income or drastic reductions in income .
her meaningless talk has once again been peppered with false , subjective and selective data .
he mentioned the court cases , to which i shall refer a little later .
most hon members referred to children , institutional matters and the policies that are available .
we need proper discussion with the hon member mr ramatlakane about elukhuselweni house .
he referred to the nisec / denel case that is taking place at the moment .
but must be retained to make provision for the need for affordable rental accommodation .
if he feels that he cannot participate , let us give him a life right .
they selected a good board , of which the hon minister can be proud .
mr chairperson , you were not there this morning , so you missed a lot .
it goes further in section 26 ( 2 ) by stating that , and i quote :
we are saying that there is enough land for housing in the metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas .
i have just mentioned the examples of du noon , happy valley , delft and macassar .
i thank him sincerely for his hard work and for that of the board .
why must there still be people for whom the dice fall badly ?
we must also be able to build new , integrated , nonracial communities that know no colour .
coast development construction is an example of what these developers do to our people .
they should not be giving running commentary or speaking in paragraphs or long sentences .
when hon members come in here , they must at least make certain of their facts .
these audits are aimed at identifying the financial and management ills at municipalities .
in exceptional cases , such as that of beaufort west , it will be increased to r600 000 .
there really is not contingency planning and urgent attention will have to be given to this .
hon members know that there will be one unicity municipality , five district municipalities and 24 local municipalities .
regarding the non-metropolitan areas , a day or two ago i established district transformation forums .
the composition is based on the number of councillors that are now in the non-metropolitan area .
] i do not think that we will have problems about this with the political parties .
i want them to get together in the district transformation forums and negotiate about the issue .
if it was 3 % , 4 % or 5 % , that will have to suffice .
i want to ask him if the new np support the writing off of the rental arrears .
all over the country reserves are being plundered to fund the anc 's extravagant election promises .
because anc-controlled councils are quite incapable of paying for services .
it makes one wonder to what extent the dp will give its cooperation .
i think 90 % of the identified municipalities fall under categories 1 to 6 .
i think the hon minister should look very urgently at the larger municipalities also .
i am pleased to see that 43 % is being spent on financial training .
thirdly , we are making an appeal to the public to make local government work .
that figure has gone down to 4 % of the people actively involved .
madam chairperson , the hon member mr n m isaacs spoke about disaster management .
the hon member mr mckenzie also said that there were always references to tulbagh .
he must get his facts right about what happened in the metropolitan area .
they were the last municipality because they were the largest municipality that had to unbundle .
the hon member mr silke made a contribution for which i sincerely thank him .
mr speaker , i object to the motion being moved without notice .
these workshops have been attended by representatives of local government , environmental bodies and affected communities .
( f ) regularly monitor and assess its performance against its integrated development plan ; ...
mr chairperson , i hereby note my full support for this budget .
in the south peninsula council , which considered the dassenberg application , the vote was 4 : 3 .
in fact he wants to address this particular matter rigorously .
when he appoints people of colour and women into these positions , that appointment package must include mentoring .
the hon minister talked about racial representivity , but of course he missed gender representivity out completely .
the bulk still remain at the level of administrative clerks and chief administrative clerks .
we had to pay so much money , and then we still had to pay an enhancement levy .
i am pleased to hear that the hon minister has withdrawn the review board .
i took the planning act , act 7 of 1999 , and went through it .
madam chairperson , i would like to turn now to the issue of the pdc .
] with the current cost of living , i would like the state to keep me .
it will address the integration as soon as the new municipalities are in place .
i move on to the hon member mr gelderblom and thank him for his support .
it will also be a partner in land management programmes and some 70 further conservation areas .
under the tenure of this ministry , the environmental commissioner will come into existence .
and for her sound cooperation with the standing committee on education , environment and cultural affairs .
when a tourist visits the western cape , what does he / she expect to find ?
the cape coons have always been close to the heart of the western cape government .
it is not true that this is going to be a process of peer review .
max , why do you not talk about the tribunals of the dfa ?
i should like to quote from the submission by the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs .
but r10,146 million has been made available for this commission , and it is a great deal of money .
we are also pleased about the commissioner for the environment that is coming into existence .
according to this index one third of the natural resources world-wide have disappeared since 1970 .
for a community or communities in the western cape , sharing a common cultural and language heritage .
they were funded twice for a cultural festival and then for " erfenisdag " as well .
we are dealing here with decent and responsible leaders - i know them .
the hon minister and i are both new hands as far as this matter is concerned .
we also spoke about apologising or acknowledging mistakes .
the hon minister of education is in the wrong seat for making interjections .
what the hon member has raised would generally be a local government issue .
is the hon member prepared to exhibit the underwear in the house ?
i am going to allow the hon premier to move a motion without notice .
( a ) the provincial cabinet be reconstituted to include black south africans ;
mr speaker , we will certainly be looking at amendments to some of those regulations .
i make no apology if people did not pay rent , because ...
the weighbridges will be jointly manned by staff from the private sector and provincial traffic officials .
the intention is to replace the contract as a whole by march 2001 .
madam chairperson , i want to thank my staff for their good service to me .
madam chairperson , i gladly follow the hon minister of transport and works .
his budget of r650 million makes him an empire-builder of the first order !
every time the inner-city people ask , " what are we going to do to create a new inner-road system or a rail system ?
the acdp strongly believe we must find alternative ways to generate revenue .
last but not least regarding this department is toll-roads .
the hon minister today reported on numerous projects that works is involved in .
there are 10 000 buildings in the province with a budget of r57 million .
i counted as many as nine of them at one parking place alongside the road .
i take it that he will come and visit us when we inaugurate the worcester-robertson road .
this matter has been the subject of heated debate for almost three decades now .
we know programmes like clean and green that the hon minister referred to earlier on .
that hon minister would deal with it on an ad hoc basis or as an add-on .
the anc will continue to fight a process that excludes small and medium enterprises .
madam chairperson , i want to thank the head of the department and the officials .
if he does not ignore the summons , he will see that it comes out of pretoria .
he cannot go to the magistrate 's office or the traffic chief to make representations .
must the small contractors pay exactly the same money determined according to the axle mass load ?
most interesting of all is that the contract is still largely in white hands .
more pressure must be exerted on such companies to assist emerging entrepreneurs .
over the past two years proposals have been made for the development of the west coast road .
even when driving into parliament 's parking area , one picks up lewis 1 .
since then the new speed limit of 100 km / h for these vehicles has been introduced .
madam chairperson , it is an honour to take part in this debate .
mr strydom and his construction teams have done a tremendous job over the past two years .
the anc policy on cigarette butts is , " get rid of your stompie .
now there is another case that i would like to bring to his attention .
they then instructed the principal to have the cisterns removed .
i am not interested in the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation .
we received r0,5 million for this , and we are going to utilise it for that purpose .
a cabinet decision was taken that every department that generates revenue may use that revenue .
we are certainly going to get toll-roads in the western cape ; it does not matter where .
i do not have to protect him , but hon members are making too much noise .
many people put the licence disc next to the rear-view mirror or in the top left-hand corner .
no. madam chairperson , the hon member mr ramatlakane also referred to job creation .
smmes have been involved in every school that has been built in the province since 1994 .
he also referred to the dp , on which i will not comment .
we can then be recognised as an issuing authority , that can also collect fines .
the hon member mr mckenzie made a great fuss of the increase in licence fees .
] she will not know , because it is very difficult to determine .
that fuel levy was collected inter alia for remote roads , the rural areas and district councils .
we have already announced that the increase in the fuel price is taking place on 1 june 2000 .
] the new np and i have represented the west coast for the past 16 years .
the next person to whom i wish to react is the hon member ms rossouw .
i do not think that i and messrs petersen and du preez are satisfied with them either .
i want to thank the hon member mr winde for his support for the budget .
he also referred to the toll roads act , which was passed last year .
he referred to the current bus project , the road fatalities resulting from bus accidents , and the speed limit .
the name of the hon member mr mckenzie appeared unexpectedly on the speaker 's list .
he also spoke about the people who throw their cigarette butts out of motor car windows .
she must take care , there is enough scope for her .
i shall therefore consider it and give a ruling as to what will appear on the order paper .
madam chairperson , i would like to suggest some of those causes .
there seems to be great excitement around the bags that hon members received .
if we are to create jobs , we need to tackle these underlying causes of unemployment up front .
the executive replied , " no go , there is no future for aol .
we are a substantial creator of new technologies and we quickly absorb existing technology .
turnover has grown by over 200 % in the past three years .
secondly , there is also overwhelming support from industry players for the compulsory registration of tourism enterprises .
we foresee that these functions would not be performed by the provincial marketing agents .
in this province the property management component came into being on 1 january 1999 .
outsourcing of larger parts of this function is a priority function of the cabinet .
it also contains a variety of tourism institutions - from the board to satour and craft action bodies .
the development bank of southern africa has made r210 000 available for pilot projects in seven communities .
yesterday we launched an awareness project for primary schools at the eikendal primary school .
the aim is to cultivate a tourism culture among the youth from an early age .
madam chairperson , the tourism industry is of course no exception to the rule .
i am sure the hon minister of agriculture will want to dwell on that later today .
thirdly , we will give ongoing support to the stainless steel sector through the workplace challenge .
they have also produced an excellent western cape exporters guide , which i recommend to hon members .
the provincial liquor board continues to function under the national liquor act of 1989 .
madam chairperson , they do not like to listen to effective delivery .
once audited , these will be captured on the department 's mda property management system .
secondly , we are well advanced with the concession on 130 hectares of land at elsenburg .
madam chairperson , as hon members have noticed , a huge array of work has been done .
] i , as standing committee chairperson , serve him as the responsible minister .
" we know about what national government is doing regarding overlegislation and overregulation .
at least our export fruit has made a positive contribution to the improved economic growth in the western cape .
the new np is positive about the export potential of the manufacturing industry in the western cape .
we were born and bred here and our way to europe runs through africa .
we on this side of the house will support the hon minister on key initiatives .
i just want to refer to the accommodation institutions of the city of tygerberg that are advertised therein .
the only field in which they deal with informal traders is business regulation , or the regulatory aspect .
those events will obviously be very important initiatives on the part of the anc .
the hon member essop knows , of course , that she still has two minutes left .
we have to position ourselves to be an attractive production centre of this worldwide network .
they have a wonderful publication , cape africa , which i will recommend to hon members .
the hon member attacked me on my campaign against an unconstitutional national bill .
that is why we have to consider decriminalising enforcement of the liquor act .
unfortunately the hon member mr r williams played the race card .
it is very clear that the strategy of the anc is to spread a message ...
madam chairperson , the anc have become the merchants of hatred in this province .
if they want to create jobs in south africa , they should start taking a hold on their alliance partner , cosatu .
this is mainly due to the export nature of the fruit and the wine industries in particular .
in our sister province of bavaria 5 % of the budget is spent on agriculture .
south africa 's competitors such as australia and new zealand pay virtually no tax on diesel fuel .
the quarantine on the movement of horses was lifted on 15 march 2000 .
madam chairperson , i want to condemn in the strongest possible terms the occupation of farms in zimbabwe .
a country such as greece with its dry climate gave its people 16 years .
and our government wants our farmers to achieve this level within two years .
more than 52 000 workers and 150 000 dependants are involved in the industry .
it is unfortunate that an effective risk management strategy is not yet in place .
the history that they are writing is the success story of agriculture in the western cape .
the western cape province is known as one of the most stable agricultural regions in south africa .
insolvencies are growing day by day , and even el nio plays a very important role .
a farmer may contribute 3 % of his eligible net sales into this fund .
one measure would be the renting of specialist equipment or the voluntary sharing of assets .
legislation has not made this problem any easier to deal with ; on the contrary , legislation has made it worse .
] it is specifically they who spoke dynamically in favour of the property clause .
i am very pleased that the hon minister says that we must take a dynamic look at land reform .
this appears in schedule 4 of the national constitution and can be complied with .
unfortunately the department does not specify what is meant by " whole community " .
madam chairperson , we must support a number of initiatives established by the national government .
as regards human resources and the top management of the department , drastic intervention is required .
in the deciduous fruit industry , the table grape industry , the wine industry and the grain industry a very difficult time is being experienced .
there is a fear that some of these farmers will not survive .
diesel fuel could equally be pumped into the tank of a pick-up truck out of a boat .
this decision seems to me more of a political than an economic one .
in western cape agriculture we look at the agricultural economy , and it is under pressure .
the illegal slaughtering of cattle and sheep specifically in the vredenburg district has increased drastically .
unfortunately , when it comes to import control it is a matter for the national government .
there is another point that i should like to convey to the hon minister .
madam chairperson , it is a privilege to participate in this debate .
madam chairperson , it is true that the milk price has dropped by 50 % .
mr hanekom , when he was minister of agriculture and land affairs , dismissed him .
therefore it is not as if we are neglecting to devote attention to beginner farmers .
they should ask the hon minister of education to establish agricultural schools .
it is very difficult , because it forms part of one vote .
architectural profession bill [ b17-2000 ] .
engineering profession bill [ b19-2000 ] .
despite budget constraints we have delivered to all our people , especially the poor .
mr speaker , the government takes pride in governing and delivering .
the financing of the nyanga community centre project - construction will begin this month .
the department of community safety has consequently developed a proactive preventative initiative called project chrysalis .
i should like to convey my congratulations to the hon minister of transport and works .
the rainbow across our province is a multi-textured and colourful one .
( a ) reach an agreement for cheaper drugs for hiv / aids ;
mr speaker , i gladly follow the hon minister of transport and works .
we need to understand the political background in the western cape regarding the taxi problem .
for instance , in khayelitsha the taxis are forcing the buses out of the area .
the province has indeed used all the powers that that act affords us .
the anc needs to emphasise that if the hon member mr ramatlakane was removed ...
i thank the hon leader of the opposition , at least sanity now prevails .
on the other hand , there is agitation that the buses should not enter there .
it is because the taxis cannot cope with the mass of people .
an area may be closed only for a period , until the situation is sorted out .
the hon member mr fransman knows what the hon member mr ramatlakane said .
it had been my intention to table the amendment bill on thursday last week .
the hon member mr ramatlakane spoke about the islps , and we can discuss that .
the hon member mr winde said that the rights of people should be protected .
] if anybody wants to do anything to me , they will only harm my body .
that is why we will always have problems of this nature .
i now wish to thank the hon member mr n m isaacs for his contribution .
he referred to the provincial constitution and to the hon member mr dugmore .
hon members can rest assured that i shall ensure that they get the message .
that same evening i was at a memorial service in uitsig for amelia and bianca .
we talk about the checking of any person and of vehicles for illegal weapons .
a government 's number one priority should be the adequate protection of its citizens .
the human race is threatened by a minority of groups calling themselves terrorists , gangs or psychopaths .
the gangs have fire power that far exceeds the fire power of our own policemen .
it is the only other level of government with its own revenue tax base .
it is safer to be a criminal than to be a law-abiding citizen in south africa .
i believe that dr boesak is now also in a five-star jail , i do not know .
mr speaker , the constitution stipulates that one has the right to life .
he has in his very typical fiery manner outlined the problems with the criminal justice system .
it is almost like a voice from the past that we hear here .
the need for a culture of non-violence and human rights is now more important than ever .
do you think killing children in the townships was good ?
if the policeman brings an accused before the magistrate 's court , justice decides no , he will get bail .
they are tired of continuing to live in a prison in a new south africa .
what is happening on the cape flats is an absolutely disgraceful tragedy for the country .
the national government provided a little money , but this was a provincially driven operation .
in approximately 80 % of these incidents that took place recently , criminals were caught .
( viii ) national house of traditional leaders amendment bill [ b15b-2000 ] .
( h ) co-operate with one another in mutual trust and good faith by -
] finally , it has a great deal to do with the divisions in the coalition ...
i think that the hon member mr ozinsky exceeded the bounds with that remark .
two days after the request for volunteers came , the cabinet decided ...
mr speaker , is the hon member prepared to take a short question ?
mr speaker , the hon member mr ozinsky turned around and went on to say ...
the hon member mr strachan was actually trying to say that there had been complete mismanagement .
this includes bringing about the systematic and orderly management of fiscal resources .
it is also in answer to what the hon member ms essop said .
are 787 937 people not exceptional enough to be able to spend this money ?
i assume that the hon minister in the office of the premier will respond .
in committee stage the normal procedure would be that the ministers should be able to respond .
that was the responsibility of the hon minister concerned on each of these occasions .
i am not going to deviate from the procedure followed in committee stage .
mr chairperson , could i address you on the ruling that you have given ?
the auditor-general would have applied his mind to it , posed questions and requested detailed answers .
i would like to know from which programme and subprogramme that r3 795 was taken .
this money was transferred to the provincial revenue account and it was spent on our behalf .
at the end we will make another ruling , in conjunction with the speaker .
can he remember , from the cabinet discussion , what the average payment will be per volunteer ?
madam chairperson , let me start right at the beginning and anticipate the other questions as well .
i have heard people say that we are going to pay r1 000 a month .
madam chairperson , if the hon minister would just understand the processes in connection with reimbursements .
madam chairperson , on a point of order : as you are ruling we are going through this .
they were three young ladies who are lower in rank than an assistant director , and one messenger .
any hon member of the house can ask questions to any hon minister .
we still have a western cape adjustments appropriation bill , but that is not the biggest concern .
each hon member on that side will ask three questions and we will answer .
if it is approved by this house , it will be done in terms of the adjustment estimates .
vote 7 to 10 in schedule 2 agreed to ( anc dissenting ) .
madam chairperson , i am motivating the question that i want to put .
] it is amazing that nothing appears in schedules 1 and 2 .
their track record does not induce me to take that without further question .
i have no speakers ' list before me , so i put the third reading .
immediately after that the hon minister of finance and development planning can deal with the next order of the day .
mr speaker , i am very pleased it did not happen today .
that is the phenomenon of gangsterism on the cape flats and throughout the city .
the western cape provincial government has shown that an effective government can make a difference .
regular patrols in the areas where crime is most common are of course a must .
we cannot use the excuse that there is no money for monitoring cameras .
is this the delivery by which the hon premier says that the western cape should be judged ?
i want to respond to the hon minister of education , who referred to crossroads .
what she forgot to do was to thank the anc ...
finally , let us speak about the western cape economy as part of the national economy .
this is a small issue , and the hon minister of education makes it a small issue .
it is important to have clean communities , and the focus on this is interesting .
because our destinies are so entwined , we have to jointly find a solution for it .
it is also about speaking about the most vulnerable in our society .
the anc has proved once again that they are not interested in constructive solutions .
there are a number of organisations that work in community structures that were not consulted .
i wanted to respond to some of the issues that she raised .
mr speaker , it is indeed a pleasure to be back in this place .
i know it depresses the hon members on the other side of the house .
the attorney-general is investigating it ; it is not even necessary for us to investigate it .
] the hon member ms phike referred to one of those incidents .
they also had to pay r5 per loaf for the bread that they had bought .
the cherry on the cake was the leadership of the anc in the western cape .
] it is not i who say that , read the newspapers and talk about it .
is it an earthquake such as the one in india , which has swallowed up thousands of people ?
this adjustment can therefore be seen as further initiatives which the department could launch .
the one issue is the amount of r10 million for poverty relief that continues to be rolled over .
one thing i can say is that the jargon at least has changed .
mr speaker , i would further like to point out that it is not r2,650 million .
perhaps their friends , mr mowzer and company , should have given greater thought to the matter .
the hon member mr strachan has a point when it comes to good working relationships .
unfortunately i did not hear the question because somebody called me over .
madam chairperson , it does not strictly relate to the matter under discussion .
this particular project is not in fact a direct link with grandwest casino .
] no , it is not a question , i am making a point of order .
if sunwest got a group of people together , i was not aware of that .
] that hon member should wait , he is not in court now .
mr speaker , i am grateful that the subject was put on the order paper .
an interdict has been served on the taxi association , but they have taken no notice of it .
this government will not permit itself to be held captive by empty threats .
on 16 april 2000 a number of buses and drivers were threatened and shots were fired .
he cited the name of the hon member mr dugmore in his speech .
there needs to be a consolidated plan to regulate and consolidate the industry .
the radius-to-routes licences must be completed and the whole recapitalisation process must take effect immediately ;
mr speaker , my first direct experience of taxi warfare was in the early 1990s .
when that happens , there will be no basis for the taxi industry at all .
] i phoned the provincial commissioner and i told him it was unacceptable .
the hon member ms phenduka kept on talking about constantia and places like that .
only once a crime has been committed can they react to it , if they are lucky !
] they must not talk about blood on any hands on this side .
mr speaker , i believe that the taxi industry have not taken us seriously .
there are 400 permits at the local road transportation board that have not yet been fetched .
he said : " minister , i beg you not to close down the ranks .
the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation referred to the national government .
the three shareholders , who are the three public entities , entered into a shareholders ' agreement then .
firstly , let me sum up why cape town should build an international convention centre .
this was obviously from the 24 000 runners , with their support and so on .
there has been an enquiry already at the cape metropolitan tourism 's convention bureau for 2011 .
the agreements relating to the companies act and the shareholders are something totally different .
cape town already has a strong base to make it a world-class tourist destination .
the need to involve the private sector more closely in government activities deserves special mention .
this new tourist attraction may plant the seed for further international investment in the western cape .
mr speaker , on both counts , the standing committee on economic development have failed .
at that level the anc has tabled its objections to the process .
they do not have a common understanding of the definition of " province " .
i said i would keep quiet and raise my issues here today .
we speak the talk of empowerment ; let us walk the talk of empowerment .
last night i went into the website of convenco and extracted the list of board members .
the hon minister of finance and development planning has private interests in the hotel industry .
" there is no recusal clause in the first shareholders ' agreement or the second agreement .
there is already conflict , although the project management team was supposed to be a partnership .
i do not yet quite know whether the anc supports the bill or not .
in the old days they built cathedrals in cities ; these days they build convention centres .
the hon member mr gelderblom singled out some really critical aspects , in my opinion .
the hon member 's point concerning keeping politics out of tourism is very valid .
on who owns the shares , the voting shares are owned by the public authorities .
i therefore put the new clause 3 ( 2 ) , which reads as follows :
however , it still remains redundant because both shareholders ' agreements were covered in subsection ( 1 ) .
the house adjourned at 17 : 31 until 10 : 00 on friday , 23 june 2000 .
therefore we are today considering provincial legislation capable of establishing the various types of municipalities .
mr speaker , we had a discussion with the acting chief whip about this issue .
mr speaker , it is a privilege to participate in this debate .
the hon minister testified before the standing committee the other day .
mr speaker , our proposed paragraph ( g ) was , and i quote :
he comes here with his fire-fly politics - an unlikely marriage .
there sits the hon member mr ramatlakane - he is also on his way there .
mr speaker , the udm supports the western cape determination of types of municipalities bill .
it would have been quite simple merely to allow the options .
mr speaker , i am very grateful that i am also able to participate in this debate today .
he said that he supported the bill in principle but had problems with detail .
what is striking , mr speaker , is the selective morality displayed here .
has the judiciary in fact given way before the attacks of the anc ?
this report underscores the need for governments to pursue democracy and , obviously , free market policies .
mr speaker , thank you for the opportunity to participate in the debate .
mr speaker , this institution is one of the fundamental components of our society .
here i would like to refer the house to the case of the s v abrahams .
are they supporting thejudiciary by increasing the budget of the department of justice ?
we have other anc politicians who are in high prosecutorial positions at the moment .
mr speaker , to be friendly i want to thank everyone who participated in the debate .
hon members will remember when the so-called liberal whites controlled the cape town city council .
the hon premier lived in a township before he moved to retreat .
they love it , so that they can do some populist waving now and again .
what the anc wants to do is prevent a united opposition in south africa .
] that hon member belongs to the sacp , which is the 0 % party !
] we have always supported it here and we support it in zimbabwe .
however , let me tell the hon member mr ozinsky a thing or two .
i have looked at the motion introduced by the hon member mr mckenzie .
] this is another important point that we must mention to one another here .
we must also tell one another that the new np was not happy .
we were furious while we were in discussions about the process of luring our council members away .
what has been said here today concerns white politics of the new np .
it is true that there was a statement , and the hon member mr fransman got away with that .
the new np is on record as being concerned about the poor .
furthermore , unfortunately at this stage there are no mechanisms in place for credit rehabilitation .
a number of programmes and institutions have been established to promote small , medium and micro businesses .
they , too , are job creators ; they , too , deserve respect and better treatment in our economy .
on 14 june 2000 there were hearings and i attended most of them .
it is , in many ways , a colour-blind issue , but they have identified the problems .
it is linked very often to the old apartheid lines of south africa , which were racial lines .
at least , if i were the anc , i would say , " well done !
sir , the second thing is that smmes need three things to survive .
first report of the standing committee on public accounts , 2000 , dated 9 june 2000 .
mr speaker , may i have protection against honest member ms adams ?
i believe that the gambling industry is a moving industry ...
madam speaker , i would like to talk about pinelands which is also a dp stronghold .
then when we had the next election their slogan was , " swart gevaar " .
the anc and the new np support the masakhane programme and people 's paying rates .
madam speaker , the people who pay rates on residential properties are soft targets .
the hon member mr silke is not prepared to take a question .
the solution to punitive rates is a different and more innovative approach to municipal finance .
madam speaker , i want to refer to a few issues that have been addressed here .
the first point is the computer-supported system that we can use in the legislation .
] that we must accept and i do not think it is a problem .
i wish to emphasise another matter and that is the power of the minister to make regulations .
the hon member mr dugmore referred to a specific point of the anc .
i saw that the anc chief spokesperson on local government , mr mowzer , made an announcement .
however we are specifically considering how the anc wants to shift its service levies to taxation .
of course there must be a compassionate policy but we must specifically examine water .
] over the past number of years corrections have been made in regard to valuations .
i shall also not be able to refer to previous hansard reports in regard to hand signals .
that is why the hon member mr king asked what was happening in worcester .
i actually feel compelled to keep hon members for two hours !
agri sa , and of course agriculture western cape , are among the biggest providers of employment in south africa .
those who are guilty of this violence are farmers , farm workers , gangs and perpetrators of family violence .
are we not dealing with distorted interpersonal human relations with role-players on farms ?
the hon minister says that things are going well - that was what a farmer did .
however , as i said , it cannot be seen as a precedent .
the increases must be seen against the escalation that had already occurred in 1998 .
mr speaker , the root of this problem is crime and nothing else .
first report of the standing committee on public accounts , 2000 , dated 9 june 2000 .
i think that owing to the nature of the motion the house can be unanimous in that regard .
mr speaker , the anc supports the western cape eighth gambling and racing amendment bill .
they have also obtained 337 successful convictions , with 59 cases still outstanding .
mr speaker , the anc supports the western cape ninth gambling and racing amendment bill .
residents , ratepayers and civic associations are constantly raising issues relating to these matters .
this meant that he was no longer a member of the task team .
i want to know what the hon premier is planning to do about that situation .
the hon member knows that that is not a point of order .
mr speaker , when i received the request i appointed the task team .
as hon members know , a task team will cost us nothing at this stage .
does the hon member mr ozinsky want to address me once more on the ruling ?
up till this stage i still had no reply from the task team .
for easy reference , i can give hon members a copy of it .
] he has then gone ahead and the board of convenco gets a legal opinion .
it is because the board is filled with the friends of the hon minister !
mr speaker , we are waiting for the public protector to investigate this matter .
these interests , as the hon member ms essop has said , were not declared .
it goes further , inter alia , and i want to quote par 3.3 of the code of conduct :
and " the member " refers to both the national and provincial cabinet members -
let me read from the legal opinion , and i quote :
as minister of tourism i formed that company more than 12 months ago .
was the hon minister part of that decision or did he recuse himself from it ?
if he voted or asked for a three star hotel , why did he do so ?
i do not compile the agenda - the ceo compiles the agenda .
because that hon member would not understand what service to the community is .
mr speaker , what is the meaning of exposing oneself to a risk ?
is it a risk to live next door to a neighbour who owns a bull-terrier ?
] they will have to find more money or crawl and apologise .
i want to know whether there is no counter-espionage process in the entire intelligence service .
they knew the hon premier was going to appear there , but nothing was done .
however , the members of the intelligence service were totally relaxed , as if nothing was happening .
now gaddafi is a hero , but when the gaddafi was involved in the same things ...
it is addressed to the editor of the cape argus , and i quote :
secondly , there must be no resort to general indiscriminate repression .
in the western cape it appears as though prosperity belongs to whites alone .
thank goodness i was not in the hon premier 's cabinet .
then , 0,8 % are african , while 25 % are coloured and 4,4 % are indian .
we have opposed this kind of thinking for decades , and we will continue to do so .
mr speaker , i want to thank the hon member mr byneveldt for his motion .
this is implicit in every word they speak and on every platform , ...
racism is today , mr speaker , the only glue that holds the tri-apartheid alliance together .
] why are people being defined according to race at the instance of a political party ?
not the anc , not the national government and not the human rights commission .
the hon member mr byneveldt must answer the following question honestly and with integrity .
mr speaker , in conclusion , i would like to quote from a song by bob marley .
i shall attempt to respond briefly to a speech made by each of them .
mr speaker , every department has budgeted money over the years for training .
it will be recalled that i referred to some of these during my 2000-01 budget speech .
the total cost of r168 000 will be financed from savings within the vote .
the reason i moved this motion is to change that impression .
the anc has a responsibility to fight racism wherever it occurs .
this does not mean that the anc is against the farmers , certainly not .
by using a few actions such as these to generalise , is irresponsible and outrageous .
indeed , i regard this as a slap in the face of the farm worker ...
i believe the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works will elaborate on that further .
karools booysen is a labourer at langeberg stud in simondium , just outside paarl .
encouraging emerging farmers through support centres to provide access to finance ; ...
making sufficient land available for aspirant farmers , starting with unused state land ;
] the hon member mr n m isaacs preferred to live in a farce .
sir , kofi annan , the secretary general of the un , said and i quote :
no. what the hon minister and others are trying to do , is always good .
they are very concerned because the da is concerned about the situation in zimbabwe .
the number of charges that are laid and the number of convictions are two different statistics .
] that is an effort that could mean something positive for the entire south cape .
( viii ) portfolio committee amendments to local government : municipal structures amendment bill [ b51c-2000 ] .
the unauthorised expenditure in respect of election costs amounting to r2 190 was considered .
i am listening carefully to what the hon minister of social services and poverty relief has to say .
however , all of that pales into insignificance when we examine yesterday 's performance .
] the hon minister of education did not know whether teachers had been deployed .
let us look at the record when questions are put to the national anc ministers .
] when we sat in cabinet and heard from reverend ...
mr speaker , the next heading is funds from increased provincial revenue and surpluses .
] he said that he was the premier of all in the province .
the hon member mr hoza can confirm that because he knows what i am talking about .
we need to understand our different backgrounds and culture , the way we do things .
i am not surprised that the hon premier did not say anything about culture .
" the speaker knows about the shopping centre that i approved in goodwood .
r9,5 billion , or 0,5 % , has been taken out of the fluidity of the economic market .
the uk , as we know , is a major source of foreign investment in south africa .
it is funny that the hon member mr ozinsky should mention p w botha .
mr speaker , this process works very well with the national minister of finance .
mr speaker , the ruling party no longer cares for the voters .
as the saying goes , power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely .
across the country , the anc won 72 % of the municipalities , ...
the majority of the coloured people in the western cape rejected them - 58 % of them !
we know about the immoral way in which the nnp and the dp were joined together .
] please , this programme was worked out last year with that chief whip 's consent ...
the western cape department of housing was the first to put a stop to that .
the hon member on that side of the house has lost all his places .
that the anc has no view for this country and for this province .
mr speaker , the hon members are laughing , because they laugh at the poor .
when they bring the people to the polls , all they want is their crosses .
they say that if one does not agree , one is " feinsteined " .
this brings me to my first worry in the opening address of the hon premier .
let that uniqueness and culture , demographics and environment unite us - not divide us .
the opposition over there , the governing party , have been in power here since 1994 .
mr speaker , the opposition is clearly in a state of confusion after the election .
mr speaker , the adjustments estimate for 2000-01 for sport and recreation is as follows .
the whites voted for them and in so doing they voted for the status quo .
mr speaker , the hon premier has also sidelined the youth in this province .
how do they expect those people to achieve what is supposed to be the objective ?
if one asks the senior officials about this , they say that that is normal .
all our great stars that grace our sportsfields come through the school sport systems .
the security of the people of the cape flats must not be politicised .
it depends on the context in which an hon member uses such a word .
mr speaker , on a further point of order : may i address you ?
i cannot recall that the da ever used such an advertisement ...
only eight out of 140 students at the vredendal secondary school passed with matriculation exemptions .
he went on to say , " a job creation audit will be carried out in rural areas ...
what we need is a more long-term strategy towards new niche products and quality .
there is so much proof of that that the hon premier has received the pmr award .
who says that the da cabinet stands accused of not having done that ?
sir , i want to talk next about the speech of the hon member mr ozinsky .
every time the hon anc members come into this house , they play the same card .
let us see what happened in the constituency of the hon member mr mckenzie .
the anc should rather let go of the race card and stop making allusions to colour .
] we will be there for them ; we will survive and we will win .
it is difficult , but we have different councils and we must integrate our idp .
one aspect that concerns me is the purpose and role of minmec .
this just does not work , and that is why the element of cooperation is something that needs to be worked on very hard .
if i am correct , they won 77 seats in the metropolitan area .
] it is interesting that she goes to worcester to do business .
mr speaker , i apologise for my absence from the house yesterday .
mr speaker , i want to extend an offer to the hon member mr mckenzie .
let me repeat that , we deliver like no other government in south africa delivers .
all other hon members had their opportunities to pick fights .
] it also reflects a flagrant disregard for the professionalism of the psychologist concerned .
it is indeed true , however , that most poverty is found in the disadvantaged communities .
mr speaker , having said that i would like to make a few comments .
the hon premier says that he believes in the african renaissance of president mbeki .
mr speaker , we must forget the new term , " the new south africa " .
talking of political will , thabo mabaso lost his eye at the guguletu police station .
mr speaker , the people of the western cape have been left in the lurch .
the iec is one of the most important institutions outlined in our constitution .
and voter registration is clearly an issue which the iec should manage , ...
she does not flinch or waver before pressure from the anc .
why is land not made available in the municipal area of blaauwberg for low-cost housing ?
people of the province are dying of hiv / aids-related diseases .
i wonder if the hon minister knows what it means to be poor .
security is needed most in the disadvantaged areas , not in the advantaged areas .
i am too proud a south african to discriminate against anyone from any province .
mr speaker , poverty alleviation can never be the sole responsibility of one ministry .
organisations such as molo songololo , st patricks , ons plek and the salesians are vast organisations .
we must do something about the migration across the borders of provinces .
in franschhoek we have had three fires in the langrug squatter camp , tjotjombeni , since october 1999 .
the voters out there have wholeheartedly supported a vote of no confidence in the coalition government .
mr speaker , they say that we ride the hobby-horse of racism all the time .
the new np does not know what is happening in the province .
] i said that to the hon premier and he will admit it .
the hon minister of health will confirm that and so will i !
they must go back to the electorate and begin to hear their heartbeat .
i want to refer hon members to the memorandum that was submitted to the city council .
the hon minister may proceed and address any matter in his speech .
what has the hon premier done to address these thorny issues ?
what price do we pay when foreign investors take their investment to greener pastures ?
among the other core areas of the western cape , the tourism infrastructure attracts tremendous growth and investment .
the recently formed business against crime organisation involves a number of projects being looked at .
some received r1 000 and others r1 000 plus a subsistence and travel allowance .
in his opening address , the hon premier referred to participation and the participation of communities .
mr frikkie muller of still bay decided to join the anc .
mr speaker , is the hon member prepared to take a friendly question ?
we cannot afford to have our people massacre one another , and that about a taxi route !
mr speaker , when we say this to one another , we tell one another ...
] you were in a position to do so five years ago .
i feel that i have raised the consciousness of my white brother in swellendam .
they are not exclusively african and coloured , but the majority are .
i do not think that is what the hon minister of education was implying .
what was that hon member doing to protect the poor in the police station ?
] what is the role of the hon minister of education in the province ?
he then says that the police are 40,44 % under strength at present in this province .
in the past four years we have only had 107 new recruits sent to this province .
hon members know that last year we trained 400 officers to the tune of r750 000 .
" i said to him : " on condition that the anc ...
coloured people and africans in particular continue to be subjected to these conditions all their lives .
] it was not - they do not know when the church service starts !
when we visit the coastal towns , we hear the same cries from the fishing communities as we did last year .
the principle of no work , no pay applies there more than in any other community .
but we are still caring for these people and that is why we will overexpend .
] so he was left in that van by that hon minister 's officials .
the following morning mr baadjies and his mother , anna , were put off the farm .
there is no mr gelderbloem in the house , but there is a mr gelderblom .
will the hon member mr fransman please give me a chance to speak .
i have a problem with the methodology , which is not conducive to job creation .
we must at least be able to hear the hon member speaking .
i will take the question when i have finished my speech , madam speaker .
meanwhile the new np is censuring its own members , in particular the hon member mr marais .
all expenditures budgeted for will be covered by revenue flows over the medium term .
estimated actual collections for the 1999-2000 financial year amounted to 5,3 % of total provincial revenue .
this has been undertaken in line with the recommendations put forward by the katz commission and the budget council .
( d ) tariff registers have been implemented within departments to provide a better data base .
mr speaker , with respect to own revenue allocations , the salient adjustments include :
medicines , health staff , temporary shelters and administrative assistance are the priority areas where we can help .
thirdly , there were poor catering facilities , and after 16 : 00 these were non-existent .
the recommendations in the report , under the heading , " introduction " , read as follows :
under the heading , " vote 3 : finance " , i quote the second paragraph :
under the heading , " vote 5 : education " , i quote the first paragraph :
i quote the first paragraph under the heading , " vote 6 : health " :
the committee notes with concern the lack of effective overloading controls .
he had better watch out for signs like that because he will be dealt with without tolerance .
this is a story that is being repeated a hundred times along the western cape coast .
now let us look at another key industry in this province - the fishing industry .
the marine living resources act , 1998 , was meant to , and i quote :
the only weapon in their arsenal is the poison-tipped arrow of racist vilification and racial scapegoating .
we question whether we have come across anything quite as infantile as that .
section 228 ( 2 ) ( b ) provides that this , and i quote again :
we are now able to gauge and weigh them and they also serve as the criteria .
the former minister of social services and poverty relief put in place a poverty relief programme .
at present they are staying at the monwabisi chalets because they have no houses here .
scof is only there to make recommendations and to ask the necessary questions .
the 5 % that we are currently generating is praiseworthy in the circumstances but totally inadequate .
mr speaker , the hon member mr lewis raised a number of important issues .
more than 100 community development projects in the most marginalised communities are being funded by this province .
because we want the people out there to know what we are doing .
they have asked for my head already , and they have asked for the cabinet 's head .
as the hon member mr isaacs said , " hulle tokkel die snaar .
this transition to the new management model is managed in a strategic and structured way .
losses suffered in the past are estimated at r10 million per year .
] madam chairperson , i think this is very important ; the anc should listen .
madam chairperson , i will withdraw that , but i refer you to hansard too .
i have already acquired a great deal of research information , which i shall elaborate on later in my speech .
still in the current financial year the desks will jointly focus on the following projects .
] madam chairperson , will that hon member allow me to finish ?
] i do not want to be nasty now , but i am going to say it nevertheless .
as a result of time limitations i can of course only focus on the most important aspects .
this includes the formulation of policy and conducting the collective bargaining process .
a substantial amount was invested to establish kromme rhee as a world-class training facility .
core support functions , such as the provincial government gazette and the gymnasium do not lend themselves to decentralisation .
these functions will therefore continue to be delivered by this directorate , together with its risk management functions .
i need to know how many disabled people form part of the hon minister 's office .
gender training in particular in all departments in the province is crucial .
draw up the youth budget to make sure that their interests are catered for .
the department that was responsible could not give us a similar breakdown .
the hon minister knows that there are ngos at her disposal that work with gender issues .
the office of the premier should play a monitoring role and have its own programme .
] the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation is part of this government .
we have the highest incidence of the socio-economic disease called tb in this province .
those are the issues we should be dealing with , and the hon premier should listen .
it balances the outcomes of policies , plans and projects on women , men and children .
when we speak about gender we must not conduct a debate with tunnel vision .
could we give the hon minister an opportunity to address the house .
they must go and do a needs analysis of what they want done in their constituencies .
all these democratic buzz-words , just to derail the process until now .
] the thing is that they are going to do it to other hon ministers as well .
i want to thank the hon member mr louis for his support for the vote .
] if that hon member wants to say something , he should ask for a turn to speak .
i thank him for doing so in the debate on my vote .
i do not make such allegations , but the people there were actually ...
i request the hon member mr fransman not to give a running commentary , if he does not mind .
mr chairperson , i would now like to come to the hon member ms brown .
i want to tell her that we do not have an agreement with austria .
so there is no national government - is that what you are saying ?
that applies to hon members on this side and that side of the house .
from what the hon member has said , i think i have a clear picture .
the committee notes with concern the lack of effective overloading controls .
it is important that all the needs of parliament have now been properly quantified .
a fresh approach by the hon premier and his cabinet , however , is highly appreciated .
an amount of r2 million included in the budget is for capital projects .
hon members will also find more user-friendly and comprehensive indexes in the next volumes .
it will also regulate parliament 's financial arrangements , subject to other legislation , of course .
you know , madam chairperson , the visitors ' gallery up there has room for 36 people .
the hon member mr king mentioned the facilities in this building .
( a ) to ensure that all provincial organs of state are accountable to it ; and
when there are debates in progress , and so on , we will make it as easy as possible for them .
it also means that members can take part in the budget debate more constructively .
the hon member mr louis referred to the marketing of the provincial parliament .
the r60 000 will be there as an extra initiative for the different committees .
i did attend a meeting at the offices of the sanp in knysna .
in terms of the constitution it is the function of the iec to register voters .
i would like to see that , because the tender board has not rejected it .
at this stage they have not yet even got up to speed outside the metropole .
food , blankets , mattresses and temporary accommodation were immediately made available to the victims of the disaster .
this compares with the present budget year ( 1999-2000 ) where the following was available :
at best we will in due course quantify the cost to the provincial government itself .
we agree absolutely with what the hon leader of the opposition said .
mr speaker , i am not aware of any delegation having taken place .
rationalisation by means of the issuing of establishments in terms of the pupil : teacher ratio .
( 1 ) no , the department does not have such a programme in place .
the province is involved in a victim empowerment programme , which forms part of the national crime prevention strategy .
therefore , with respect , the hon member ms essop is making a mountain out of a molehill .
i understand that the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism has been held up somewhere .
( 5 ) what is the table bay homemaking club and who runs it ?
applicants are upon consideration of the recommendations notified in writing of my decision .
progress reports , as well as audited financial statements , must be submitted prior to the payment of the subsidy .
mr speaker , we do not fund artscape , but we do fund the performing arts .
the original due date was 31 december 1999 for successful implementation of phase 1 .
other legal inputs have been obtained from within the province or from the office of the state attorney .
the hon member could well make use of that rule if he is dissatisfied .
provided the speaker also permits all the other questions to be asked as well ?
the cases were referred to the director of public prosecutions on 12 may 2000 .
] but i never ever hear anything in that regard from hon members !
] i presume that this is one of the delaying aspects of this matter .
( 2 ) the document was given to the chairperson of the standing committee .
i have here photographs of the house in which mr mcotshana lived .
( b ) the farm owner provided all transport for free during treatment and hospitalisation .
mr speaker , transformation is a systematic process that takes place within a statutory framework .
let me mention education as an example , where one manager has to manage 1 800 officials .
one manager to 365 officials will improve the workload and service delivery in the province .
the other point is that transformation is window-dressing if it happens too quickly .
the hon premier should read the newspapers , but he was probably in greece at the time .
fourthly , there is the long-term planning of public transport in the city .
kwazulu-natal did not say that they would deal with their problems two months down the line .
those hon members know that he is not in charge of saps .
strangely enough , those hon members will sit there and close their eyes and ears .
i want to say that the western cape is the only province to have introduced transport subsidies .
( c ) the governing bodies of the two schools applied for amalgamation .
it was running very well and performing extremely well under every criterion ...
in fact , the station there is no 4 on the provincial list for establishment .
( 4 ) whether he will make a statement on the outsourcing of property management ?
the tender is then awarded to the tenderer that scores the highest number of points .
mr speaker , why have i not been able to deliver on this time-scale ?
] they have supplied the framework , but they have not supplied the regulations .
the person in question was indeed found guilty in the regional court on 14 august 2000 .
( 3 ) whether any development programmes have been initiated at provincial level for disabled persons ?
local government - inclusion of local government in the integrated provincial disability strategy processes
we expect that the submission will serve before the cabinet on 1 november 2000 .
an hon member : " misled " is the word , not " confused " .
( a ) the municipality of darling re-employed the former town clerk as town secretary .
mr speaker , the town clerk did not receive a package on retirement .
our investigations so far have identified relatively few grade 12 learners with fraudulent reports .
western cape planning and development act : amount paid to consultants for drafting of regulations
this strategy is also included in the wced 's management plan for hiv / aids .
he was perhaps indirectly a perpetrator of what happened at mcdonald 's on saturday .
] that is the legacy that we are sorting out now .
] i believe that it is a good system and it is working out .
mr speaker , i do not want to use guesswork when answering a question .
mr speaker , i do not know the value of the contract .
no , i kicked the hon member ms essop out ; i did not kick him out .
in addition , the hon minister of health went abroad to find more affordable drugs .
a job creation audit will be carried out in rural areas for the drafting of a development policy .
during the past year we have reinforced our reputation as an efficient delivery-focused government .
i want to mention two issues regarding the western cape second adjustments appropriation bill .
mr speaker , i would like to congratulate the hon premier on his opening address today .
remarks were also expressed by the hon member mr strachan in regard to the environmental commissioner .
i thank the hon member mr silke for his comments , which are much appreciated .
the approval is sought in terms of the public finance management act , 1999 .
the committee wishes to express its concern that the amounts of roll-over funds are constantly increasing .
mr speaker , we will continue to outshine the anc here and elsewhere .
does the hon premier imply that the hon member mr mckenzie is lying with intent ?
the hon premier did withdraw that remark and he may proceed with his reply .
the anc talk about delivery ; they should know that delivery delayed is delivery denied .
mr speaker , i had a meeting with the president late last year .
mr speaker , i was accused of going to only manenberg .
that is the core of my answer to the hon leader of the opposition .
the farming and fishing communities , who are the mainstays of the area , are also threatened .
what assurances and guarantees can the hon minister give on these promises ?
once again the people of macassar are suffering and we are now talking about long-term solutions .
now , if one pump has to be serviced , there are three back-up pumps to prevent problems .
i have personally spoken to eskom about this with a view to providing an emergency generator at macassar as well .
the hon member might quite possibly have been the minister of local government at that stage !
one can offer no excuse for the sewage spillage that took place there .
as a quick-fix solution i would like to make a suggestion to the hon minister .
] yes , we will incorporate them into the police after we have trained them .
the process has , however , already commenced to phase in market-related rental tariffs .
mr speaker , i want to know from the hon minister what the formula is .
mr speaker , perhaps the hon member does not understand what the market is .
mr speaker , they are occupied by people of all colours in this province .
( 2 ) a time-frame has been compiled according to which the process will be managed .
as hon members are aware , maintenance work does not require an eia under the regulations .
the rest have to apply for permits , which is closely monitored by the district council .
i am not in the habit of having teas with judges per se .
mr speaker , we are very grateful for the fact that the cabinet is again visiting the west coast .
the anc must just carry on with its confrontation ; it will get them nowhere .
i want to assure hon members that we are doing all we can .
( 3 ) expresses the hope that similar operations will be repeated in future .
i won and i will give the hon member mr gabru the details .
when does the black and coloured affirmative action plan truly kick in ?
it is one year and three months later , and apartheid still rules from the grave .
throughout the hearings of scof we were told that there is no new procurement policy .
policies , have ensured that south africa has weathered the storm of the world economic crisis remarkably well .
only 17,9 % of people are unemployed , which is lower than the national average .
briefly , this is a task well done , and i congratulate the hon minister on it .
finance officials at training courses do not just attend seminars and workshops and receive certificates .
i hope he will apply those good principles on financial management to the gambling board .
yes , and should he also remove your names , the people who are still anc members ?
the answer is that one must accept what the hon member mr louis is saying .
i discussed it at the ncop , and then , all of a sudden , it became national .
madam chairperson , on a point of order : we did not call them thieves .
no , i will tell the hon member what i did with those allegations .
the hon member mr n m isaacs spoke about documentation which he had .
this in effect means that we are 10 000 personnel short of the ideal strength .
in real terms the department of community safety 's operational budget has increased by 44 % .
workshops were held to teach the aged to keep themselves safe and secure .
to identify and implement crime prevention initiatives in support of the national crime prevention strategies .
he started with his core functions and strategic objectives , and everything that goes with that .
it is a pity that he does not have the manpower he ought to have .
now we still have to wait for the unicity , and for whatever other cities .
in his department there is only one black staff member out of an establishment of 28 members .
of the 52 159 cases of reported rape , only 4 200 have resulted in convictions .
the basics of fighting crime simply cannot be addressed by this provincial budget .
one of the strategic objectives of the department is the launching of an investigation ...
the new np also makes a very strong plea for devolving more powers to the province .
on behalf of the people in my constituency i should like to extend a cordial welcome to him in the little karoo in advance .
mr chairperson , it is a great privilege to take part in this debate .
mr chairperson , madam seems to have a very low profile at the moment .
the western cape parliament must hear the appeal made by ms claasen and put a stop to this mess .
this is another praiseworthy project of the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation .
in this house , however , they say something else for the benefit of the people out there .
that is now being done by cpos in the main streets of cape town , as a result of this .
that is why muizenberg and diep river are 60 % undermanned , and nyanga is only 19 % .
we shall do this by organising community , summer and winter games , particularly in disadvantaged areas .
in fact , all of them have been in disadvantaged areas until now .
we shall also assist local sport forums in their endeavours to promote sport in their communities .
this will be part of developing the western cape as the sports mecca of south africa .
these achievements have formed a solid foundation for further development programmes and projects for the 2000-01 financial year .
the commission was formed on 1 september 1999 , but has only had one formal meeting .
research has shown that there is a direct correlation between a sedentary lifestyle and health problems .
during the scof meetings we heard about the programmes planned for project chrysalis .
i should like the department to initiate such a programme .
i also want to ask the department to give the whole issue of sport tourism a high priority .
i appreciate it that the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation has a plan .
the hon minister mentioned 60 today , but the gold book refers to 80 codes .
] now the request is being made that we place greater emphasis on development and infrastructure .
obviously it has to do with the fact that mr barnes is not white .
do not worry about me ; the point is that charity begins at home .
hon members do not have to be able to swim like a fish or penny heyns .
if the western cape ballroom dancing association comes to us with a budgeted proposal , we shall certainly look at it .
the hon members messrs winde and e isaacs raised the issue of the 2006 soccer bid .
i now afford the hon premier the opportunity to address the house .
mr speaker , we are ready for the knowledge economy which will characterise the 21st century !
we will write our own history book as a textbook on good , clean , efficient multiparty governance .
we have proven to be an extremely viable alternative to an otherwise anc-dominated government .
our soccer team , bafana bafana , will also show the world that they too are winners !
the western cape has been invited to attend the it congress in bavaria during june this year .
a strategic energy plan for the western cape , with the help of the upper austrian energy agency , is to be developed .
i believe that the western cape 's culture and nature-based tourism is where our future lies .
south africa in the past 100 years has had its fair share of wars , uprisings and killings .
mr speaker , this is the first reading of the first finance bill for this year .
mr speaker , on a point of order : i am totally in agreement with your ruling .
madam chairperson , firstly i would like to answer the hon leader of the opposition .
] if hon members want to take care of the taxpayers ' interests , they will listen .
if those are defective , almost all other investments will have minimal educational input .
he was writing about higher education , but his words are apt for all education institutions .
however , if we want to prepare our learners properly for the future , khanya is absolutely essential .
depending on how many documents your hackers and moles got hold of !
we ought all to cooperate with the wced in the successful implementation of this model .
mr chairperson , the next point i wish to address is the naming of schools .
the system undergoing change should be open to grappling with change in an ongoing way .
the decline of educational quality in our country heralds a crisis of inconceivable proportions .
one would expect far better results than the dismal ones alluded to earlier .
behind her stands a department and a corps of teachers that any province could be proud of .
i also want the hon minister to act in respect of these conditions .
but the measure of the success of the education system will focus on the public school system .
we need to be able to separate isolated problems that gain media publicity from our judgement of systems .
there are 69 pupils in a class in grade 9 and 55 in grade 8 .
as we all know , manenberg is a low-income ghetto area with a 70 % unemployment rate .
at least 60 % of the pupils of manenberg are raised on maintenance grants .
the school has had to endure budgetary allocation cuts and that has an impact on the service delivery .
i think that affirmative action must be applied to change the lives of our children as well .
i shall certainly look into schoonspruit secondary school and steynville primary school .
- " e " stands for " entering into partnerships with the private sector " .
- we will implement measures to attract more private paying patients to our hospitals .
the work on these small improvements in the hospitals generates work for the smaller businessman .
a public / private partnership of this kind has also been put into effect very successfully elsewhere .
already there are numerous examples of cooperation which have substantially benefited our services .
i would like to thank the hon premier , who is not here , for his support .
it is criminal that south africans are denied life-saving medication as a result of incompetence .
i wish ms khan and her team success with the charter 's launch .
measles and diarrhoeal diseases among children still carry a high prevalence and case fatality rate .
hepatitis b , acute respiratory infections and stds are also cause for great concern because of their high prevalence .
such rules can bring out the worst in stressed staff .
these policies were drawn up with the mission statement and the core functions of the department in mind .
the community took the initiative of reporting the issue to the police .
this situation has caused disillusion and greater stress to the staff .
he lived with his wife , dollie , in 12th avenue for the past 50 years .
for the whole day and night he was left lying on a stretcher at elsies river day hospital .
after all , we have concurrent powers with national government on health matters .
the budget itself , which is inadequate , reflects very little money going to actual awareness enhancement .
how are we spending our money ?
by 1997-98 there were 28 000 people working for the department of health .
we shall use the right experts , such as those who are already serving on the ministerial advice group .
i thank her for keeping hon members awake during the discussion of my budget vote .
the upgrading of two local offices into fully-fledged district offices is also envisaged .
we will have to start refocusing our resources , but i will refer to that just now .
the branch has adopted a number of strategies to address these concerns .
however , there are also certain problems within our own organisation that we are addressing at present .
the comprehensive facility for women , the saartjie baartman centre , is now entering its second year .
nicro will have an office at the facility from 1 april 2000 .
this was started in three pilot areas - atlantis , george and also in mitchells plain .
the screenprinting project , because of its nature , was much quicker to show a profit than the project in beaufort west .
at the same time there were visits to france and scotland where two children 's parliaments had already been implemented .
i do not wish to give hon members too many details at this stage .
this multipurpose-centre can either be under one roof or it can be a cluster of buildings .
the worst disaster we had , as hon members know , was the manenberg tornado disaster .
all beneficiaries of disability grants are being examined by a state medical officer .
] i hope hon members can understand this critical issue and what will happen .
after we have received the application , the people must get their money within 35 days .
there are also district transformation committees in place , comprised of members of the communities and the branch itself .
the funds were paid directly to successful applicants from the province by the independent development trust .
this office will ensure that development policies benefit low-income communities and rural agricultural development .
mr chairperson , i salute dr sutcliffe and ms petersen and her team .
it is now an integral part of the work of everyone who was involved in the partnership .
in the interpellation today all parties declared their interest in caring for the aged .
the government could appoint a cabinet committee to deal with the issues of the aged .
another matter that needs to be addressed is the running of the old-aged homes .
there was non-delivery to poverty relief , child support and improvements to the grant system .
this programme will have to be budgeted for in the 1999 / 2000 financial year .
the whole social security policy has been formulated nationally and funded at uniform levels throughout the country .
we need to give them access to funds that the banking systems will not .
the distribution of that r1,8 billion to those who are vulnerable relies on outsourcing .
there are implementation plans at this stage that must be examined , that hon members are aware of .
madam chairperson , you referred to the maintenance grant and issues to do with that , as well as the flagship projects .
yes , of course we must get money back - there is presently a claim of r56 million .
they made an urgent appeal today to change their heads of argument .
the hon minister of transport and works asked me if he could make a statement .
] as there are objections , the notice of motion will be printed on the order paper .
madam chairperson , 240 housing projects to the value of r1,45 billion have been approved to date .
four of these projects , namely those in ashton , beaufort west , tygerberg and worcester , have already been completed .
i am especially excited about the progress made with the wesbank project in oostenberg .
that cannot be met by way of the provision of formal housing opportunities .
at present the funds we receive are only sufficient to provide for ...
the housing need in the metropolitan area alone is estimated to be in excess of 230 000 units .
planning for this project is progressing well , and i hope to be able to open it formally before long .
" i want to congratulate the hon minister on this debate and his report .
there are a few things i want to point out , especially with regard to the key policy objectives .
i want to thank the hon minister for referring to the western cape provincial housing development board .
they even bought buttons from the jew to stay in his good books .
there were big differences between the departmental property register and corresponding records of the deeds office .
mr chairperson , we all knew that the discount benefit scheme was to be phased out on 31 march 1999 .
this included national land , provincial land , provincial housing development board land and municipal land .
mr chairperson , i would further like to comment on the informal housing in this province .
a society based on private profit and greed intensifies and deepens poverty , inequality and misery .
too many reports are received about projects that proceed very slowly and are half-finished .
madam chairperson , i would like to put a question to the hon member mr williams .
that makes me think of what happened at haarlem , a town in the langkloof .
madam chairperson , the release of land should be linked to overall housing needs and delivery .
in lower crossroads , for example , people were left with r5 000 to build a top structure .
if the allocation to phps is r1,5 million , i question whether that would be possible .
that is something that must be negotiated with the local authorities .
i will discuss it with the city council as soon as the provincial housing development board has made its decision .
the hon member mr dugmore is a great proponent of the unicity , is he not ?
the hon member mr dugmore refers to parow park as if it is a major scandal .
hon members know that this province started on draft legislation some time ago .
another important aspect is the labour relations act and the municipal electoral legislation .
the old municipal voters ' roll of 1995 and 1996 still has to be upgraded for every by-election .
if we want to position ourselves within a world context , we will have to look at that carefully .
i think that that is the spirit in which the entire transformation process should be tackled and approached .
they have already reached an agreement on the protection of the integrity of the municipality .
we are going to give the municipalities the opportunity to be well managed beyond 1 november .
i have already thanked the members of scof for the important role that they play .
all the parties represented in this house today are also members of weclogo .
they are prepared for the transformation process and , with us , are going full steam ahead on that road .
for the sake of the hon member mr dugmore : " we are waiting for the national government .
yes , it is a disgrace to the national government ; the hon member is actually right .
now he comes here again and says , " drop tony and take us .
mr chairperson , we want to know what the hon minister of local government is doing about it .
what is certain is that the restructuring costs are grossly underestimated in the current national budget .
there is now more than r1,6 billion in arrears across the metropole and bank balances are rapidly falling .
madam chairperson , this afternoon i want to talk to both the new np and the anc .
so 70 % of this hon minister 's budget is for salaries of his personnel .
we need to have a more direct say in the consolidated municipal infrastructure programme grants .
many things have been said in the debate already and i do not want to repeat them .
] we do feel excluded and the parties and the independents are a little demoralised about it .
i think the hon minister has a difficult task , because his own party is divided .
i understand that the hon member mr ramatlakane is going to be the assistant of the executive mayor . [ interjections .
they had to unbundle into the tygerberg , blaauwberg , the cmc and particularly south peninsula municipality .
they will , of course , always be free to ask any question in this house .
] madam chairperson , they should talk about me , and not about former ministers .
i can quote what the chairperson of the ffc said in the national parliament .
he also referred to the interim chief executive officer and to an industrial psychologist .
he spoke around me and about the dp , the coalition and the anc .
i actually checked all these percentages , and they do add up to 100 % .
the coastal zone policy for the western cape has also been coordinated with the process of formulating the national coastal management policy programme .
the national workshops for the western cape subregions were therefore also included in the provincial initiative .
specifically i wish to present a bouquet to my planning team headed by rudi ellis .
the allocation under programme 4 : local government services is r13 million , of which r9 million is personnel expenditure .
if that is the case , we should have a combined structural plan for the unicity .
the people of the whole south peninsula will be very relieved at this decision , because ...
the three members voting in favour of the application were the three anc members .
there are certain legal custodians of land that have a legal right to that land .
where i have learnt a great deal from the hon minister is in his approach to consultation .
mr chairperson , i am very grateful to be a member of the committee as well .
according to many of his speeches , the private sector attracts far more black individuals because of the salaries .
i believe he is getting there , however - slowly , one step at a time .
we must forget about the separate roles of these bodies and collapse them into one .
lastly , madam chairperson , i want to raise the issue of the provincial development act .
i think it is wise to have two separate ministers dealing with it .
i am becoming like the hon member mr ismail when he was looking for his notes .
it is still in my hands , as the responsible minister , to take the decision .
however , the department is fully aware of the necessity of integrating different development frameworks .
there is also a manual on bioregional planning , which i mentioned in my speech .
he also talked about the unconstitutionality of the new development and planning act .
is the hon member proud to continue with the land use planning ordinance ?
it will be implemented on 2 may , and i want to meet that deadline .
surely the tourist is looking for the beauty of nature , our heritage sites and the beauty of our people .
there are seven cultural facilities , which accommodated 450 groups in total during the past year .
sir , this afternoon i should like to devote my contribution to cultural matters more than to matters relating to the environment .
we have to ask ourselves : how and what do we invest in the cultural heritage of our people ?
my question today is : what do the hon minister and his department regard as popular culture ?
madam chairperson , thank you very much for the opportunity to participate in the debate .
conservation international has released a report on the most critically threatened ecosystems in the world .
does the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs realise that cultural affairs funds a melkbosstrand community police forum activity ?
madam chairperson , when one is faced with choices , decisions are often very difficult .
i know that one minister after the other has discussed this matter extensively .
madam chairperson , i want to make an appeal to the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs today .
] i agree entirely with her concerns about which cultures we address .
that the hours of sitting on thursday , 23 march 2000 , shall be : 10 : 00 to adjournment .
that hon member has often said in the house that there must be equality .
mr speaker , this has nothing to do with the house ; it has to do with the service fees .
why did it drag on for more than a year before it came to this table ?
the transport transformation unit is generally recognised as the most inclusive and advanced in the province .
these functions include the community-based access road programme , under which six roads will be constructed this year .
traffic services to a full-fledged directorate has already been approved and the director will be appointed shortly .
i want to thank the director-general for the capable way in which he is managing the entire administration .
our traffic situation in the cbd is more than critical ; we cannot wait any longer .
we would like the hon minister to continue with this in the future .
the real work - where the tyre hits the tar - is done in works .
how many of the ministers , for instance , were consulted regarding what conference facilities they wanted ?
everywhere along the roads in the parking areas these enormous horse and trailer vehicles were standing .
for poverty eradication to be treated as an add-on or on an ad hoc basis is a tragedy .
it happens that a truck is sent 60 km to fetch gravel .
mr chairperson , thank you for the opportunity to participate in this debate .
accordingly i make a friendly appeal to them to give special attention to this in the coming financial year .
i am convinced that it was such cigarette butts that have given rise to the incidence of fires .
] well , there are a number of them , but i am referring to this particular case .
madam chairperson , i am not sure if the hon minister is actually paying attention .
the hon member mr louis also referred to the maintenance of roads and legislation .
at this stage we are going to get 100 % of everything we generate in transport .
he also referred to the billboards along the roads which are a major earner of revenue .
we have received serious representations asking that we also use our bridges for advertisement purposes .
i assure hon members that we shall take no decisions without consulting them .
he also referred to the amount of r44,1 million , which is a double entry .
i will repeat the answer that i gave to the hon member mr strachan .
we need not stay in the past - 1930 is 70 years ago .
the hon member mr ismail referred to the work done by mr spence .
we would like him to have a long stay in the western cape .
i ventured to take the national minister of transport to wuppertal .
we were unable to visit wuppertal because he had to get back that evening .
the poor mr schwabe cannot do all the work he has to do .
if paragliding there can give our province worldwide recognition , then we should look at that as well .
she went on to say that she did not want to appeal for the elands bay-redelinghuys road for 21 years .
it seems to me that she will not have to appeal for it for 21 years .
i have already mentioned that we will implement the act , possibly later this year .
i also wish to convey our thanks to mr schwabe as head of the maintenance team .
the hon member ms essop was the last person who participated in the debate .
he says the information is not what the hon member ms essop has given .
if hon members wish to move a motion without notice , they always run that danger .
madam chairperson , this new phase of global development is primarily caused by two interlinked developments .
all the satellite telephone links have been turned on their back by motorola and about $ 20 billion is being burnt up .
madam chairperson , the first core area i wish to report on , is economic policy and strategy .
this will be an essential step in the formulation of our terms of reference for a policy drafting team .
the tot system is illegal , in terms of current legislation , and the law is being enforced .
sometimes the demand for use is simple , as in the case of a school or a day hospital .
the second broad question to which i referred earlier deals with processes of property management .
five of the communities are in the rural areas , namely elim , wuppertal , suurbraak , amalienstein and goedverwacht .
the other two communities are in urban areas , namely mbekweni near paarl and khayelitsha .
the focus will be on firms employing between 5 and 200 individuals .
this project will ensure a capital income as well as an income stream for the next 40 years .
he said that it was very critical that we pay urgent attention to good delivery .
i know that that will all come into the green paper , which we are hoping to see .
i want to speak about wesgro , while i am addressing the issue of identifying sector growth opportunities .
secondly , regarding public / private partnerships , one does not need a policy about these .
every time they see me , they ask : " but what is happening with your portfolio ?
i do not know how many rented properties there are , but there cannot be that many .
we are spending r19 million on special services including valuations and rent commissions , research , and so on .
the entrepreneurs and industrialists now have enough room to put their plans into operation .
the business plans that we have seen show that we are accepting these challenges .
the hon minister has called for a social compact and non-partisan approach to economic development .
as i understand it , that was an mtn initiative which the department merely linked up with .
" by the " they " is of course signified the black people , in the generic sense .
now the hon minister is going to tell me , " yes , but the people are paying for it .
alcohol abuse is the single biggest destroyer of families and causes unnatural death in the western cape .
the threat that e-commerce poses for nation states , especially in the developing world , needs to be looked at .
there are great benefits in tax incentives , but there are sometimes also great negatives about them .
throughout the world commodity prices are declining and all the economies that focus on primary industries are declining .
if he looked at the budget he would already have seen the implementation .
he made a fairly disparaging remark about my lack of recognition of carol nhlumayo .
] i do not think that that kind of disparaging remark is at all appropriate in this context .
industries that have suffered particularly heavy losses have been the wheat and barley producers in the southern cape .
in the western cape only 0,6 % of the budget finds its way to agriculture .
a task team is currently communicating the significance of the transformation to departmental staff and relevant role-players .
the team is assembling an implementation plan and investigating financial implications to be presented to cabinet .
over the past five years the commission for land claims has cost south africa approximately r75 million .
the european union gave their tobacco farmers eight years to reach these levels .
madam chairperson , i shall continue to repeat former president mandela 's statement on 25 may 1995 .
many people speak about el nio nowadays and the effect it has on agriculture .
the hon minister spoke on a very fine theme , " agriculture reaches out " .
this contribution will be matched by an equal contribution from the western cape provincial government .
while doing this exercise we should perhaps look at a retirement programme for farmers .
madam chairperson , asset fixing is an important part of the problem to be addressed .
approximately 17 million black and brown south africans have their homes in the rural areas of south africa .
today there is more access for small-scale farmers and emerging farmers to the land bank of south africa .
madam chairperson , one of these men earns r70 per week for a 50-hour working week .
i want to link up with a statement by the hon minister that agriculture reaches out to the unemployed .
agriculture should also reach out to tourism and other smaller industries on farms .
she has been working on the farm for a long time , but she has not been permanently appointed .
in the past kerneels has remarked that he knows bokkie 's father well .
i am pleased that he offered his cooperation to enable us to look after the tobacco industry .
the agriculture budget of the eastern cape is r400 million , and that of the western cape is r74 million .
therefore they should not be obsessed by the things that they would like to see .
as far as training is concerned , over the past year we have trained approximately 1 000 new farmers .
hon members can raise an objection and we will note the objection within that vote .
that is how we have to proceed , unless another arrangement has been made between the whips .
we would like to put on record our concern at the status of the supernumeraries in this province .
( 4 ) expresses its concern at the lack of involvement by the provincial government .
landscape architectural profession bill [ b18-2000 ] .
property valuers profession bill [ b20-2000 ] .
quantity surveying profession bill [ b22-2000 ] .
mr speaker , we are ready for the knowledge economy which will characterise the 21st century !
we will write our own history book as a textbook on good , clean , efficient multiparty governance .
we have proven to be an extremely viable alternative to an otherwise anc-dominated government .
our soccer team , bafana bafana , will also show the world that they too are winners !
the western cape has been invited to attend the it congress in bavaria during june this year .
a strategic energy plan for the western cape , with the help of the upper austrian energy agency , is to be developed .
i believe that the western cape 's culture and nature-based tourism is where our future lies .
south africa in the past 100 years has had its fair share of wars , uprisings and killings .
therefore , if that is threatened , the government must institute measures to protect these entrepreneurs .
we looked at the powers of the minister dealt with in section 2 .
there has been no word of hope from him in answer to their cry .
mr speaker , the new np supports the western cape road transportation act amendment bill .
i could not believe that the children of the struggle had changed so much .
i concede that over the past 51 days people have died , and i am sorry about that .
i was one of the first people to be informed when mr ganuganu was shot dead .
this is not only a situation between the taxis and the buses .
] every time he rises to his feet , he attacks the dp politically .
the newspapers would certainly have carried their names later this year when the matriculation results were published .
samuel jensel lost children ; children who certainly had their eyes on the future .
this parliament and the new np stand accused , and the new np in particular .
how can we turn the problem around - forget about the cameras and answer the question .
too many valencias , biancas and chantines have forfeited their lives .
they are the final references in all disputes , and yet we question that final reference .
that must actually be done by decent governors in the department of correctional services .
today she is dead , another victim of senseless violence on the cape flats .
yes , mr speaker , not even here in their own backyards !
over and over again it has been proved to us that the highest crime rates occur around shebeens .
is it incidental that white residential areas are largely experiencing cases of petty crime ?
the hon member mr n m isaacs uses the bible to justify the death penalty .
hon members on that side of the house know exactly how often i have been there .
i do not stoop to the level of those hon members and will not respond to that .
one could well ask : why are we only getting 180 of the 2 500 recruits ?
] please , many of the things included in the firearms act were things that i proposed .
if a murder takes place in england at the moment , 12 detectives are appointed to investigate the matter .
two days later he laid a charge , after he had already been in hospital .
how on earth can the police take the people from the scene to the hospital ?
] that hon member must not say it is not true ; it is true .
are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice by the hon member ?
this is not public knowledge in any of the provinces that the anc rule .
it is amazing coming from the hon members on that side of the house .
the hon premier 's son 's company is apparently very good at those things .
mr speaker , this side of the house will not let that process go forward .
the weekly mail states , and the hon premier should listen , and i quote :
mr speaker , where did the r2,8 million that was used for the id registration campaign go to ?
we in the western cape felt that we had to do something to expedite the registration process .
either the provincial government did not get to the bottom of the letter ...
mr speaker , it is quite clear that the national government was asking for volunteers .
before the hon member mr ismail interrupts me , i can quote from the cabinet ...
our understanding is that public servants were paid about r1 000 each for volunteering .
i was gambling with the hon gentleman with the beard at the back there ! [ laughter .
will the hon member mr silke please determine where the hon member mr lewis is voting ?
each hon member may ask three questions and then the hon minister concerned will respond .
members will have to ask questions on the actual amount of money and ministers will have to respond .
would the hon member mr ramatlakane give me the opportunity to give my ruling ?
madam chairperson , my question is directed to the hon minister of finance and development planning .
let me repeat that it does not matter how ministers respond to the questions .
madam chairperson , the hon leader of the opposition was also in a previous cabinet .
madam chairperson , could i put a third question to the hon minister of health ?
madam chairperson , it seems to me as if some people hear but they do not wish to hear .
of course we could have used that money to open many soup kitchens , ...
madam chairperson , i am asking the hon minister a question !
however , let me tell the hon member mr ozinsky what the real scandal is .
madam chairperson , let me say that i did not authorise this amount of money .
in response to his question , that r3 990 came out of a savings on staff expenditure .
questions were put to me and i just want , as a point of information , ...
i told the hon member what i would do , and i will do it .
madam chairperson , the hon minister has accused me of asking frivolous questions .
i thank the hon member mr ismail for addressing me on this matter .
we are therefore getting very close to the question of explaining and transparency in the house .
the chairperson of the iec , who came to appeal to the cabinet , confirmed that .
the department of environmental affairs motivated that there are major crises around sewerage and waste management .
at that time the hon minister already had the information about the r35 000 .
outside of speculating on the matter , did the hon minister apply his mind to the programmes in question ?
i do not know how many people were used for disaster management or were preparing for disaster management .
under the subprogramme , traffic , r5 000 was withdrawn , and from administration and management , r12 000 .
mr speaker , i wish to concur with you , i think that that would be best .
administrative changes will be made at the table to ensure compliance with the standing rules .
gangsterism is one of our pathologies which have intrigued psychologists , sociologists and criminologists for decades .
let us try and establish our bona fides that that is what we are about .
since 1994 the hon minister of housing has spent more than r1,8 billion on housing .
but the anc-controlled national government have hundreds of millions of rand lying idle in their housing budget .
the hon premier referred to those particular things on the bus scene and the bombing scene .
we would then in close cooperation with the unicity government create a two-prong approach .
we claim a lot of success for arresting 140 or 500 gang members .
this situation will receive our serious attention because it will impose further pressure on limited resources .
he mentioned the municipal police who could help in our communities .
there is a casino where , i believe , thousands of people have been employed already .
mr speaker , the provincial parliament has been opened and the hon premier 's address has once again been delivered .
i want to ask him what exactly he means by " a municipal police presence " .
it is clear that the hon premier has left himself space in his address .
] no , we heard that the second priority of the hon premier was economic development .
the hon premier said that politics is defined by the ability to deliver .
the province , due to unacceptable reasons , has not set up a rent tribunal .
do hon members think it is spurring them to be more transparent , accessible and accountable ?
i am shocked by the hon premier 's praise for the hon minister of health .
it is this reality that divides people which his government is unwilling to transform .
the reasons for this are the easy access via the coastline for drug traffickers and smugglers .
the need once again in the southern cape is reaching impossible proportions .
mr speaker , i would like to conclude by mentioning my constituency one last time .
over the past weekend rapport reported that the anc wanted to liberate the western cape by 2004 .
or does the anc want to insinuate that the people of the western cape cannot think for themselves ?
no , i cannot uphold the hon member mr dugmore 's point of order .
is that how the anc wants us to solve our problems and create job opportunities ?
organisations and individuals will be invited to nominate representatives or individuals to the council .
we demand that a proper process be followed , with clearly defined outcomes and transparent objectives .
the issue is the housing development in that community and whether or not consultation took place .
] this is not what we have been told and this is an issue .
mr speaker , i must also commend the hon premier on an excellent opening address yesterday .
mr speaker , i want to congratulate the hon premier on his well-considered and direction-giving opening address .
mr speaker , i am sorry the hon member mr fransman is not present .
if the hon member mr fransman wants to work on behalf of lawbreakers , he can do that .
those people who perpetrate this type of exploitation derive comfort from the hon premier 's silence .
mr speaker , we in south africa are not under threat of any military attacks .
we are , however , being destroyed by the greatest threat to humanity , namely the human immunal deficient virus .
i think that the anc dropped the ball in this province during the election campaign .
however , the problem is that he listens to the wrong spin doctors in his own party .
rape survivors who cannot afford azt will be treated at rape crisis centres at our hospitals .
they should accept that in africa this means rockbed prices for antiretrovirals .
but generic medicines are no substitute for research and can never be .
this is now happening through the ploughing back of this revenue into the budgets of the department .
mr speaker , i did not pay him ; the particular ministry paid him .
we are not spending only r2,650 million - we are spending the total amount .
i would like to remind hon members of what the hon member mr winde said .
mr speaker , just before i tabled the report it was corrected .
madam chairperson , could the responsible minister , and i am also not sure ...
madam chairperson , i shall certainly look at the cape argus tomorrow for a reply .
hon members should note that we are considering the schedule of the bill before us .
madam chairperson , the hon member mr dugmore has an irene grootboom in his head .
the fact of the matter is that it is not just the irene grootboom case .
( 3 ) the role played by the youth in the struggle against apartheid ; and
is this situation of violence being maintained so that we can score political points about it closer to 1 november ?
no taxi operator or industry can guarantee a licence , and there is an enormous conflict about that .
we are saying that the make-up of the local road transportation board needs to be looked at again .
however , there is no doubt that in the interests of the public ...
it was resolved long ago that the issue of public transport should be depoliticised .
the anc has always firmly taken the position that we condemn any acts of violence .
now we have come here a year later with the same issue and the time-bomb has exploded .
the figures tell us the percentages provided by all modes of transport in public transport .
the capacity of the minibus taxi industry to participate in formal contracts will be developed .
did the hon minister of education tell the hon minister of transport and works about it ?
we need an organisation that has a membership that we can hold accountable .
we in the anc will be an ally in any process to bring about peace .
mr speaker , i want to come back to the speech by the hon leader of the opposition .
i shall take the decision , but i tell hon members that that is what is happening .
the hon member mr ozinsky goes in there when he wants to do a bit of politicking .
i spoke to the national minister of transport at 13 : 00 sharp .
i cannot tell them that they have to include 50 % of the smmes .
( 3 ) these youngsters are vulnerable and often socially , emotionally and physically damaged ;
investigation into non-fulfilment of responsibilities of chairperson of standing committee on economic affairs
the first is ms carol johnson , the new director in the department of legal services .
mr speaker , the new np takes pleasure in supporting the cape town international convention company bill .
i must say , ms johnson went through that very capably and we are satisfied .
mr speaker , the new np supports the cape town international convention centre company bill wholeheartedly .
] i should like to deal with some of the misrepresentations that he uttered here .
the fact is that the auditor-general had concerns about certain aspects of the bill .
the three shareholders are the province of the western cape , the cmc and the city of cape town .
in australia the number of international meetings has more than doubled over the last eight years .
in the second convenco agreement there is a short clause on empowerment which contains simple issues .
mr speaker , that brings me to the next point , representivity on the board .
the building of a hotel is a central feature of the convention centre agreement , is it not ?
we would like clarity as to who owns the land and whether it has been finalised ?
we are getting inputs of enormous value from directors from the private sector who deal with this .
the hon member should also be very careful in what she says about the design teams .
the first point is that there are going to be no city of cape town and no cmc .
madam chairperson , i am going to read it as it would read when amended .
i will give hon members two minutes each to address me on this .
it applies to the province and the province 's role in that shareholders company .
now those hon members do not agree with me that there is national legislation .
in other words , always subject to the supremacy of parliament 's appropriation powers -
the shareholders ' agreement therefore referred to the current agreement or " any amendment or variation thereof " .
that is what makes me wonder why subsection ( 2 ) is so urgently needed .
it covered the shareholders ' agreement because the original text provided , and i quote clause 5 ( 1 ) :
i have asked the deputy secretary to check what has happened to the bill .
( b ) as being part of an additional budget passed in terms of an appropriation act .
i would like the members of the standing committee to bear me out on that .
when does the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism propose that the third reading be taken ?
first report of the standing committee on public accounts , dated 9 june 2000 , as follows :
( 1 ) media reports have appeared on juveniles who are in overcrowded prisons ;
therefore urges the speaker to distribute the idseo report on this issue to all members .
mr speaker , the bill makes provision for the various types of municipalities to which reference is made .
the deletion of that by no means implies that a municipality will not have a mayor .
mr speaker , look at our proposal ; what is wrong with our proposal ?
the hon minister could not tell us what was wrong with our proposal .
our proposed new paragraph ( e ) under category b reads , and i quote :
another has a collective executive system combined with a ward participatory system , and so on .
it is rather unfortunate that they wanted to have an executive mayor - i know that .
mr speaker , the new np supports western cape determination of types of municipalities bill .
the anc does it at the national level and the coalition does it at the provincial level .
transformation of local government started with the constitution-making process way back in 1994 .
it also flies in the face of promoting the broadening of democracy at the local government level .
in attempting to amend this bill to include the executive mayor option .
weclogo were there , inputs were made and the anc did not put in an appearance .
] those hon members must place this in perspective and try to understand what this is about .
i am afraid that we shall get another anc member as executive mayor in saron .
] this is an internal fight between the anc members as to who the mayor should be .
does it mean that members of the anc cannot be held responsible before the law ?
this is what john dugard and others have said about the apartheid era judiciary .
how is it possible to have a senior civil servant and an anc councillor in the same person ?
between criticising judgments and the judiciary , and interfering in that process .
mr speaker , those hon members continue with group mobilisation in the most outrageous way .
there are very few whites left in zimbabwe , but mugabe blames everything on the whites .
the hon minister may continue and i ask her to address the chair .
mr speaker , the problem with the anc is that it believes its own propaganda .
coloureds want delivery because they have tasted the worst poverty that apartheid could bring .
the hon minister of education 's opposition was not the size of a pea .
if she had done , she would jealously protect the right to transform .
because those hon members voted apartheid in year after year after year , the quality of life has just decreased .
] i must state very clearly that white politics is not new np politics .
] we did not try to intervene in that judgment , did we ?
it is about business and business practices , and the banks ' need to be competitive .
at the national level , a preferential procurement act prohibits what we know as " fronting " .
mr speaker , thank you very much for the opportunity to take part in the debate .
mr speaker , those people do not always have the revenue capacity to invest collateral .
and if they paid r500 to become members the benefits would be huge .
the dp issued a statement denying that the smmes had been badly treated .
this practice takes out the black smmes ; there is no empowerment for them .
mr speaker , the small business sector is by far an undervalued asset of this country .
mr speaker , maybe the anc would want to step out from behind alice 's looking glass for a moment .
the human rights commission would then choose some of the cases of discrimination for use in case studies .
bridging finance is given according to risk premiums , and blacks by definition seem to be a high risk .
let me tell hon members , there are many white smmes who have experienced it .
do hon members know that the dp now has the largest organisation of smmes in south africa ?
the next meeting of the house as such will be on tuesday , 22 august 2000 .
second report of the standing committee on public accounts , dated 10 july 2000 , as follows :
( v ) national council for library and information services bill [ b44-2000 ] .
( 1 ) the session of 23 august 2000 has been unilaterally cancelled by the coalition government ;
i gambled by answering the question of the hon member across the floor .
the last approved general property valuation within the former city of cape town area was based on the 1979 voters ' roll .
madam speaker , we are facing our first ever democratic local government elections .
because almost half the 843 municipalities in south africa are in a financial crisis .
madam speaker , it is obviously true that some municipalities are in serious financial difficulties .
the draft property rates bill threatens economic growth , particularly if a land tax is imposed on farmers .
and i use " black " in the generic sense - coloureds , africans and indians .
that is why the anc has made very clear proposals in regard to the rates issue .
did the hon member mr mckenzie hear that he also referred to airports and harbours ?
we have already had a clear indication from the anc as to their method of implementation .
recently i had to mediate so that they could get just r2 million back from that municipality .
the rates and the rates legislation are only one of the important components at issue .

i would like to cite a few relevant issues that affect the community in the southern peninsula .
mr speaker , on a point of order : the hon premier must withdraw that statement .
hon members should not make the assumption that mr wiley is not part of that commission .
] i am saying that the secretary assumed that mr wiley is not there .
i would like to spell out the background to this contention that we as the anc are posing .
very opportunistic , because at the time mr mowzer was not present at the board meeting .
fiduciary duty under the companies act and the king commission enjoins directors to do so .
at no point did the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism recuse himself .
] they are people who understand the tourism industry and are prepared to be there .
mr speaker , as i said , they do not understand what cooperative governance is .
( b ) act in any way that is inconsistent with their office , or ...
can we for one minute believe him when he says , " we will arrest them .
] yes , tell them , before they think that i am delivering a speech out of their mouths .
if we do not have evidence , we cannot blame pagad for everything wrong that is done .
if one says that the muslims are violent people , one is making a big mistake .
it can never be done by arousing fear and planting bombs .
stop the bombers ; stop the murderers ; give our children a chance ; speak clearly and unambiguously .
i also think with sympathy of those who have already lost their lives in bomb explosions .
i also wish those traumatised by those bomb explosions a speedy recovery .
and if you can not help them , would you at least not hurt them ?
[ mr m hoza : mr speaker , this house needs to debate the issue of bomb explosions .
i think that the time for such things has passed , because south africa is now liberated .
the boot is on the other foot and pagad can not stand the heat .

mr speaker , the motion of the hon member mr byneveldt covers a wide field .
mr speaker , paragraph ( 1 ) of the motion states , and i quote :
that discourse in its muscular variety under tony leon becomes aggressive , if not pernicious .
suddenly , coloureds and africans have to find each other if we are going to have a harmonious society .
] today they seem to appreciate him far more than they did while he was president .
mr speaker , i rise today as a former member of the anc , ...
let us look at the whole aids debate to which the hon minister of education referred .
the house will go into recess from friday , 22 september 2000 until monday , 2 october 2000 .

today the farm workers are awaiting the reply of the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works .
mr speaker , thank you very much for the opportunity to participate in this debate .
indeed , it is that exceptional rotten apple that we do not want with us .
however , the da acknowledges that this is not the norm and further acknowledges ...
to give up their farms for empowerment projects and economically viable land distribution to their workers .
mr speaker , i should like to know whether the hon minister would take an answer .
] the da is the only party in this province that does anything for farm workers .
third report of the standing committee on public accounts , dated 2 october 2000 , as follows :
( a ) the amount of r8 300 be authorised by the provincial parliament ; and
fourth report of the standing committee on public accounts , dated 30 october 2000 , as follows :
( c ) the legality of all transactions in this regard be determined ; and
after all , the committee stage deals with facts , and not with scoring of political points or playing the fool .
remark the hon minister of social services and poverty relief spoke against the chairperson ...
] at the same time i would have expected the demands for information to be reasonable demands .
sir , i am referring to the parliamentary process to which the hon member ms essop referred .
we have managed to reduce the amount of roll-over funds substantially from previous years .
a total amount of r83,040 million was received as further conditional allocations from national departments .
the education vote has been allocated r1,94 million for the manenberg disaster in this financial year .
] does the hon member want to know how much we received in so far as the manenberg disaster is concerned ?
that the hours of sitting on friday , 9 february 2001 shall be : 08 : 00 to adjournment .
mr speaker , one of the key aims of our organisation is to fight corruption .
] some hon members in the house have only read about poverty ; i know poverty .
the people of manenberg , guguletu , the crags in plettenberg bay and karatara know what poverty is .
do hon members really think that people from manenberg and guguletu would agree with this statement ?
[ we believe in the ancestors , and the hon member mr hoza can confirm that .
[ we venerate the graves of our forefathers and we still believe in our ancestors .
we are proud to see that departments in the province are structured and ordered .
] no , we need to encourage more people like that to come into the province .
the hon premier did not refer to the social issues , but listen to these figures .
r5,7 million is spent on cigarettes , r14 million on liquor and r1,2 million on dagga .
if this is not racism , mr speaker , please tell me what it is .
i want to repeat that - this side of the house condemns any form of racism .
it is my intention now , in the main , to deal with my other portfolios of business promotion and tourism .
only this week we had an excellent example of that in the results of the israeli election .
mr speaker , we in the western cape must embrace this very positive view of south africa .
real delivery the da way puts bread on the table , but racial solidarity ...
we will establish a clear choice and growing alternative for all south africans .
] let us compare the anc to the da , and forget about the other parties .
the hon member mr dugmore referred to the issue of the purchase of rdp houses .
mr speaker , this is presented here as if rdp houses are being sold only in the western cape .
as a rising star of the anc he does not , i think , come even close ...
in the south african context , only the province of the western cape stands out as a gem .
what we can read into the results is that our province still remains extremely racially divided .
however , cooperative governance extends to the cooperation of all the hon members of this house .
i am thinking in particular of the squatter camp in langa , called joe slovo .
i hope that other people in the da will begin to talk to their hon minister .
at arcadia high school there were five children out of 51 who passed with an exemption .
i think that is the point that the hon leader of the opposition was making .
as is clearly evident , my department is engaged in goal-directed programmes to ensure ...
they can measure the benefits they have and which are still being provided for them .
however , if one goes to durbanville and bellville and hears gunshots , that is abnormal .
i therefore commend the spin doctors of the da for misleading the people .
i have heard enough from the hon member mr king to be able to make a ruling .
] it was only through underhand deals , bribery and other strange ways ...
in ward 6 the da 's candidate took 91 % of the vote .
if that is all they can achieve with the race card , the colour card , they had better forget about it .
i wish to congratulate all the learners who passed their matric examinations in the year 2000 .
mr speaker , i want to endorse what the hon member ms brown said yesterday .
mr speaker , many thanks for the opportunity to take part in the debate .
we had a multiparty commission who were involved in the process of advising .
on the other hand we also worked with the iec in the whole registration process .
next year we must build upon this in order to put proper integrated development plans on the table .
he then proclaimed a regulation in terms of which we were able to settle the matter by lot .
i want to mention one example to hon members , and that is the allowances for councillors .
the hon member ms brown returned to a secure position in the house .
mr speaker , this afternoon i want to request our colleagues really to accept the challenge .
i thank the hon members messrs hoza and winde for their contributions in this area .
the hon minister of transport , sport and recreation undertook to look after the roads .
i thank the hon member mr n m isaacs for his contribution in this regard .
for her valued contribution , the hon member ms van zyl went looking behind the arms scandal .
i want to refer to the comments made by the hon member mr ramatlakane .
mr speaker , this outrageous response is a gross insult to harold cressy high school .
who gives the hon minister the right to speak on behalf of the jewish community ?
the two of us were colleagues at crestway senior secondary school not many years ago .
she is not fit to occupy any public position in the new south africa .
mr speaker , i rise in support of the opening speech of the hon premier .
he says that the black graduates are leaving for other provinces where they feel more welcome .
this is about to become a problem for the governing parties as local government elections gain momentum .
mr speaker , of course we must strive for a peaceful , orderly , prosperous and caring society .
we have the locus standi and the duty to perform strong economies worldwide .
we need to grow our links with these regional economies some of which already have strong national ties .
the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation acted and the transfers were stopped .
the hon minister of education recently struggled to get service at the same police station .
immediately she had the attention of the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation .
i am sure that he and other hon members have heard of dr death , wouter basson .
i think we can all go to him to learn how to tackle a policy-drafting process .
mr speaker , in his opening address the hon premier raised the matter of voter registration .
the hon member must proceed with his speech , or else i will see the next hon member .
then we have to examine good governance against the provision of social services or socially related services .
i am certain , however , that the western cape cabinet will not let these things go unattended .
" i cannot believe that we have classes of 64 children today .
however , i would like to hear what the hon member mr ozinsky has to say .
mr speaker , i will have to teach you to pronounce my surname correctly !
the hon minister of education is again dividing a school in guguletu .
tambo village is next to manenberg - they are a matter of 5 metres away from each other .
it is also not true that the coalition is working well - it is divided .
this year alone we will complete three library projects in disadvantaged areas outside the city of cape town .
let me tell him that both the hon premier and i visited langa .
mr speaker , on a point of order : is this street fight allowed in the house ?
i also proposed this initiative to the mayor of franschhoek in a recent letter .
when it comes to hiv / aids , we must walk the talk .
our country also needs treatment for hiv / aids-infected patients .
these men , like my rastafarian friend , are roaming around - poor and trying to make ends meet .
the hon member should be careful that they do not pull her up again !
] this proof of how the people outside think is very clear .
the one election that they did win they won by only 19 votes .
have they forgotten that horse chestnut broke his leg and is out of racing ?
mr speaker , the hon member is correct , because he will be participating in the debate .
where was he that night in blue downs when the new np beat him ?
] i have full confidence in those people 's integrity and what they are doing there .
in all honesty it could not have been the disadvantaged community of the western cape .
i am confident that even the constituency of the hon premier would disagree .
hon members must please allow the hon member mr winde to deliver his speech .
the attractions are such that there are already in excess of 260 foreign companies in cape town .
we still do not know why departments paid different amounts to the staff .
mr speaker , we want a commission to look into this whole issue .
mr speaker , many thanks for the opportunity take part in this debate .
i would like to return to what the hon leader of the opposition said yesterday .
mr speaker , i want to thank the hon premier for his path-breaking speech last week .
during the election campaign we will fight hard against one another , but dirty play is not required .
] then they come here , holier-than-thou , and tell us what racists we are !
i will not allow racism in this province to be swept under the carpet !
the hon members on the other side think these are all very small issues .
" he looked at me and he said , " why are you making an issue of this ?
] they emphasise racial differences when it suits them and deny them when it suits them .
mr speaker , the hon minister and the hon premier have referred to the western cape .
he does not know what is going on out in guguletu , manenberg and other areas .
the hon member may use other ways to try to quieten another member .
we see that in the national assembly they now want to limit the question time for opposition parties .
the anc is playing a dangerous game , by sowing discord , distrust ...
clearly , i think the effective treatment of stds has now become non-negotiable .
mr speaker , i have to address the expenditure in the department of health .
surely the statement that was made basically puts the coming local government elections in a negative light ?
as there is no speakers ' list there will be no debate on this order .
these are augmented by specific key deliverables assigned to each department by the cabinet .
compared to an average national figure of around 30 % , this figure is relatively low .
the mtef is intended to bring policies and objectives together in a three-year expenditure envelope .
thirdly , it contributes towards improving democratic accountability and understanding of the budget .
what it does mean , is that from the 2000-01 financial year , these grants have been discontinued .
( b ) a business manager for health must be appointed , and this process is approaching completion ;
( e ) the implementation of our revenue retention policy will gain further momentum over the mtef period .
( b ) r21 million from alienation and r2 million from rentals in the property management portfolio ;
as i have already indicated , the western cape suffers far less poverty than other provinces .
i must firstly thank the hon premier and members of the cabinet for their cooperation .
the financial statements of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1998 ;
our own people , especially those in mpumalanga and the northern province , have also suffered greatly .
( 1 ) notes the extensive flood damage in the calitzdorp-gamka valley in the little karoo ;
( 4 ) requests that everything possible be done to stabilise the situation .
the reprogramming demanded sessions from early in the morning until late at night .
under the heading , " vote 10 : economic affairs , agriculture and tourism " , the committee states :
most of this budget , not just r10 million , will be spent on poverty relief .
the concession - listen carefully - lapsed at the end of september 1998 .
mr speaker , perhaps the hon member mr ismail should watch his words more carefully .
in the report it is stated that they would provide work for some 23 000 people .
when one drives through khayelitsha and the townships , one notices how many people are unemployed .
mr speaker , i would like to say that the anc supports the budget as presented .
] i thank hon members for asking that question , because i have replied to it .
in any democratic country in the world that minister would either be sacked or would resign .
mr speaker , on one point i must agree with the hon member mr strachan .
i am aware of the procurement policy which was included when awarding the licence .
i genuinely and sincerely thank all hon members of the opposition for some of their kind words .
i accept that some of the points which they have raised need to be looked at a little more carefully .
my commitment to accountability and transparency motivated me to introduce our government to the people project .
another commitment is accountability and transparency , and that brings to me to my internal audit component .
unroadworthy buses have been scrapped and overpayments of r4,5 million are in the process of recovery .
international as well as national governmental relations are now being dealt with by the component intergovernmental relations in my office .
but i believe the expansion of the internal audit will lead to even more savings .
i must say to that hon member that i do not hear his nonsense .
madam chairperson , i am very receptive to criticism , particularly if it is constructive criticism .
] madam chairperson , i shall go so far as to spell this out categorically .
monitoring and evaluation that was initiated during the 1999-2000 financial year will be consolidated during the 2000-01 financial year .
if the hon member has a chance to respond i will answer him later .
these specialised services are in fact provincial assets that cannot be blindly decentralised .
he played an instrumental role in the drafting of our modern labour legislation and the final national constitution .
the administrative functions regarding human resource management will in due course be decentralised to the departments .
ninety projects covering the entire spectrum of the work study field are planned for the financial year .
despite this a job evaluation unit is already prepared to start this important work .
the disabled have a saying which says , " nothing about us , without us " .
other issues such as working with hiv-positive or aids-infected colleagues must be addressed .
one official will be used as a witness in four cases and possibly receive indemnity .
regarding criminal prosecution , i can mention that seven cases have been registered with the saps .
madam chairperson , i take pleasure in supporting vote 1 - premier .
the dp believes that representivity , madam chairperson , is based on a number of flawed assumptions .
make the best possible use of the training budgets that already exist in most government departments .
in the house we have received information from the hon minister that deputy directors were appointed .
we would also like see the youth desk becoming involved in programmes like the abc programme .
this means that even the departments ' other members need more education about women 's issues .
] they should draw up plans after they have consulted with whoever they have to consult with .
it focuses on women 's involvement , concerns , needs and aspirations , as well as those of men .
the hon member ms phenduka also focused on discrimination against women , which is correct .
it is just a pity that she too harped on the old issue of business plans .
i have to take hon members back to the history of this matter so that they can understand .
it is evident that the anc were never serious about youth issues or youth development then .
mr chairperson , i should like to thank hon members who participated in this debate .
the hon member mr silke also mentioned the shortage of advisors and drafting personnel .
he should ask him again , or go and read hansard , and then he will hear .
i believe that my achilles ' heel in this province and as premier is our lack of communication .
i also thank the hon member mr louis for his support on the international agreements .
if the hon member does not understand english well , i shall say it in afrikaans .
the investigation was done by mr robin douglas , former secretary to the national parliament .
i apologise if we did not brief the tenderer adequately .
if our establishment is properly enlarged , office space will become an even greater problem .
( i ) the exercise of provincial executive authority , including the implementation of legislation ; ...
to put it bluntly , the staff in those committees , the committee staff , are severely overstretched .
the hon member mr king made an appeal on behalf of the 36 former members of this parliament .
i would like to tell the smaller parties in the house that if we ...
in conclusion , the hon member mr riyahd williams referred to the competencies of committees .
the hon premier owes the citizens and taxpayers of the province an answer .
the iec can request assistance , but if they do they will do so in writing .
in the past two weeks more than 5 000 people have applied for identity documents .
( v ) we have consulted with numerous stakeholders , including wesgro and the provincial development council .
i specifically answered the question with reference to property belonging to the housing development board .
institutions are currently in possession of vacancy list 1 / 2000 , which contains posts for redeployment purposes .
mr speaker , we have had very serious problems in the past in relation to this .
the hon premier has not complied with an act passed by this parliament .
i would request the hon minister to address this matter with the tender board .
what progress has been made with the drafting of legislation regarding depositing of medical waste ?
mr speaker , i am pleased to say it is on the same subject .
( 1 ) what procedure was followed in the disbursement of transfers to cultural organisations ;
( 3 ) who is responsible for the signing of cheques for these transfers ;
the human ecology projects were training programmes in various fields such as dcoupage , silk painting , embroidery , handcraft and quilting courses , to name but a few .
i was encouraged by that , and i will be pleased to advise the hon member as to the details .
the hon minister of finance and development planning said that the implementation date was 31 july 1999 .
my calculation of six months from 31 july 1999 is the end of january 2000 .
i do not recall having said what the hon member said .
mr speaker , the tygerberg children 's choir is recognised throughout the world as one of our best children 's choirs .
we will sign an agreement of understanding when it comes to information technology , culture , agriculture and investment .
mr speaker , the situation is as follows .
mr speaker , on 23 may 2000 i provided a copy of the reply .
mr speaker , the point is the fact that we have planning legislation in this province .
the minister of community safety , sport and recreation ( on behalf of the minister of local government ) :
confusion has been created and the hon premier is included among those who have created it ! he was at the site .
( b ) training specifically aimed at the enforcement of security measures is provided .
( b ) this information is promptly available at the saps head office in pretoria .
mr speaker , china and korea are among the bigger economic role-players in the world .
however , what is more important is that with these agreements we have begun to build bridges .
mr speaker , the province , as hon members are well aware , has a forensic audit component .
the result was that , about eight months ago , mr mcotshana was hospitalised for two weeks .
( a ) the farm owner paid all medical expenses for mr mcotshana 's treatment .
the kleinvlei 24-hour emergency hospital is still not fully functional because of shortages of staff .
she tells the newspaper that there are 104 white managers , whereas we have only 87 .
mr speaker , the fact of the matter is that nothing is cast in concrete .
we must stop trying to score points here just to impress the public .
mr speaker , the first responsibility of any government is to see to the safety of its people .
last but not least i also wish to thank the hon minister of community safety .
the violence and intimidation started on 27 march this year and carried on until 3 august .
] was it the issue of powers , or did he fall off the moving wagon ?
he had not yet done so , so there could be no be legal campaign .
] the hon member mr ramatlakane said that this government was weak and indecisive .
there was unnecessary tardiness , and if that tardiness had been got rid of ...
mr speaker , it depends what the hon member mr ozinsky means by amalgamation .
hon members are also aware that the establishment of a fully-fledged station is a top priority .
it will be implemented on 2 may , and i want to meet that deadline .
mr speaker , what the hon member mr ozinsky has just said is contempt .
we are looking at a fee structure for applications to help with the capacity .
( e ) a complete soil potential and irrigation report was compiled for the project .
a procedural draft resolution may now be moved for the allocation of additional time to questions .
my question is : has the hon minister taken action to put this right ?
in the 1999-2000 financial year an amount of r75 113,22 was issued as social relief at the district offices .
in an attempt to make the task team more inclusive , i investigated alternative options .
mr speaker , what the hon member mr byneveldt is now asking me is nonsense .
whether any corrective measures have been taken regarding the payment of transport subsidies ; if so , what measures ?
i have already indicated that it is running away from their responsibility .
in november 1998 , 1,5 million km were claimed , but only 881 000 km were actually travelled .
the hon minister took those initiatives and said he would appoint a consultant .
] i do not read articles that the hon member comes up with , with inaccurate information .
( ii ) an early indication by the quantity surveyors indicated that additional money would be required .
they acted purely on legal grounds after information had been received from adv e vermaak .
second international day of disabled persons , since the establishment of the disability desk , is currently being organised .
organisations and individuals will be invited to nominate representatives or individuals to the council .
however , in so far as people organising tourism conferences is concerned , the more , the merrier .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon minister of health a follow-up question .
whether the province is adequately prepared for the matric exams and the security relating to matric question papers ?
in the same document certain recommendations regarding the possible contents of such kits are made as well .
furthermore , health advisory committees should be established by the governing bodies to advise and assist in this regard .
it is also true that very many of them took the voluntary severance package .
more importantly , mr speaker , they said it was a small group of extremists .
mr speaker , i think it is the " leader of official opposition " .
[ i would like to find out from the hon premier what the role of the poverty desk is . ]
i now afford the hon premier the opportunity to address the house .
he is 84 years old , and i am privileged that he is still my mentor .
in keeping with the request from the national health ministry we will forward all captured data to them .
the record of the department of housing and the hon minister of housing is well-known .
mr speaker , i have touched on our achievements and sounded a warning against complacency .
and , the hon member mr mckenzie has not delivered as he promised .
sanco is fast becoming the home for disaffected africanists in the anc .
] can hon members on the other side of the house give me a better reason ?
] or do they love this part of south africa so much that they all come here ?
if they ask the matrons at the hospitals they will tell them what is happening .
that is why the press are here today - they normally would not come .
do they remember the phrase from shakespeare 's play , julius caesar , " et tu , brute ?
i will refer this matter to the rules committee , where all the parties are represented , for consideration .
as no one wishes to address me , i will refer it to the rules committee for consideration .
one of the subsidence tanks is already operational in order to eliminate the capacity problem at zandvliet .
a former member of the provincial parliament , mr joe marks , also highlighted this situation .
it was never reported to be 90 megalitres in that specific area .
i am sorry to hear of a quick-fix with bricks in toilet cisterns .
mr speaker , it is a serious charge against an authority for this situation to have come about .
mr speaker , the answer to question 2 ( 1 ) comes in two parts .
the lack of accurate information from schools has been remedied by the establishment of a call centre .
mr speaker , i would like to go a little further in answering this .
] they will , in time , be integrated , because we are training them .
the council has , since november 1998 , been actively involved in enforcing the various conditions in question .
( 4 ) whether the governing body has acted within the ambit of the south african schools act ?
( 1 ) whether an environmental impact assessment has been done for the rebuilding of houses at grotto bay beach ;
mr speaker , as it so happens , my department is , in fact , meeting with the west coast district council tomorrow .
i would like to ask the hon premier what the purpose of the visit is .
they are actually telling the people of the western cape , " to the devil with you .
" they are not thinking about the people ; they just think of themselves all the time .
to answer the second part of the question , i have already done something about it .
in addition , functional financial training has been provided to 1 111 officials out of a target group of 1 500 .
i gambled with province 's money , so the winnings went to province .
madam chairperson , this is quite a serious matter and i do not wish to be frivolous .
in this respect we should ensure the effective management of provincial debtors by 31 march 2002 .
it is envisaged that a debt collector will be appointed to assist in this task .
there is also an opportunity cost , including the delays in the implementation of this tender .
it cannot just be handled with " noting concern " .
madam chairperson , in this regard we in this province need to raise moneys and create jobs .
madam chairperson , i now wish to turn to some more micro issues of this vote .
it is about fiscal and financial control and devolution of powers to all the departments .
the reality is that the small business people have not appropriately benefited from government initiatives and contracts .
we need to have an assurance from the hon minister of finance and development planning in that regard .
a company sent out circulars , asking for people in certain spheres of employment .
first of all , i cannot resist the temptation and have to speak on the gambling industry .
when he picks up a document , he looks to see if it incorporates the red policy .
i sat on the plane for 17 hours coming back from america recently ...
once again he has used the tactic of challenging the chairperson of the gambling board .
foreign investors want stability of government and safety for themselves in the areas they invest in .
the truth of the statement of mr oppenheimer is that all these factors are dependent on each other .
for the information of the hon member mr dugmore , total commitment also includes political commitment .
at a recent planning seminar commissioner selebi indicated that he would recruit 2 500 police officers this year .
comm crafford was the supreme commander of operations in the western cape , of which operation good hope is one .
however , we must be careful to understand that the successful joint operations are intelligence-driven operations .
the primary gatherers of this information are officers attached at station level , specifically patrolling officers .
regrettably the current shortages and strategy strip our capacity for effective community policing , even more so now .
the aaa project achieved amazing results in terms of community involvement during the course of this last year .
alison also visited the school that valencia attended and addressed over 700 pupils there .
i wish to thank them all for their efforts , more particularly the area boards for their coordination .
madam chairperson , the manenberg madam forum was recently established and has now been adopted at national level .
we have traffic law enforcement agencies , we have local authority law enforcement agencies , and everybody seems to be operating on his own steam .
now i understand the remark by mr tony leon about breathing new life into a dead horse .
the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation said that he lacked the powers .
let me single out a few points in the hope that we shall be able to attend to them .
the point is that we must have these projects in operation in the metropole as well .
my request is that we give serious attention to it and focus on it .
we have had all of this but , increasingly , ordinary south africans are simply saying , " we have had enough !
referring to this department specifically , we are pleased that the community patrol officer scheme is finally bearing fruit .
we look forward to the entire deployment of the 770 by the end of the year .
overwork and long hours often also have a negative psychological effect on the policemen and women .
it is true that in some communities where socio-economic problems are being experienced , there is a lack of visible policing .
after his retirement he is going to the best place in the western cape - oudtshoorn .
my colleague spoke of the liaison of the saps with the department of social services .
perhaps i did not believe that such an initiative could come from a mark wiley .
we must also convey our sincere thanks to commissioner crafford and thank him .
the powers and functions that the police have today are what was agreed to by the new np .
with respect to the hon member mr ozinsky , it is my turn to reply .
according to the hon member mr mckenzie , we are supposed to make this an apolitical debate .
as the hon member well knows , the department of justice is totally underfunded at the moment .
i thank the hon members messrs gelderblom , louis and williams for their kind words of praise .
madam chairperson , i am afraid this speech is even longer than the previous one .
these facilities are based outside the cape metropole , where the need for development is the greatest .
these conceptual changes require amendments to the relevant legislation and that will take some time .
] they are the backbone of the sport in south africa on which our international success is based .
it sometimes seems as if some hon members on that side cannot take it at all .
sport tourism can also be utilised as a mechanism for job creation and economic growth in the province .
what would the benefits be of including that in our regionalisation or twinning ?
why did they as the np not leave this in the hands of the communities ?
that paternalistic attitude is again coming to the fore , namely that brown and black people can do nothing .
the same applies to international sport events , an issue raised by the hon member mr louis .
the hon member mr winde talked about the funding of organisations such as western cape ballroom dancing .
madam chairperson , i know it is very boring and it is late in the afternoon .
we have specific funding criteria ; 50 % of the funds we receive have to go towards development .
madam chairperson , unless anybody else wants to ask a question , i am just about done .
the lion 's share , 88 % of our total budget , was allocated to health , education and social welfare .
in france i addressed 300 delegates from 26 states of the assembly of european regions .
it is one of our specific tasks to address the causes of crime .
for the following three years amounts of r15 million , r25 million and r35 million have been allocated .
i reiterate : no mercy for offenders and for taxi drivers who infringe the law .
i believe that in the field of traffic management we must evaluate international standards , impose them and uphold them .
those hon members will be asked to deliver a speech , so they should listen carefully .
allen drury wrote the book a very strange society referring to the south african apartheid society .
the point is that the hon member should listen and not speak so much .
bills received from national parliament and tabled by the speaker in terms of rule 191 :
it is a ministerial visit , but everybody knows that the dp delivers to the poor .
madam chairperson , these success factors , which also provide the guidelines for our budget , are the following .
madam chairperson , these six factors are all taken for granted in our good public schools .
this was one of the first high risk schools identified by our safe schools programme last year .
we regard an appropriate national examination at the end of grade 9 as being particularly important .
mr chairperson , our third priority and critical success factor is a focus on key areas of the curriculum .
in the area of curriculum it is also essential to focus on textbook provision .
we have budgeted some r66 million for learner support materials in ordinary public schools for the coming year .
mr keith loynes deserves a special mention for the exceptional work he is doing in this field .
trade union and organisational affiliations and other non-educational criteria should be irrelevant in these decisions .
i had planned to address them now , but i await the questions with eagerness .
call to mind the dangers of family fragmentation , child abuse , drug abuse , violence and aids which assail our youth every day .
for this purpose occupational schools are being extended by at least a further four occupational schools .
of the 250 secondary schools , 62 find themselves in the same group , and this is very worrying .
in his whole career , he hardly ever had a failure in maths or science .
madam chairperson , to begin with i wish to congratulate the hon minister of education on her 2000-01 budget .
a new curriculum has been introduced and is already in grades 1 , 2 , 3 and 7 .
it seems as if schools are graded on matric results and not looked at holistically .
habiba never had the opportunity to do music , art , drama , and so forth .
i want to thank the hon member ms mqulwana for her contribution and her many other contributions .
but , we lost 8 000 teachers in this province in three years owing to national government policies .
these purchases will impact positively on almost every department and discipline in these hospitals .
the specialist areas for day surgery at both the tygerberg and groote schuur hospitals have been totally overhauled .
i want to thank dr sutcliffe for the work he does as head of two branches .
the nac excludes top south african experts in the field as well as leading hiv / aids ngos .
i want to conclude with some clarifications concerning the proposed research institute for malaria .
most specialists in hospitals use this money for essential equipment such as machinery , printers and stock .
kwakhona , ukwamkelwa kwabantu kwizibhedlele zoqeqesho nge-2,1 % - kwizibhedlele zengingqi nge 4,4 % ; kwizibhedlela zenqila nge-4,41 % .
- intersectoral work to promote and ensure effective rehabilitation services within educational , welfare and labour sectors .
] i congratulate dr sutcliffe on the very positive way they are taking this year .
some of this attention is given in clinics and some at secondary and tertiary hospitals .
yet we have academic hospitals where there is no exposure whatsoever of interns to trauma management .
of course the hon minister has mentioned the very important matter of outsourcing at hospitals .
we on this side of the house have always maintained that outsourcing is important .
he voted again in 1995 and 1999 , but he died without hope and poor .
an amount of r8 million has been allocated to home-based care and r28,7 million to our primary school nutrition programme .
why must the children in crches starve because all the food is consumed at primary schools ?
they are too depressed by their own situation to be impressed by ours .
he said , for example , and i quote from hansard : province of the western cape , vol 3 , p 314 :
he went on to speak about coming to the house with an own revenue incentive framework .
we praise tygerberg hospital , but we do not act against groote schuur hospital .
they are overworked and understaffed , but the health facilities board bill is coming .
i think it was introduced when the hon leader of the opposition was still the minister .
we know that it is because of policy decisions taken by previous administrations that we are in this trouble .
when the kaizer family foundation gave awards to health journalists , ansu thom received the prize .
i want to refer to the vision of this branch to create a self-reliant society .
it makes the branch a purchaser of services instead of a subsidiser of services .
i also want to refer to one example in the north west part of the province , the clanwilliam area .
there are just more than 600 awaiting-trial youths under the age of 18 in prisons .
the western cape provincial tender board awarded the tender for social security grants to all pay western cape .
even the whole concept of desks was introduced into the western cape government by myself and my staff .
my ministry - and this applies to all the desks - is interested in measurable results .
mr chairperson , it is the poorest of the poor who suffer when these delays occur .
alcohol abuse , intermarital abuse , crime and many other factors are causing an alarming increase in street children .
i think it is not good enough that we just place these children back into welfare organisations .
a comprehensive data bank of services and resources in the field of disability will be established ...
the former national minister of welfare and population development was responsible for the phasing out of the maintenance grant .
for her sake i could indicate that there are " focal units " in a number of departments .
the hon member mr winde referred to street children and the successes achieved there .
the swift action of the provincial ministers of transport and works and of agriculture ...
by expressing appreciation , the hon member mr gelderblom is giving a motivation for his motion .
one feels - and you will agree with me - like part of the furniture .
in all , 2 618 family units and 682 single units have been completed to date under this programme .
we are proud to have a person of his calibre chairing our board .
the western cape housing development act , 1999 ( act 6 of 1999 ) , was promulgated on 1 january 2000 .
guidelines have also been laid down for the transfer of flats from the provincial housing development board to local authorities .
a tremendous problem constantly confronting local authorities is the acquisition of suitable land for housing development .
both the national and provincial housing legislation emphasise the need for capacity building of local and provincial housing functionaries .
since the sica establishment is now in place , the post can be advertised as a permanent post .
i am delighted that quite a number of local authorities are already incorporating savings plans or microloans in their housing programmes .
as a result , beneficiaries may dispose of their properties in any manner they see fit .
the national home builders registration council is formulating a tripartite ageement with both the provincial housing development board and the department of housing .
madam chairperson , in my budget speech last year i announced that i was going to ...
madam chairperson , i now wish to address you in my capacity as leader of the house .
i wish to refer you to rule 43 , which provides that members may not converse aloud .
our debates are televised every day on channel 81 , and the people out there are watching .
] i would like to wish everybody involved in the project the best of luck in this prestigious competition .
i did not expect , however , that we would have an integrated waiting list that kept structures aside .
they play on it constantly , and if that string breaks , we are going to find ourselves sitting with problems .
this morning the anc and the new np unanimously agreed on the amendment of section 96 .
there are more than 300 000 families in our province who are not adequately housed .
this is a victory for our people who very often are at the mercy of town treasurers .
he only considers land belonging to the provincial housing development board which has been zoned for residential purposes .
these people do not have the jobs to make the life in these homes sustainable .
i am sure that is the case in the officials ' bay as well and , i have no doubt , in the gallery .
i can mention the towncon project in khayelitsha town 3 , village 3 , where r3,3 million has been put in .
the end product is a house of 62 m  at a total cost of r14 184,04 .
let me tell the hon member mr dugmore this . he knows it is now election time .
hon members are allowed to heckle in this house , but they have to do it quickly .
in 48 of these cases i issued certain instructions and recommendations to the local authorities .
the money we allocated varied between r250 000 and more or less r500 000 .
here i wish to touch upon another matter that has been entrusted to me , namely medical waste .
in addition , there was a working session with weclogo 's constitutional and legal task group , and with various local authorities .
whenever i go to local authorities i try to emphasise the aspect of a service delivery ethos .
in this municipal systems bill there is a specific section that will refer to performance management within local government .
we have already held a working session with all interested parties in local government and in the province .
i must immediately add , however , that registration does not cease on 31 march 2000 .
i therefore wish to welcome the initiatives regarding the bar-coded id documents , and also the related registration process .
they did , though , identify certain capacity problems in some category b municipalities , that is our local municipalities .
there are many people who are asking how many of the officials will be dismissed in the transfer process .
in certain areas , for example in the metropolitan area , up to seven councils will be dissolved .
is it the city clerk of tygerberg or cape town , or the city clerk of the cmc or who ?
this will have to be opposed in terms of the constitution and other acts of parliament that are applicable .
getting the transformation and demarcation processes established and accepted is not an easy task .
show me a department and i shall tell you who the minister is .
amongst others , it will deal with rates , the general valuation of rateable property , valuation criteria and valuation rolls .
he does not even know what the auditor-general wrote about local government in his report .
if they do support the writing off of the rental arrears , how do they intend to implement it ?
they did not use so much as half a cent of the gambling funds to help the poor people .
i challenge the hon minister of local government , if he did look at that report , ...
and if this master plan fails , as it may , must this province pick up the pieces thereafter ?
municipalities can no longer sustain non-paying communities , and tough action must be taken against service payment boycotters .
i note the fractious nature of the executive committee meetings that are hardly conducive to good governance .
neither is the extent to which the municipality has embarked upon the transformation of its management a common denominator .
i stand to be corrected , but if my figures are correct , there has been a drastic reduction .
] those hon members must look for the solution and not create another problem .
on behalf of the acdp i want to congratulate the hon minister of local government on his wide-ranging speech .
as the hon member mr silke has said , one out of five municipalities has financial problems .
" is it not perhaps the case that gerald morkel actually voted for the dp ?
that is why those poor whites are now coming to the anc , because they want service delivery .
i do not think we can have any doubt that we must have it by june 2000 .
] i do not want to become involved in the debate regarding the executive mayor .
interim service delivery mechanisms , as they put it , were put in place to render services .
we have non-payment in many municipalities , but certain municipalities have tackled it , and tackled it well .
- i mean that from the heart - and i include the dp .
the positive point with which he concluded his speech was that the unicity was not the ideal .
the following changes have been made to the membership of committees with effect from 13 march 2000 , viz :
the next matter is the establishment and coordination of a sound information system amongst all provincial departments .
under the racially discriminatory laws of the land , mainly black and coloured people were dispossessed of their land rights .
i found the presentation document most helpful , and i would once again like to thank the hon minister .
the transformation process means that town clerks must now administer areas about which they know relatively little .
i want to make it clear that i am using racial categorisation for purposes of statistics and description .
once again , women are in stereotypical job categories , and i think that needs to be fundamentally addressed .
they have been very gracious throughout the process , and they spent many hours with us .
the hon minister said today that he was reviewing the decision , based on technicalities .
i am sure that the hon member is dying to know who moved this motion .
that is what i want to point out to the hon member mr ozinsky too .
i certainly undertake to meet the hon member , because i think it is important .
i have already said in this house that the act is not cast in concrete .
for purposes of convenience , i shall first deal with the environmental affairs component of my ministry and then with cultural affairs .
they will actively engage the private sector in developing the tourism potential of the reserves .
in addition , there is r6,5 million in the works budget for capital schemes which will enhance tourist facilities .
library services go hand in hand with education and the availability of tangible resources to underprivileged communities .
we shall , for example , ask the cape coons to become involved in anti-aids activities at their performances .
madam chairperson , i want to congratulate the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs on his budget speech .
more than 270 youth groups and more than 27 000 people made use of these facilities .
education programmes should be researched and drawn up for specific target groups .
this involves the defining of programme objectives , using the most effective techniques and programmes .
this flies in the face of what is happening to other hon dp ministers .
library services go hand in hand with education and the availability of tangible resources to underprivileged communities .
in that way one can get into prison and gain access to a library .
statistics show that between 1997 and 1998 aids infections among south african teenage girls soared by 65 % .
i believe that unesco 's programme on biosphere training and the funds available are so critical .
this brings me to the harbours in this province - proclaimed harbours as well as unproclaimed harbours .
i see that in the business plan of the national department they are proposing that harbours be privatised .
it is a pity the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation is not here .
why is the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation 's department not funding that activity ?
if they would only sit and listen to what the other speakers have to say during the debates .
i was abroad with the orchestra and that hon minister was the acting minister of environmental affairs .
i wrote a very strongly worded letter to the cmc today , demanding a response .
we value public participation and input in respect of any recommendations that come to the department .
i now come to the hon member ms essop , my favourite hon member in the opposite benches .
( b ) the representation of the coalition parties in the house include black south africans ; and
however , they cannot do so as a result of the arrear debt caused by the anc .
the hon minister has indicated that there are amendments to be effected in the committee stage .
the department of transport has been driving the public transport planning process in both the metropolitan and rural areas .
in regard to traffic safety management , road traffic management is being coordinated by new management structures at the provincial , regional and local levels .
these structures result in greater interaction among the various traffic authorities and other functional areas in regard to traffic safety .
this brings the department into line with the way in which claims are processed in the private sector .
i was pleased to hear about the strategic development programmes that now form part of transport .
madam chairperson , once again i want to thank the hon minister of transport and works .
the lack of resources for the department in the area of job creation and poverty alleviation speaks volumes .
the hon premier spelt this out during his address at the opening of the provincial parliament .
the dp is committed to defending the privileges of the former white ruling class .
they asked : " when are we going to see more projects coming to our areas ?
the hon minister has given us an indication of how he will deal with this matter .
we are only waiting for the regulations to be passed so that we can build toll-roads .
this is the constituency of the hon minister as well and he will know of a few cases .
are the officials obliged to ensure that a certain percentage does go to the target group ?
madam chairperson , the last point i want to make is the issue of the west coast road .
i see on page 5 of the hon minister 's budget speech he discussed joint undertakings .
the main revenue of this area comes from agriculture , inter alia deciduous fruits and flowers .
mr chairperson , every year during the debate on this vote i speak about the elands bay-redelinghuys road .
what does it not cost the state to carry out their projects in this way !
in order to counteract overspending , the west coast district council is cutting down on road signs and line painting .
i see that the department hopes to generate in excess of r3 million from special number-plates .
we thank him because on the occasion of the recent floods in the little karoo , he reacted immediately .
those officials have no sensitivity , especially toward coloured working-class community schools .
the commitment of the hon minister and his department is to empower small and medium enterprises .
i use the term " black " in the inclusive sense - coloured , indian and african .
the hon member mr louis went on to discuss traffic and public transport in the central city .
the chapmans peak road is 77 years old , as i mentioned on a previous occasion .
mr van heerden is still organising some paintings for the office .
hon members should allow the hon minister of transport and works to finish his reply .
it is money entrusted to us by health to carry out certain maintenance work for them .
in the previous financial year r79 million was taken from the departments of transport and of works .
i wish to state clearly that money for this purpose was taken from his department .
i know that at one stage he also made an appeal to the hon member mr ramatlakane .
we do work for the departments of the western cape - education , environmental and cultural affairs , and health .
every school that has been built in this province has created work for small , medium and micro-enterprises .
i made a submission to the national minister in cooperation with the cape metropolitan council .
the hon member ms rossouw and i recently drove over the dasklip pass on a saturday afternoon .
she also spoke about paragliding and said that the dasklip pass was extremely well-suited to competitions .
as soon as we have the regulations and the policy document finalised , we will attend to those things .
accordingly i cannot rule any member out of order who wishes to move a motion .
i call upon all members to clear it with the whips in advance if possible .
constant development of new products is necessary , as products are becoming obsolete at a still faster rate .
generally our companies use modern management practices and approaches , and also labour practices and subcontractors .
madam chairperson , the knowledge economy is not only challenging companies , but also governments .
from such a vantage point , they have to play both a leadership and a supportive role to local enterprise .
the supply side deals with our tourist attractions and how they are presented to meet the demand .
since then we have been engaged in establishing a policy and management framework for the component .
this is the first comprehensive manual in south africa for entrepreneurs who wish to begin a tourist industry .
the mac will largely be funded by dti and foreign donors .
as they say , " i do not try to plough with another man 's heifer .
property management is to compile a comprehensive fixed property register for the western cape provincial government .
in conclusion , i would like to deal with a few individual property issues that are certainly in the public interest .
firstly , we have identified 12 properties that must be made available to the peninsula national park .
where sectors are identified , we must be proactive and say which ones we are going to grow .
i want to tell the hon minister that i have a problem in principle regarding support for wesgro .
the other thing was the export development centre for the province in cooperation with the chamber of commerce .
we owe them many thanks for the enormous task they are performing in that department .
i should like to know how far we are with the implementation of some of those recommendations .
there is an increased demand for higher skilled labour and a reduced demand for unskilled labour .
one should register those that should be registered in terms of the act , and close down the others .
madam chairperson , on the free port which i think the hon member mr silke ...
madam chairperson , it gives me pleasure to enter this debate today .
it is only through the licensing of these establishments that the authorities will be able to enforce control .
as i have already indicated , they will certainly not welcome emerging entrepreneurs in their ranks .
the comment on fibre optics by the hon member mr louis is absolutely critical .
i now come to tax incentives and the comments the hon member made on taxation .
one finds that if tax only applies for a particular period , investors go jurisdiction hopping .
i discussed this with wesgro when i became a minister about three years ago .
at that stage they were already engaged in this , and they are now very strongly established , in order to reinforce the links .
one of the negatives is the incredibly disruptive impact it has on domestic economies .
last night , when i drove home , there were 14 prostitutes waiting for me !
madam chairperson , i now turn to the contribution by the hon member mr r williams .
] indeed , they have become the proponents of a new form of hate speech in this province .
the veterinary services budget provides r8,3 million for animal health services and r3,5 million for veterinary laboratory services .
madam chairperson , the poultry industry is having a very hard time of it owing to the dumping of cheap chicken from elsewhere .
mr chairperson , there are no longer incentives for farmers to become more export-oriented .
one example of this is mutton from australia , beef carcasses from argentina and frozen chickens from the usa .
huge job losses of 40 % in the agricultural labour sector show that the limit has now been reached .
one way we can do that is through the net income stabilisation account ( nisa ) .
the building costs for the farmer 's account amount to between r90 000 and r100 000 per unit .
therefore the five-year plan of the department of agriculture ignores gender equality totally and in that way it strengthens such discrimination .
in the provincial framework the objective refers on page 171 to the " whole community " .
in other words , the hon anc members are not listening and do not look at what is really happening ?
yesterday during the transport debate i referred to the extremely poor condition of rural roads .
madam chairperson , over the past two seasons agriculture in the western cape has changed radically .
the farmer there has scaled down to such an extent that there is hardly any stock industry left .
in a radius of 50 km 10 farms have been sold over the past two years .
it is true that the red wine has now stabilised , but some farmers in this province are still planting stein grapes .
some of the wages of these men work out to a minimum of r120 and r150 per week .
i regard agriculture as the job creating body , or the lifeline , that must prevent job losses at the moment .
i am asking the hon minister to place this issue high on the agenda of minmec .
when they attend an agricultural college or university , they already have basic tuition in agriculture .
at least he could look after her - a roof over her head was important .
madam chairperson , i wish to thank all the hon members who participated in the debate .
madam chairperson , it is true that things are not going well with land reform in south africa .
madam chairperson , new farmers are not " add-on 's " in our policy .
has she ever complained to her factory owner in the city about the accommodation of his people ?
or is she not concerned when they live in a squatter hut or under the bridge ?
finally , madam chairperson , i want to respond to the speech by the hon member mr byneveldt .
that story about bokkie and janneman reminded me of a bedtime story for children .
we will also accept their making a three-minute declaration on their objection .
madam chairperson , we would like make a declaration of vote in regard to vote 8 , programme 5 .
bills received from national parliament and tabled by the speaker in terms of rule 208 :
the lion 's share , 88 % of our total budget , was allocated to health , education and social welfare .
in france i addressed 300 delegates from 26 states of the assembly of european regions .
it is one of our specific tasks to address the causes of crime .
for the following three years amounts of r15 million , r25 million and r35 million have been allocated .
i reiterate : no mercy for offenders and for taxi drivers who infringe the law .
i believe that in the field of traffic management we must evaluate international standards , impose them and uphold them .
allen drury wrote the book a very strange society referring to the south african apartheid society .
i will deal with notices of motion and motions without notice in this way in future .
bus services that have contractual agreements with the national department of transport are particularly hard hit .
i thank them for the positive discussions i have been able to hold with them in this regard .
i differ a little with what the hon minister of transport and works has said .
we are thus inserting the amendment , which consists of clauses 30a and 30b , after section 30 .
this is an emergency measure which rectifies a severe shortcoming in the road transport act of 1977 .
sir , the whole matter underlines the importance of a legal framework within which the taxi industry must operate .
why has the local road transportation board remained fundamentally untransformed in regard to its composition and its functioning ?
it is a pity that the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation is not here .
it was then essential to have provisions capable of containing the violence in those provinces .
i want to thank the hon member mr ramatlakane for the positive contribution he made .
he added that the cape peninsula was the second biggest urbanised complex in the country .
i am grateful for the support i have received from the hon member mr dugmore .
i appeal to hon members to think in particular about the last few minutes of their lives .
the hiring of gang members such as peaches to murder certain apartheid opponents is part of that heritage .
the standpoint of the anc on firearms is clear , and for everyone to read .
] what we say is that part of the plan must be strong and sound firearm control measures .
i agree with him that the criminal justice system is failing the people of south africa .
why has the hon premier been silent ever since this upsurge in violence started ?
dark alleys , unused open spaces , dark broken-down staircases - these are the children 's playgrounds .
she has not uttered a single word on the deaths of any of these children .
then they start painting it differently , and say , " it is apartheid !
i have learnt from confidential sources that there is such a dispute between police and justice .
i am very grateful that this year the police service will put 2 500 recruits in the field .
the hon member mr byneveldt quoted selectively from correspondence i conducted with him .
bills received from national parliament and tabled by the speaker in terms of rule 208 :
( vii ) portfolio committee amendments to national house of traditional leaders amendment bill [ b15a-2000 ] .
mr speaker , on a point of order : this morning the standing committee had a discussion on this subject .
mr speaker , the background which gave rise to this initial unauthorised expenditure is very interesting .
at the national level , if the anc had done this , it would have been called an abuse of power .
] firstly , they spent money on this registration process and they are authorising the expenditure .
mr speaker , we were faced with this dilemma because of a disastrously managed registration campaign .
my question in the standing committee was : how did sport and recreation spend r120 on voter registration ?
that is a very ingenious argument which the director-general has developed in order to support his contention .
if they find anything illegal , they should stand up in the house and do something about it .
let us use only 430 persons and let us not register people at all .
the other issue is that each hon member has an opportunity to ask three questions .
the way in which ministers respond to the various votes and questions is entirely up to them .
madam chairperson , i am not going to speak on procedures but a point of clarity .
a minister who takes over from another minister should check on all the issues involved .
they cannot tell us who incurred the expenditure , when it was incurred ...
madam chairperson , on a point of order : i think the hon premier is absolutely correct .
i would like hon members to apply their minds to the subject matter in hand .
the hon minister of housing has told us that he does not have the figures .
madam chairperson , the figures are available , but i do not have the figures with me now .
how does he disaggregate his vote as a contribution to that total global figure of voters registered ?
we are not busy with the vote of the hon minister of finance and development planning .
madam chairperson , the hon minister of health seems to understand and follow the process .
madam chairperson , in terms of schedule 1 i do not know what the average amount was .
i call upon the hon member to support the proposal since he now has the information .
madam chairperson , let me give the hon member ms essop a lesson in accounting .
madam chairperson , on a point of order : can you not use your discretion now ?
no , i would like the hon member to lead into his question immediately please .
madam chairperson , i would like to put my first question to the hon minister of education .
madam chairperson , i would like to ask the hon minister of education the following question .
madam chairperson , the hon member mr ramatlakane knew what we could say to one another .
by then already the hon premier knew that he was going to save r4 000 before the adjustment appropriation .
now we want the details from the hon minister because it is right now .
in terms of the amount of r3 795 i will check whether that money is being reimbursed .
madam chairperson , i want to ask the hon minister of health when the reimbursement will take place .
i will give a full answer to the house and to the hon member ms essop .
madam chairperson , i would like to ask the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs the following .
] the fact of the matter is i do not necessarily take their word for it .
there is no proof and it is the assertion of the hon member ms essop .
can i ask hon members to please address themselves to the figure on the schedule ?
the next order of the day cannot be disposed of today , if the first order of the day is not disposed of .
it therefore remains on the order paper for tomorrow , when the house can proceed with the business .
as the people in san francisco and uganda have learnt , the real cure lies in prevention .
they are drawn to good , clean and non-corrupt government which the da delivers in this province .
last year 15 % of the national housing budget , amounting to r457 million was not spent .
" i agree ; we want to move on , but we need to deal with the realities on the ground .
there is a xhosa saying , " it is not the end of the world .
on this banner is written : " western cape the most dangerous province to live in owing to a high crime rate .
we must have monitoring cameras installed in guguletu , as well as in khayelitsha , bishop lavis and elsies river .
certain resources have been made available , which have given us guidance in regard to the terror and the bombs .
they want their children to undergo training so that they can achieve the highest rungs .
next , mr speaker , i want to congratulate the hon premier on the initiative of local development .
a commitment which they made to provide shelter for the irene grootboom community .
is it because cape town is now under da rule that the hon premier is suddenly embracing this principle ?
mr speaker , the anc is and remains the largest political party in this provincial parliament .
it is this reality that the hon premier is praising and does not see fault with .
mr speaker , let me warn the hon premier and give him some advice .
matters are made worse by the harsh coastline , which makes it a difficult area to police .
the hon premier can count on me when it comes to putting shoulder to the wheel .
they do not want to go to a school and say , " i do not have the money .
why did the hon member mr rasool not see his way clear to accepting that challenge ?
the first group of people who occur to me are the farm workers and a large percentage of ...
the hon leader of the opposition was quoted as saying that and he did not repudiate it .
mr speaker , i have here the report to which the hon member mr dugmore referred .
] if a person works and is prepared to work on a piece work basis ...
after this process a decision would be made regarding the future of mtct in this country .
the promotion of the empowerment of women and young people is as crucial an issue .
the consultation process in connection with housing development in that community was started by the rdp in 1997 .
a number of the commentators who express these concerns are not friends of the da .
last year there were 804 attacks on farms countrywide in which 110 people lost their lives .
the western cape province is sending a clear message to the agriculturists that we are concerned about farm murders .
will this plan stop people from leaving , if the attacks on farm owners and workers continue ?
will they stop people leaving by ignoring the request to declare the southern cape a drought disaster area ?
mr jonker had not even appeared in court when the anc ...
people do not need to be incited against naked injustice such as this .
mr speaker , in the recent election the reward in this province was very great .
furthermore , the arrogant way in which anc ministers responded to criticism came at the wrong time .
they must come to grips with the realities of the african continent , where the disease is raging .
on monday i had the privilege of attending a stage performance of secrets and lies .
must they continue to suffer because the department cannot draw up a priority list ?
meetings have already been held and decisions have been made on how we are going to take the matter further .
mr speaker , i would like to mention as a matter of interest something which appeared in the cape times .
he said : " what did the anc do , when they were running the cape town city council ?
madam chairperson , the advice was taken from the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works .
he will have noticed that in the house earlier today i referred to the gang strategy .
i think i mentioned them earlier today , beyond manenberg , mitchells plain and those sorts of areas .
one now has three identified gang groupings fighting , quite frankly , for prostitution rackets , drug rackets and so on .
so that should give hon members a rough idea of what the thinking is .
it is an organisation that was created and there is r5,3 million in the cameras .
madam chairperson , the hon member mr ozinsky is calling me a mec .
indeed , they want it to be withdrawn while they carry on with demands and threats .
however , mr speaker , we must bear in mind the background from which this conflict emerged .
mr speaker , there are things going on here that we must really discuss with great honesty .
the hon member mr isaacs has just said that he is not referring to any hon member .
mr speaker , i have a feeling that this violence will continue in the other areas .
what codeta and cata are doing is underwriting a licence to these taxis .
secondly , now that the national land transport transitional bill will be implemented later this month , we call for -
the normalisation of public transport requires particular action from the hon minister of transport and works .
on their clipcards they can get to school from various destinations for r30 a week .
this is not a drama ; this is life - it is a reality .
mr speaker , with respect , the hon member has said it is not true .
mr speaker , they are as bad at parliamentary procedure as they are at governance .
we saw immediate statements of condemnation when lives were unfortunately and unacceptably lost in zimbabwe .
if more people are going to die , they will die with the consent of hon members of the house .
i said that we would enlarge the membership of the lrtb from six to nine .
no one will go in there - neither a bus , nor a taxi , a delivery vehicle , a municipal bus or a school bus .
we are currently approving 14 contracts so that the advertisements can be placed .
as there are no other matters , we will move on to interpellation 1 on the question paper .
the preferred bid company was announced in september 1999 and , as hon members know , it is sunwest .
the second part of the decision-making that was cardinal had to do with the appointment of the operator .
the intention is to issue one or possibly two hotel concessions on the premises .
more recently , kpmg was requested to review the inputs and provide an independent assessment .
the pre-eminent position that cape town enjoys provides it with a new impetus to become a world-class city .
mr chairperson , the cape town international convention centre company bill is fully supported by us .
this is an exceptional first project between the provincial government , the metropolitan government and the private sector .
mr speaker , i would like to give a minute example of what fine print does to us .
i would suggest that this be done in the spirit of cooperative governance .
to begin with , sir , i wish to thank the hon member mr n m isaacs for his support .
he seems to be in deep conversation with another hon member right now .
i spoke to conference-goers who were here in february for the alumni conference of the harvard business school .
mr speaker , the hon member ms essop raised a number of issues which i gladly reply to .
mr speaker , we covered clause 5 ( 2 ) exhaustively in the standing committee .
however , the shareholders are not going to be the same as the current shareholders as in the december agreement .
what this clause does is bind the province 's directors to promote this .
madam chairperson , the hon minister has stated exactly what we want to achieve through this clause .
that would not be a good enough reason to say that we would not finance convenco .
however , no formal amendment to clause 5 ( 1 ) was put on the table .
i think we should continue with the other clauses and deal with this clause when he returns .
we will now revert to the original cape town international convention centre company bill [ b9-2000 ] .
( a ) as being part of an annual budget passed in terms of an appropriation act , or
bills received from national parliament and tabled by the speaker in terms of rule 208 :
( i ) select committee amendments to south african council for educators bill [ b26a-2000 ] .
( vi ) select committee amendments to administrative adjudication of road traffic offences amendment bill [ b31a-2000 ] .
in reply to a submission the treasury indicated that the expenditure should be regarded as unauthorised .
( 3 ) space is currently available in industrial schools , which are supposed to be transformed ;
i refer hon members to these four types of municipalities that are broadly defined in the bill .
we cannot devote any further time to this ; therefore , the hon member should take his turn to speak .
that is once again not true ; he did not discuss it with the anc .
they have promised one another posts , and what is the hon minister of local government doing now ?
] he comes and tells lies about the standing committee ; he tells lies about the caucus .
municipalities are the smallest government bodies in any country and are therefore regarded as the cornerstone ...
local government is represented in the ncop , thus giving it recognition in national decision-making .
mr speaker , i take pleasure in reacting to some of the aspects mentioned by hon members .
do hon members know how the anc complained here because they were excluded from the cabinet ?
] that is a tragic situation , and i must tell them that .
mr speaker , it is outrageous that we have to see this kind of behaviour in this house .
the hon member mr r williams has just entered the chamber , and i wish to give a ruling .
i can only term the little i have heard here as " the death-rattle of reason " .
sir , i can state unequivocally that the anc scrupulously respects the independence of the judiciary .
in order for me to move forward i need to remind myself of the past , the history of south africa .
the accused was found guilty by the regional court and the case was handed over to judge foxcroft .
when judge foxcroft excuses rape when it happens within a family - according to him - surely ...
when we spoke about those things , that hon member was a member of the president 's council .
the truth , mr speaker , is that the sell-by date of this motion has long gone by .
] all the anc 's policies are based on the politics of the 1970s and 1980s .
he has no monopoly on morality and he has nothing to stand up ...
the great spin doctor of the new np tried to assert that we were " vry " -ing with them .
van zyl slabbert then said that perhaps it was because tony leon was more aggressive .
if the dp and tony leon want to define themselves outside of that nation , let them do so .
] they also come here today and say that pre-1994 everything worked well ...
they do not want to do anything to restore the quality of life of poor people .
they do not , because all they want to do is yap , yap , yap .
the only person who it affected to some extent was the hon leader of the opposition .
if we cannot share and promote those principles then the new np has a problem .
the new np stands for the people of the western cape and for the people of south africa .
] i believe that the hon minister of transport and works is back in the house .
this is because 60 % of the khula funding , it has been said , has gone to white businesses .
mr speaker , black businesses are forced into joint ventures with white companies .
small , medium and micro businesses play a major role in terms of job creation , generation of income and outcomes growth .
khula enterprise finance launched the new cape private equity fund in may this year .
mr speaker , what is the real world for the smmes , more especially in the construction sector ?
his application was rejected on the grounds that a house in guguletu had no value .
it is unfair , unjust and unjustifiable for black business to be seen as high-risk .
out of a panel of 80 panel-beaters , santam bank now has 12 black panel-beaters listed on their panel .
a series of managers also came to us and complained about promotion patterns and labour relations in banks .
yesterday we made contact with business people in mitchell 's plain who want a similar meeting .
it does not have eurocentric management ; it has black management at the national level .
that is the approach that my colleague the hon member mr marais started on in poverty relief .
we are prepared to take larger risks than the banks are currently taking .
bills received from national parliament and tabled by the speaker in terms of rule 208 :
bills received from national parliament and tabled by the speaker in terms of rule 208 :
that when she visits the southern cape , the national minister for agriculture and land affairs , in regard to the answer ...
madam speaker , we know that at that time the city council of cape town was controlled by the dp .
we are again having elections in november and now their slogan is " rates gevaar " .
many property owners have experienced a dramatic increase in rates over the last few years .
madam speaker , many ratepayers believe that they are simply not getting value for money .
if farmers pass on the extra costs , higher food prices would inflict further suffering on the poor .
] when the dp and the np were governing local governments , what did they do then ?
setting out the different categories of property which municipalities may use in determining differentiated rates .
i encourage all the political parties to do this by 4 october 2000 .
yes , there has been nothing about this specific piece of legislation in minmec over the past 18 months .
we all realise there is a lack of one coherent integrated valuation roll in the metropolitan area .
if that were to happen , we would probably wait five years for a decent valuation .
madam speaker , a very interesting point emerged in the published bill .
some services must be stopped , but no , they are now simply shifting everything onto the tax base .
this is not a problem that has not already been addressed over the past three years .
why does the anc not see to it that decent services are supplied in the city of tygerberg ?
if a female is present , she is usually raped , according to a nicoc status report of 1997 , p 4 .
it was encouraging to note that that portfolio committee was well disposed to the case put forward by agri sa .
the western cape has got off fairly lightly - and that is really a very relative term .
there are various safety measures that can be taken to enhance security on farms and smallholdings .
after the hon minister had broken the silence today , i understood why he was so quiet .
a dictionary exercise will not change the reality experienced by the people on our farms .
the hon member mr byneveldt swung this debate around and attacked farmers in the province .
bills received from national parliament and tabled by the speaker in terms of rule 208 :
( 2 ) calls for the reintroduction of the death penalty for murderers and rapists ; and
however the chair now requests the hon minister to withdraw the remark unconditionally .
i also ask the service officers to check the devices at the empty benches .
mr speaker , it is at this point that the cover-up from the new np begins .
however , this was another ploy by the new np to forget about the issue .
sorry - here 's my application to have it approved ' and nothing will happen .
this has resulted in the task team not being able to meet since the end of june .
mr speaker , i support what the hon member mr ozinsky said in his speech .
we need to ask ourselves : what game is the new np playing with the ratepayers of that area ?
since then i have been trying to get it so that i can give it to the committee .
the fact that i lived in the south peninsula for 50 years is fine .
the task team that started this work will be the people who will apply here .
" member " , as defined by that particular act , means parent , spouse , companion or dependent child .
the hon minister of community safety is a lawyer , and i seriously question his legal abilities .
] it is not the baby of the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism .
i am proud that eminent people in the private sector have been involved , people who understand conventions .
we have asked that the executive ethics code , which the hon minister has read from , be applied .
i want to put a few pertinent questions to the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism .
the hon premier should not fire the hon minister but keep him in his post .
if an hon member is referred to in a respectable way , it will be acceptable .
mr mowzer could have said , " mr chairperson , i am sorry i am late .
look at the boards of old mutual , anglo american , de beers , nail or any other company .
i repeat : i pointed out a company which had hotel and leisure interests .
the hon member should try to ask me a question in the proper manner .
mr speaker , finally , i want to reiterate that i welcome any investigation by the public protector .
the following changes have been made to the membership of committees with effect from 4 september 2000 , viz :
mr speaker , i should like to refer to what is being said about the evaluation of security information .
if they say that they know pagad is the culprit , then they should already have infiltrated pagad .
at the end of the day it is wrong to attribute the blame to pagad .
he quoted from the koran to show that muslims cannot be accused .
the hon leader of the opposition should be quiet , because all of a sudden gaddafi 's hands are clean .
the future of our children is at stake - that is the basis of this debate .
the ongoing refusal of the national government to speak to pagad is cause for concern .
what they do not want from us is a sense of discord , distrust and aimlessness .
in short , our people need to trust us at a time when they feel most vulnerable .
let us use the term " black african " to make it clear for them .
but the way in which the national government and anc-controlled provinces are applying affirmative action is equally unacceptable .
i do not want to say that it is necessarily a pernicious mind that is trying to deny it .
here was the opportunity to state what the da thought about race and racism .
i was an unwitting or witting party to the crime that was done to our people .
one gets jersey cows that give very nice milk , and what is the colour of a jersey cow ?
we really cannot chop off a cow 's head because its colour does not suit us !
( c ) the high incidence of abuse of farm labourers which is on the increase ; and
section 31 ( 2 ) specifically stipulates the adjustments which such a budget may provide .
the anc played a role there and helped the police to arrest those people .
but i want to withdraw it because i want the house to support the motion .
they tackle problems together and seek solutions in an effort to achieve success together in agriculture .
farm violence is part of a wave of criminal activity happening in the country at large .
the da knows that in the past there have been gross negligence , exploitation and abuse of farm workers .
the relationship between farm worker and farmer is not as the anc makes it out to be .
a more positive stance by the anc towards this sector of employment opportunity would definitely reap rewards .
i want to inform hon members about the following facts and provide a short character sketch of farm people .
i should like to know whether mrs winnie madikizela mandela is still a member of the anc .
i want to welcome our leaders , and also their leaders , who are once again back in south africa .
the complainant withdrew his charge , and those hon members are behaving as if this is common practice .
these are misleading and dishonourable tactics that cast unjust suspicion on the good work of agriculturalists .
the following changes have been made to the membership of committees with effect from 1 october 2000 , viz :
the committee further recommends that due consideration be given to the following during the audit :
( section 20 ( 1 ) ( a ) ) b ) effect of the appropriation .
( section 18 ( c ) ) c ) total anticipated financial implications to the provinces .
that the house wishes mr c m dugmore all the best for his forthcoming wedding .
mr speaker , it is important that parliamentary proceedings are conducted in a democratic but orderly fashion .
] i must first just have clarity from the hon member mr fransman what this is about .
i find that in order ; i cannot rule against the hon member .
an hon member : or whether you are doing your job or not ?
the balance of the total amount of r13,3 million will be provided in the coming financial year .
( c ) support the national government in its efforts to provide cheaper drugs .
[ let me also wish hon members of the house a happy and prosperous new year .
the anc is the only organisation that believes in a true non-racial and non-sexist democratic south africa .
] that is why we have established institutions like the public protector to fight corruption .
unfortunately , the hon member mr hoza is not doing what he is supposed to be doing .
the hon member ms mqulwana spoke about the fact that the province is still divided .
we are also grateful for the office that we are establishing at the european union .
mr speaker , i would like to focus my speech in this debate on three critical issues .
i greeted him and he said , " i actually do not want to greet you .
] in the free state , north west , mpumalanga and northern province we control over 90 % .
gender , by the way , is a portfolio , as my colleague has said , which falls under the hon premier .
we commend the department of economic affairs on their achievements , some of which have been listed .
much of what is done in this province by the da will deepen those inequalities .
mr speaker , it is not my function to reply to this debate .
i have offered my cooperation to a number of hon members on that side of the house .
mr speaker , this virus needs an antidote and the voters of south africa know this .
the western cape must issue fairness , innovation , opportunity and service excellence and delivery to all its people .
mr speaker , fortunately we are not immune to the antidote i have outlined .
let us forget about them at the moment and talk about the nnp and the anc .
] fifty-eight per cent of coloureds did not vote in the past election .
their day is going to come , because they cannot grow further - they can only lose .
] the hon premier made it clear yesterday that the da was against corruption .
what has happened about the issue in the south peninsula that we raised here last year ?
that is why i know , word for word , what happened at their lekgotla in citrusdal .
mr speaker , i want to tell that hon member what was discussed in their caucus .
rather than sit and make a noise like the hon member mr dugmore ...
mr speaker , on a point of order : we are not laughing at the poor .
mr speaker , the sarafina scandal was nothing compared with the question marks surrounding the arms scandal .
at local level , the da towns in the western cape have flourished and great success has been achieved .
those unfortunate towns ruled by the anc have been characterised by deterioration , disaster and corruption .
that was glen adams , the mec ; i would now like to introduce glen adams , the minister .
at modderdam high school there was not a single child who passed with an exemption .
i would like him to accept the challenge that this house does something about manenberg .
mr speaker , those are three areas that we as a provincial parliament can look at .
with this in mind , my department has allocated r250 000 in the first adjustments estimate to sports facilities .
if this trend continues it will have a disastrous effect on the economy of the western cape .
i can see that the anc has conferred , because one and all are talking about the race card .
he lives in that area - and i want the spin doctor to take note .
] do not run away and do not run to the national government all the time .
the people will realise that that party is taking them for a ride and using them as election fodder .
fortunately it was not necessary for us in the western cape to implement the lot system .
i must also inform the house that the anc members were not happy with the situation .
mr speaker , i spoke to them about that , and fortunately they came to their senses .
it was enjoyable to hear a contribution from the hon member mr redcliffe again .
examples are plentiful , and i will say more about this in the debate on my budget vote .
the hon minister of transport , sport and recreation also referred to sports facilities in rural areas .
the hon member mr byneveldt made cutting and ill-considered remarks about my integrity as premier .
that is why i called on the opposition to support the delivery train .
] but i am not going to deign to engage him in a debate about this .
the western cape government delivers better pass rates and better management of schools than any other province in south africa ;
] can the hon minister explain to us what she finds so appalling about muslim learners ?
he wants me to say , in public , that herzlia would welcome any muslim child .
however , i am very interested to know what the hon premier is going to do about it .
secondly , we agree with the hon premier that our aged are among our greatest assets .
eyes red from weeping ; eyes in which tears well up unceasingly and with painful regularity , are fixed upon him .
a fresh tear rolls down the cheek as the hon premier speaks .
i assure hon members on that side of the house that my heart goes out to them .
mr speaker , the white paper on an integrated disability strategy states , and i quote :
mr speaker , there is a request that the man repeat what he said .
we all know that the unemployment figure is in the vicinity of 35 % to 40 % .
already we find thousands of matriculants roaming the streets , trying to find work .
after the tornado in august last year the hon premier visited manenberg and surrey estate .
the 30 000 people involved in the recent cape minstrel carnival will testify to this .
madam speaker , i wish to highlight the following omissions in the opening address of the hon premier .
madam speaker , the next point i would like to address is the issue of women .
mr speaker , i wish to join my predecessors in congratulating the hon premier on his opening address .
fourthly , to be effective and efficient our message of prevention should be repetitive .
mr speaker , we in the provincial parliament should also walk the talk .
no , they are asking what is happening in the anc branches ; that is what they are asking .
mr speaker , it is no problem ; we know the hon minister is like that .
] this cabinet went to the southern cape and talked about the future of that community .
] then they go on , and this is precisely in line with the anc 's election theme :
] i regard that person 's integrity as above the suspicion imputed to it today .
] we have two or three members of staff coordinating the giving of the money from cape town .
mr speaker , i just want to appeal to our local authorities and the media .
hon members must allow the hon member mr stali to continue with his speech .
what hope , other than lamenting , is the hon premier giving the people of the province ?
only disadvantaged communities , in which the provincial government is not interested , are experiencing these criminal elements at school .
development efforts by the provincial government focus on growth stimulation in about a dozen promising clusters .
madam speaker , this cabinet is guilty of writing blank cheques for an election campaign .
some , like the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs , said that they could only speculate .
] i would go into an alliance with anybody if it was the wish of my party .
] he has chosen where he wants to be and i have chosen where i want to be .
mr speaker , the year lies ahead of us , as does an election .
] that is why they defend convicted criminals such as kidnappers and alleged murderers on their election list .
" individuals and their ethics and morality are irrelevant to the anc ; the organisation supersedes all .
having said that , ms pandor said that urban terror was the most important issue .
may i add that none of those police stations happens to be in a black area .
i want to tell a very interesting story , because it reflects the true nature of the anc .
unfortunately it is increasingly our experience that the anc does not tolerate opposition of any kind .
the lunch might have been at 12 : 00 , but the road was closed from 09 : 00 .
we must learn to push our bitterness , which still wells up so often , into the background .
the hon member ms vantura said that this province was a government of losers .
since 1994 we have lost more than 1 million jobs in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors .
] a deep-sea fisherman cannot go to the unemployment commissioner and apply for unemployment benefits .
at the plettenberg bay day hospital 32 % of the patients we treat come from the eastern cape .
the average number of patients seen in the community health services organisation is going up on a monthly basis .
madam speaker , i am grateful for the opportunity to take part in this debate .
] hon members must please allow the hon member mr silke to make his speech .
] valencia is now a statistic of a government failing its people .
this is unacceptable and clearly is an indictment upon the so-called poverty-relief from that side .
let us do something constructive for our farm workers , and stop descending into complaints sessions .
as a result of esta there are far fewer farm workers on farms today than five years ago .
today , however , i have heard nothing here about people suffering in the drought-afflicted areas .
in october 1999 , the hon premier addressed president mbeki on precisely this matter in the ncop .
" they first said that this information would be kept in the office of party loyalists .
he knows it , and that is why he did not tell that hon minister about it .
all they want is to use your leaders just as they are using them .
madam speaker , i will have much more to say on this in my budget speech later this month .
to prepare the people of the western cape for the knowledge economy of the 21st century .
in the health sector , too , hospital workloads have risen sharply , placing a heavier burden on health professionals .
mr speaker , i cannot emphasise too strongly this province 's commitment to community safety .
of this , salaries and related costs account for 55 % and grants , transfers and subsidies account for 26 % .
this province , mr speaker , can be exceedingly grateful to have a large number of highly competent officials .
in terms of rule 165 ( 3 ) the secretary will read the bill a first time .
the recommendations under the heading , " vote 2 : provincial parliament " , read , and i quote :
i quote the recommendation under the heading , " affirmative action and employment equity act " :
mr speaker , the hon minister in the office of the premier left the committee meeting .
are we not providing for entire communities through the efficient and timeous payment of welfare grants ?
he might find himself at the receiving end of a charge of intimidation by a certain minister !
i put it to the house today that gambling and toll-roads do not generate revenue .
if we deduct 14 % from the r20 trillion , our gdp will work out to r280 billion .
moreover , it is not about safety and security , but about business confidence , tourism confidence and economic confidence .
i will be asking hon members to support the appointment of the commission of inquiry tomorrow .
when they are waiting outside the committee room they are worried about what is going to happen to them inside .
it has come to be seen as the only rational way to order our finances in this country .
in 1995-95 there was a search for a regional office for the education department in mitchells plain .
as far as the hon member ms essop is concerned , i hope i do not quote out of context .
i am absolutely surprised that there is no mention of voter registration in the scof report at all .
i will send to the hon member the actual extract from the bid with regard to that .
already 220 cases have been investigated over the past 30 months , about 50 % of which have been completed .
increased focus on intergovernmental relations , especially internationally , can generate more financial aid and investment for this province .
i shall talk more about standards and poor in a moment because it deserves comment .
i have said it before , and i say it again , i believe it is utter balderdash .
the 2000-01 budget is r456 million less and in the year 2002-03 it will be r561 million less .
all of us who are not members of the anc also have the right to claim that reserve .
this appeal is especially aimed at people who find themselves in leadership or other influential positions .
our youth need to be able to look up to their leaders , to respect their views , their behaviour .
the tremendous growth in the field of information technology has redefined the entire landscape of poverty .
during this financial year the departments will be further rationalised in an ongoing effort to achieve efficient public administration .
madam chairperson , finally i have to mention that the management and staff of the branch : corporate services have committed themselves to further increase their already high standard of service delivery .
it is an absolute necessity for the development and the integration in a society for all .
the systematic gender discrimination and harassment in the economic , social and domestic arena also undermines their security .
madam chairperson , what is the hon minister doing about the ongoing violence against women and children ?
last friday night at the paarl police station i spoke to one of the lady inspectors on duty .
even here , in our departments , hiv / aids does not seem to enjoy a high priority .
i am now pleading again for it to become one of the line items at departmental management meetings .
training should be targeted at those who genuinely wish to improve their skills levels and chances of promotion .
the initiative must come from the employee and not centrally located monitors or demographic policemen .
finally , madam chairperson , i empathise with the internal audit unit , also under this vote .
madam chairperson , i would like to compliment the department in general on sound financial management .
madam chairperson , i regard it a privilege to take part in this debate .
if they are sector-driven , it will be known where the focus is in the interprovincial relations .
it is not only about the hon premier , but about his leadership and the government .
it was requested in scof in order to see how the r1,6515 million was going to be spent .
i am trying to say that we must help her every day , but when we come up with ...
] we are drawing up a programme for her , and she must please work on that programme .
i am now telling the government of the hon minister to do something about it as well .
there are a whole range of ngos , such as churches and welfare organisations , that have already dealt with these matters .
and it is interesting that the hon minister of finance and development planning raised this as well .
mr chairperson , i do not understand why there has been no virulent protest from the dp .
the hon member asked how many people are employed in my office who are disabled .
that is a programme for recruiting people with disabilities , and they are working on that basis .
if the hon minister could address the chair there would perhaps be some order .
i would also like to thank you , mr chairperson , for your constructive and positive contribution .
the bottom line is that the anc realised that they could not hijack the process .
since as far back as 1994 , more than five years ago , we have been standing here and talking about transformation .
mr chairperson , i want to thank both my hon ministers for their contribution in this debate .
those hon members cannot think , so they should not even talk about thinking !
the anc 's biggest constituency in 1994 got their identity documents and photographs for free .
then the hon member mr dugmore and a couple of mayors got up and wanted to ask questions .
the province of carinthia , which has an arrangement with the mpumalanga government , is where jrg haider is .
] we want to say , regarding this matter , that there is the hansard report , there is television ...
bills received from national parliament and tabled by the speaker in terms of rule 208 :
division of revenue bill [ b 8-2000 ] .
division of revenue bill [ b 8b-2000 ] .
i can only assume that she associates an excellent report with the excellence of the man .
the recommendations of this report are that 11 posts should be filled in the parliamentary administration .
consequently this commitment of empowerment must be reflected in the provincial budget and in this vote .
we will therefore definitely determine how we can make the former members feel welcome here .
the hon member mr winde pointed out a few aspects where we are falling short .
the initial purpose of that rule was to regulate the administration of the different committees .
we are living in a democracy in which parliament also wants to oversee the financial regime .
all members of the public should have equal access to the service they are entitled to .
the hon member mr mckenzie should feel free to talk to the other ministers in the other provinces .
two of those photographs are coming here so that they can be administered by this administration .
housing is for land held in ownership by the provincial housing board .
mr speaker , the hon member mr dugmore has answered himself by referring to asset management .
in future we will not be talking about blaauwberg , the southern peninsula , helderberg , oostenberg and tygerberg .
( 3 ) whether the revolving system is both operational and effective in public works contracts ?
the rule is that when there is a vacancy of any sort , the vacancy is advertised .
theft cases over a value of r10 000 are referred to the state attorney .
in fact , it has taken the hon premier nine months to table the report .
i am very disappointed that the hon minister of finance and development planning has defended this issue .
we cannot pass judgment on whether the hon minister was held up somewhere unexpectedly .
( e ) ( i ) mrs m m isaacs ( ii ) mr v white
mr speaker , the hon minister of finance and development planning did not answer me directly .
who made the final decision round this representation of the public sector on the tender board ?
applications for transfer payments exceeding r250 000 were submitted to cabinet for approval in terms of a cabinet resolution .
( i ) the cape philharmonic orchestra - r1,2 million over the period of one year ;
( 3 ) what progress has been made with regard to litigation and the successful consortium ;
( 5 ) the his contract is the subject of continuous scrutiny and monitoring by the provincial treasury committee .
( 2 ) why has a footbridge not been constructed a year ago as a safety promotion initiative ;
mr speaker , i want to know the following from the hon minister of transport and works .
mr speaker , throughout the year the office of the premier receives several requests from choirs .
as the hon member rightly said , things of this kind have not been budgeted for .
on a number of occasions i have allowed choirs to hold their functions free of charge at leeuwenhof .
with reference to the requests by schools and other places , we should introduce a premier 's fund once again .
secondly , i should like to ask the hon minister what he thinks about this issue .
then a lot of policemen and women could be utilised to tackle the bus drivers .
the minister of community safety , sport and recreation ( on behalf of the minister of finance and development planning ) :
if he would rather that i tabled it , i will do so .
as was noted in the answer that i originally gave , this is another sphere of government .
the residents of the houses on the specific beach were not consulted in taking this decision .
( 1 ) the submission was prepared by officials of the branch : business promotion , property management and tourism .
therefore , his submission , as minister , became the official submission to the ncop , which is unacceptable .
small-scale farming in china is one of the industries that keeps the economy going there .
i wish to inform him that mr mcotshana died as a result of painful open wounds .
he was linked to various disputes on and about the farm and neglected himself badly .
during that period the owner provided mr mcotshana with food and a wage every week .
( f ) all the houses on the farm have electricity , running water and a dry sewerage system .
i have already said that i do not approve of brutal behaviour , wherever it might take place .
when i drive down long street in the evening , i also see people lying in the street .
the hon member ms essop must show me where that is stated in the report .
hon members will be aware that one person has already been convicted in the cape high court .
] i want to say to the anc that i thought they had a hand in this .
for more than three months this has been going on , with no attention given to the matter .
they have now once again announced that it will be launched on 1 september 2000 .
we do not even know whether the legislation has been signed , because there are legal problems with it .
it costs a tremendous amount of money to keep a school open for 12 learners .
we go to the community and set up a forum in every small community .
could the hon minister very briefly indicate what irregularities delayed the presentation of that report .
( a ) - ( c ) yes , we have received scoping reports and environmental impact assessments for approval .
what was the other part of the question put by the hon member mr ozinsky ?
i support similar projects where disadvantaged communities accept responsibility for and take ownership of their own development .
( d ) economic feasibility analysis and cash flow projection for grape / vegetable projects were done by the agricultural economist .
( d ) we have continued to reduce staff to meet budget constraints .
fortunately , the incidence of hiv has not gone up as predicted in my 100-day speech .
mr speaker , an administrative oversight is precisely what it means - an administrative oversight .
( 4 ) policy is being compiled in terms of which properties must be managed within the province .
mr speaker , i thank the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works for his reply .
mr speaker , i am prepared to give them to the hon member mr louis .
mr speaker , the public transport function was devolved to the provinces between 1996 and 1997 .
the hon minister 's response was that there was no corruption - everything was fine .
was the hon minister , in giving answers earlier on , aware of this practice or not ?
does it mean that the hon minister has now confirmed that he knows something about the matter ?
this means that the difference claimed is in the order of about r70 million .
the current preferential procurement policy caters for contracts of less than r2 million in specific industries .
] the hon member will get a chance to ask questions and answer them .
community service for pharmacists is due to begin in january 2001 and 45 posts will be coming to the pawc .
it is being attended to , but in some instances we do have some problems in regard to that issue .
in 1973 , when i was a founding member of that union , i still participated actively in rugby .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the house whether they heard have the following quotation :
that is why some members of the public thought that the western cape tourism board was involved .
the person handing out the paper inadvertently handed three learners paper ii .
there is no one in our province whose concerns are not my concerns .
the ministry for community safety will continue to combat crime in this province with heightened dedication .
our third priority is to fight hiv / aids with every means at our disposal .
at these sites nevirapine will be used to prevent the mother-to-child transmission of hiv / aids .
i know that the hon minister of education has not allowed a moment of complacency .
however , the standing committee noted their concern with regard to project chrysalis and related issues .
with regard to vote 1 - premier , director-general and corporate services , investigations have to be done .
mr speaker , i believe that scof will agree to the western cape adjustments appropriation bill , 2001 , without any problem .
we often talk in the province about the role of smmes and the importance of small business .
r11,9 million for compensation for the extra cost of fuel price increases and other inflationary pressures ; and
the committee further wishes to express its concern over the delay in the appointment of the commissioner for the environment .
] he will have launched that last attack to divert attention from his own failures .
he has not been able to increase the anc 's membership in this province .
did the hon member mr ozinsky imply that the hon premier was involved in improper conduct ?
they criticised me because this was the only province that provided azt to pregnant women .
] we will never allow anyone to attempt to buy our members by stealth .
] however , let me say to them , our members are not up for auction .
] i was there and the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs was with me .
i would like the hon leader of the opposition to make it clear as to what he is implying .
mr speaker , i realise there is no immediate or quick-fix solution to this problem .
it is a total disgrace when one sees people having to walk in that sludge .
in the recent case problems were experienced with two pumps and back-up pump at the zandvliet sewage treatment works .
by doing that it would reduce water usage by thousands of litres that would normally flow into the system .
( 3 ) how many of these incidents have resulted in successful investigation and apprehension of vandals ?
( 2 ) how many additional police officers have joined the service , excluding community police forums , for the same period ?
hon members will recall that i have raised this in the house on a number of occasions already .
mr speaker , the hon member did not quite listen to what i said .
then one has a contract which runs over a period that must be phased in .
( 3 ) whether he will make a statement on the presence of houses on grotto bay beach ;
the service delivery programme is revisited and updated on a continuous basis and will be published in april 2000 .
madam chairperson , various initiatives have also been instituted with a view to improving provincial own revenue .
with regard to hospital fees , a private debt collection agency for all hospitals was appointed with effect from 1 march 1999 .
the long walk to freedom will have no final destination unless we break the economic chains .
we in the western cape are not obsessed with race , but institutionalised racism has screwed up this province .
correct information in respect of the distribution of salary levels is not available in most instances .
we do not support all the motions put forward by the hon member of the acdp .
i would be prepared to overlook that if the hon member would only speak a little slower .
the dp recommends that cape town be designated a free port area with an adjacent free trade zone area .
madam chairperson , one can imagine the jobs we could create in this regard .
the latest hsrc opinion poll released yesterday shows that job creation is the most important consideration of all south africans .
this is a critical and watershed new approach and we welcome it .
messrs kobus meiring and lampie fick , who were referred to by the hon member mr ismail , have gone .
i do not understand how the r10 million will attempt to address this high unemployment .
in the private sector , there is one golden rule that determines the success or failure of an undertaking .
i am not sure how many times the chairperson of the gambling board has gone to las vegas .
we have a serious problem in that the casino is going to be very close to the working class area of elsies river .
the organogram shows a sun west procurement manager and then there is a direct line to contractors .
this is the attitude that we do not want to hear - they cannot do that .
madam chairperson , i thank the hon member mr strachan for his remarks in regard to gambling .
then i move on to the latest interjector , the hon member mr gabru , who criticised the chairperson .
it is the responsibility of the gambling board to take on these matters and to investigate them .
order will bring about prosperity and prosperity will bring about peace and / or reduced crime levels .
prior to 1990 the total police compliment of the rsa and tbvc countries was in excess of 200 000 officers .
the first , which most people are familiar with , is the function of civilian oversight over the saps .
this is undoubtedly the sphere that offers the greatest potential to have a positive effect on crime levels .
however i want to warn that the people 's eyes have been opened , and the hsrc report has already proved that .
perhaps we are referring here to setting aside funds allocated under their votes , specifically for security programmes .
that hon member should not persist in speaking while the hon member mr lewis is delivering his speech .
these thefts look like organised efforts and are having a negative impact on farming in the little karoo .
i also wish to thank dep comm dirk crafford for the many long years of service he has rendered .
he did not mention it , but the saps is also 40 % under-supplied with motor vehicles .
the saps must also be complimented on the metamorphosis programme , which also seems to be doing a great deal of work .
in the course of our discussion i asked the hon minister where the project originated .
he and i were driving in the oudtshoorn area one day and we saw a small dry bush next to the road .
are they happy that we have a shrinking police force , that is 35 % under strength ...
with all the women and children who are raped and brutalised every weekend in this province .
but we have no authority over where metrorail wants to deploy the people they have sponsored .
the police service and defence force are there to create stabilisation mechanisms , but stabilisation is not normalisation .
in this regard the hon minister is once again achieving success in combining his two portfolios .
it is also good to hear that pps is generating funds for the department and for sport institutions .
i feel , however , that the hon minister also has to take some initiative around this .
a similar event is the upcoming two oceans marathon where , once again , millions of rand will change hands .
this type of spirit that can catapult us into the new era has to be welcomed by all .
this is to be welcomed , as our facilities in the poor rural communities are indeed sparse and inadequate .
the hon minister and his department should be complimented on satisfying some of these demands .
madam chairperson , to begin with i want to thank the department of sport and recreation on behalf of the anc .
by that , i do not mean permanently removed from society , either , [ laughter .
i should just bring to her attention that school sports facilities are the property of the relevant department .
there are , however , many schools that have adequate facilities , but they are in a disgraceful condition .
much has been said about former model c schools or white schools , or whatever they have been called .
do hon members know how much money those parents pay for grounds staff to maintain those fields ?
in fact , on the total budget we only have personnel expenditure of 22,95 % .
our cabinet to the people project is part of our endeavour to promote transparency and accountability in government .
we owe it to our constituencies to get our province and south africa working .
perhaps the transition to the year 2000 did not give everyone what they wanted .
overseas it is general practice that vehicles are declared roadworthy every year when registration licences are renewed .
we are already engaged in an initiative to place all law enforcement agencies under a single umbrella .
in order to check the trend of urbanisation the development of the rural areas must be given more serious attention .
our rural areas have so much to offer , not only for tourism but also as far as agricultural development is concerned .
the lines between centralism and coordinated cooperative governance between all spheres of government are becoming increasingly blurred .
we have a training academy - it is the only provincial academy of its kind in the country .
why not an african renaissance training academy , where we can share our administrative skills with our neighbours ?
it is an election which will need political maturity from all the different parties , and other role-players .
promotion of administrative justice bill [ b 56b-99 ] .
this fundamental truth has been reconfirmed many times during my visits to some 103 schools during my term of office so far .
we hope to make it a standard feature of our education planning support to schools .
] suffice it to say that we have made a very great deal of progress .
as the person responsible for this , the director of curriculum management mr brian schreuder , has worked wonders .
educationists throughout the world agree that transforming a curriculum is a major undertaking .
the mathematics education programme at uct has also played a particularly supportive role in mathematics education in many schools .
our priority here is to develop new curricular routes with particular emphasis on vocational , technical and skills training .
we will also try to incorporate new curricular options in ordinary schools as well as technical colleges .
last year the maintenance budget for schools , including the aftermath of the manenberg disaster , was r44 million .
these schools also received training and support in the administrative and educational use of the internet .
what does the hon leader of the opposition think i am reading - a menu ?
sir , initially the new schools and youth care centres will make use of existing facilities that will be adapted .
these contrasting positions on the nature of change are summed up by a specialist on education , one fulham , who says :
it is not superintendents-general that effect change , and it is not opposition mps that effect change .
too many schools still lack basic facilities and have overcrowded classrooms .
the science laboratory must be one of the better equipped in the region , if not the country .
therefore major agreements and policy decisions in education are determined by industrial relations interests rather than educational considerations .
it is nice to know that a person can have such passion for education .
i really thought that the hon member mr gabru 's speech was a very constructive one .
] well , if it is backed up by fiscal discipline and policy that will definitely make a difference .
" truly , the mission statement of this department , " to provide education of a world-class standard , " needs to be lauded .
madam chairperson , it is a special privilege to participate in this debate .
i want all hon members to have a picture of the conditions in this school .
the hon member mr williams also referred to the naming of schools and the problems in that regard .
hon members will have noticed that i have avoided doing so right up till now .
the results of those investigations , for the information of the hon member mr gabru , are nearly completed .
i also want to refer to the contribution by the hon member mr lewis and thank him very much for that .
i must say that she has been very supportive and i want to thank her for her constructive contributions .
that school is one of our most problematic and difficult schools in crisis in the entire system .
we will work with them and with the hon member in trying to achieve that .
despite that , the teachers are doing heroic work and all indications are that we have improved the quality .
the key to our strategy lies very simply in service , s-e-r-v-i-c-e , where -
we continue to prioritise spending on primary health care , based on the cost-effectiveness of these interventions .
the " e " in " service " stands for " efficient and effective management " .
i do not need to dwell today on the magnitude or seriousness of these related epidemics .
suffice it to say that combating these epidemics has been identified as a priority .
he said that as a young man he had helped to build the tygerberg hospital as a plasterer .
nevertheless , all too often i encounter members of the public who have been the target of an insensitive attitude .
i also wish to thank the staff - the top management and all who are sitting behind their desks today .
the end product , however , will be a health care system in equilibrium , guaranteeing service delivery to all our people .
this is certainly an important step in the process towards restoring basic health rights to our people .
madam chairperson , the paltry increase in the budget allocation for orthotic and prosthetic services is entirely unacceptable .
maternal and child health policy needs to be located within a general development policy providing access to an adequate standard of living .
non-existent trauma training regrettably also applies at intern level in most of our hospitals .
our present referral system via day hospitals is putting the lives of thousands of patients at risk .
] from one half of the coalition we have heard a speech of a high standard .
introduce a massive enhancement of hiv / aids awareness within my ministry ...
however , he has not come with a plan on how he is dealing with the nursing situation .
r44 million already goes toward defraying the r60 million deficit that he has incurred .
we have had a total closure of 204 beds , which was occasioned by the loss of staff .
they are very constructive in all the meetings when we sit down to address the issues .
now , four months later , the bill on the health facilities board will be tabled here .
if people do not change their lifestyles , we are never going to win against this disease .
the work study investigated the structure of the head office , the district offices and the institutions of the branch .
we recognise that the lives of street children are linked to poverty , domestic violence , substance abuse and high rates of unemployment .
] in 1995 south africa ratified the united nations convention on the rights of the child .
it is our objective to submit a cabinet memorandum in this regard before the end of this year .
this will be done at a cost of r1,6 million in vredendal and r2 million in beaufort west .
of these , nine have already been dismissed or have resigned and two appealed against their convictions .
the allocation of the national poverty relief fund to the province for the 1999-2000 financial year was pruned drastically , however .
it is therefore crucial that the matter be dealt with in a holistic and effective , but caring , manner .
in this respect , the nco sector has become a major role-player in the fight against hiv / aids .
the alliance is currently focusing on the training and retraining of departmental staff , including social workers .
therefore , the main casualties were among south africa 's most needy people - the poorest of the poor .
mr chairperson , large sectors of the population are caught in a cycle of poverty and marginalisation .
poverty alleviation is also about addressing the problems children are faced with in their daily lives .
we believe that that is integral and we would like to see it facilitated .
- the establishment of a provincial gender equality commission which will take actions and implement projects in order to attain gender equality ;
it just needs - let me use her own words - an interministerial , interdepartmental cabinet committee .
we have no right to fix the quality of life of pensioners below the minimum subsistence level .
madam chairperson , pensioners are the people who built their country over the past 50 years .
the road to economic emancipation for black and coloured people is the creation of a entrepreneurial class amongst them .
we must show all future tenderers that we are serious about the integrity of public money .
how do we , for example , expand far more rapidly the rate at which we establish service centres for the aged in communities ?
the more we bicker round the poverty alleviation issue , the more our people on the ground are suffering .
we look forward to having the same relationship with our standing committee and , of course , with scof .
mr speaker , during the recent rains in the little karoo and the southern cape , a considerable number of roads were washed away .
madam chairperson , it is ironic that you are in the chair as i present my budget speech .
this is the fifth consecutive year in which i have presented vote 8 - housing to this house .
a total of more than r999,7 million has been spent to date on the establishment of housing opportunities .
the western cape housing act of 1997 lays the responsibility for housing development squarely in the lap of local government .
these subsidies may only be accessed on a project basis , because these beneficiaries do not have legal security of tenure .
the housing consumers protection measures act , 1998 ( act 95 of 1998 ) , is now in place .
the only manner in which one can irrefutably determine that is by the introduction of a formalised tender process .
the effect of this move is that the finalisation of restitution claims will not be complicated by a separate landowner .
this project will provide approximately 800 job opportunities and represent an international investment of ( us ) $ 120 million .
madam chairperson , i would like to thank all my officials for their selfless dedication to the housing process .
i am also happy to accept the fact that he is busy with a vigorous information campaign .
those people in the bo-kaap have peace of mind today , because they got their flats .
] i hope and trust that those people will have the opportunity to get their land back .
it is clear that the spin doctors must think of some new lines fast .
it is further estimated that the country 's housing needs are growing by approximately 200 000 units per year .
this , in turn , leads to the slowing of further delivery of housing within local authorities that are affected .
take smartie town in macassar , for example , where r150 000 went in , and again people are suffering .
madam chairperson , the hon minister of housing spoke about the question of farm workers and subsidies .
why do local transitional councils drag their feet when home-owners can acquire ownership by way of the r7 500 discount benefit scheme ?
it is estimated that the housing backlog in the metro is around 200 000 , of which half is in cape town .
what the hon minister failed to tell us is how the fund is going to be used .
what is unique about this project is the involvement of the private sector , in the form of corobrik .
] in the meantime , people conveniently forget how many houses were built in cape town 's jurisdiction in terms of the islp .
one then just has to take part in every debate , and that is the only way in which one ...
] i think hon members on that side of the house will concede that absolutely .
the community centre in paarl received an amount of r275 000 , on which i congratulate them too .
seeing that we have big problems with finance and credit control , let it be a challenge to all of us .
our local government organisation , weclogo , is playing a major role in this province , and we thank them for that .
the first step we need to take is to do management audits within the different municipalities .
i will now move on to the coordination of disaster management and refer briefly to the existing structures .
every politician then wants to take over control of the disaster situation and each one seems to know better than the next one .
they have already been cleared with all technical and professional interest groups and will shortly be published for comment .
wards are going to be demarcated according to the number of registered voters in each area , as on 31 march .
we believe the future of local government must be achieved through sustainable social , economic , political and environmental issues .
the councillors that are now in the non-metropolitan area were appointed to the district transformation forum proportionately .
this is the body that will actually look at how services related to electricity provision are rendered .
the next matter is operational growth and the annual capping that we want to put on local authorities .
] often this was to the benefit of the community , but we will have to judge that .
we should be careful that the locus standi of the provincial government should not be questioned one day .
i asked mr naud in passing how far they were with the civil protection bill .
i am sorry ; i did not mean to excite the hon member with that !
the purpose of such a law would be to regulate the levying of property rates by municipalities .
there we have the hon member mr ramatlakane , who is being prepared to become the executive mayor .
today the hon minister told us nothing about even a single point in the 100-day programme .
mr chairperson , the hon minister told us about the voter education that he was going to provide .
the hon minister knows what the south peninsula council did with the building that they bought .
madam chairperson , the transition over the next few months demands a high level of political maturity .
if the hon minister of local government had anything to do with that , i want to thank him .
as a result of that , budgeting , accounting , credit control and financial reporting systems were weak , to say the least .
my people voted in 1994 , they voted in 1995 , and they voted in 1999 .
] crossroads and other informal settlements are still begging for redevelopment , while the province is a helpless bystander .
according to the figures , 30 % of local authorities are in the red and they are technically insolvent .
they want to use the cama system - the computer-aided mass appraisal system - which is available across the world .
i could have promulgated an ordinance about valuations last year , but that would have been unwise .
i assure hon members that there is building work that has to be done , and about that there can be no doubt .
madam chairperson , i want to refer to the contributions of the hon members messrs lewis and louis .
between september and december last year , the draft policy went through a review process which included the following .
in conclusion , there are two further matters which i wish to bring to the attention of this parliament .
if it will make the hon member ms essop happy , she can make it half a century .
we will closely monitor the process of integrating the different communities at present and in the future .
as the hon minister has said , to date we still do not have that policy .
related to that is the fifth delay , which is the establishment of the planning review board .
" practically , the hon minister knows it is not as easy as that .
this implies unambiguously that in the broad planning process there is a role for this province to play .
it is not just about salaries , as the hon premier would like us to believe .
in the next speech i am sure he will address both racial and gender representivity .
madam chairperson , i would like to thank the hon minister of finance and development planning and his staff .
let me put it on record that we are very concerned about what is going to happen to the pdc .
if this proposal goes forward , it will control 90 % of the key institutions in this province .
madam chairperson , i would also like to mention the issue of the provincial integrated development framework .
thank you , madam chairperson . it gave me a chance to have a sip of water .
where i come from , the business sector , one is required to give deadlines in matters .
i believe in a little frivolity and i do think that i have a sense of humour .
i would like to thank him for his contribution , especially with regard to the biosphere and the coastal zoning policy .
he comes from the knysna area in the southern cape , so he definitely has an interest in these matters .
i just want to make it clear that the nominations do not come from the general public .
in time , we foresee that it will rival the rio carnival and the mardi gras festivals of new orleans .
we can no longer afford to have a passive approach to combating aids .
several language-related projects have been initiated and more will be funded in the following year .
madam chairperson , the standing committee is fully aware of the importance of libraries in our communities .
no one will check whether what is in the environmental impact assessment is what happens on the ground .
that is exactly what happened in the department of the hon minister of finance and development planning .
last sunday i was privileged to attend the meeting of the south african christmas band council at vygieskraal .
i think the hon member mr ozinsky mentioned this , and i must agree with him .
this particular tbhc , if one goes through the list , is listed quite consistently and quite regularly .
nevertheless at a recent meeting , a motion to begin with mass action was rejected out of hand .
the hon member can also rest assured that i will ensure that the language committee fulfils its mandate .
she enjoyed a lovely concert with me at the nico malan complex the other night .
i am afraid i am very reluctant to open up this can of worms again .
the next point on the order paper is a notice of motion by the hon member mr king .
that is the old service debt which they told the people not to pay .
mr speaker , it is an insult to refer to our people as " peanuts " .
] when i made the point , it was said that that was for the " peanuts " .
i regret that the hon member 's time has expired . he therefore cannot continue .
it is expected that for subsequent years the increase in licence fees will not exceed 20 % .
however , toll roads are undoubtedly an option in order to deliver roads that comply with specific needs , for example tourism .
the damage to the roads of the province caused by overloaded vehicles is currently running at approximately r40 million every year .
r16 million of this amount is needed for the funding of specialised maintenance repair work which will be done on contract .
it is expected that the meiringspoort contract , which is estimated to cost r50 million , will be completed in june 2000 .
six projects for community access roads , which were designed and documented by selected developing consultants , will shortly be advertised .
thus far r1,2 million has been collected , and this has exceeded the initial estimates by approximately 20 % .
the only increase is the r44 million made available by the department of health for upgrading .
the first category is the construction of buildings and structures , for which the total budget amounts to r84,7 million .
now that he is leaving , what is going to happen to the metropolitan transport authority on which he has been working so hard ?
an amount of r500 000 was given to this vehicle to do pilot projects in cape town .
i realise the importance of the skills and the entrepreneurial nature of the work in this department .
everyone will cooperate in seeking to resolve the problem which the hon minister recognised there .
the former members of the labour party , who later joined the np , know what i am talking about .
i want to thank the hon minister for the new number-plates that government vehicles are going to get .
there is serious concern about the decay of the road network in south africa , but specifically of the rural roads .
south africa used to be able to say with pride that we had the best road network in africa , despite apartheid .
too much money that should have been used for the development of road infrastructure was used for other purposes .
madam chairperson , in order to confirm the statistics i should like to mention two examples in my service area .
the sandveld , to which the hon member mr fransman has just referred , is the potato larder of south africa .
the agriculture and tourist industries on the cardouw road and dasklip pass at porterville generate an income of r36 million annually .
therefore , to take 45 minutes over 22 km of road is an indication of the state of the road .
needless to say , the grading did not help at all , even though they did grade the road .
i shall persist in talking about it until the road is regravelled in its entirety and in due course tarred .
madam chairperson , i telephoned the relevant departments in three of our provinces regarding motor vehicle licences .
the ordinary man in the street will now have to cough up 25 % extra in licensing fees .
mr chairperson , in contrast to the other provinces , western cape has increased its licence fees by 25 % .
the way in which the emphasis for training courses has shifted to the ongoing maintenance of roads is gratifying .
there are provincial roads running through local areas , and the hon member mr mckenzie ought to know that .
this is a case that has emerged in the constituency of the hon member mr ozinsky , bridgetown .
this tender , the original one which was withdrawn , would have given small and medium enterprises an opportunity .
for instance , in one category there needed to be a minimum ownership of 10 sedan vehicles and 10 vip vehicles .
madam chairperson , i should like to thank all hon members who have participated in the debate .
the department of transport voted r2 million for obstructions , removing loose rocks and cleaning up the place .
morkel only creates work for his family , and then craig does not even attend the caucus meetings .
the money will not simply be thrown around without accounting for its spending .
madam chairperson , i call upon hon members to support us on the increase in the fuel price .
i just wish to give him fair warning : when we say certain things to one another , we should keep our word .
when a proposer has good intentions with a motion , then politics ought not to be involved .
we then cannot take a decision on the original motion as printed on the order paper .
" mr speaker , i can quote the names of the full committee , if you prefer .
] i do think the hon member ms essop does look rather stylish with that on her head !
fourthly , there are serious problems with the enabling environment , of which unacceptably high levels of crime is probably the most important .
they are putting a few hundred satellites into low-earth orbit to provide cellphones .
the constant rise of new challenges forces both the private and public sectors to speed up decision-making .
we do not in this province want township tourism and mainstream tourism ; they are , in essence , the same thing .
madam chairperson , the support component on the other hand , is typically the prerogative of the public sector .
at the initiative of the tourism board khayelitsha has been included in the national " cluster " pilot projects .
approximately 80 % of the schools earmarked for the project are in previously disadvantaged communities .
we owe a great deal to mtn and the sa airports company for their sponsorship of this project .
fourthly , we will continue our strategising and support around the development of a high tech cluster .
in the meantime they will continue with their excellent work , which also involves activities in a variety of related fields .
madam chairperson , the department has established a close working relationship with nocosa , the aids awareness ngo .
part of our task is to fully capacitate these offices to deal effectively with consumer complaints .
mr chairperson , we no longer can see ourselves in the western cape as just a small economy .
i think the time has come for us to start putting pressure on the national government regarding innovative taxation schemes .
the hon minister has mentioned this matter and i think we are going to see it in the green paper .
that is why i could never support the spending of a lot of money on valuation .
we must build on our strengths and advantages , including the possibilities that exist in the knowledge-based sectors .
i am not sure that this catch-all phrase can work , and i will explain why later .
apart from their day-to-day functions , formulating new policy seems to be one of their main drives .
a friend of mine , ms annie rhodes of hornlee in knysna , resides opposite one of these taverns .
madam chairperson , public representatives need to take responsibility for the wellbeing of the people they represent .
there are very clear signs that the hon minister and this government do not have that attitude .
because the disadvantaged and developing tourism operators and businessmen are not represented , their interests are largely ignored .
the opening of the international convention centre in durban has strengthened the position of south africa in this market .
] i knew that the hon minister of finance and development planning was absolutely bursting to get out .
the fact is of course that in 1998 , 26 % of the exports of the western cape went to africa .
the national government has embarked - and we fully support them - on a road of global interaction .
to pick the terrible fruits in our public administration of a form of empowerment that is fundamentally disempowering south africans .
madam chairperson , 80 % of the proprietors of liquor outlets in this province are not white .
he said that when it came to local tourist bureaux or inputs , there was race prejudice .
they are dismantling the legacy of nelson mandela brick by brick , because the attempts that he made to bring about reconciliation ...
the hon member ms essop made very constructive comments , for which i have already given her recognition .
these , and the fast changing market , necessitate cutting-edge technologies to produce products at market prices .
at the same time we know that agricultural products are dependent on environmental factors and are therefore extremely exposed to high risks .
this is because outside agriculture there is a very limited market for agricultural inputs .
i appeal to president mbeki to make a statement on this in public .
i think it is a great pity that i still have to endorse a very small budget of r74 million .
we mentioned this earlier , and the hon minister of agriculture also discussed it today .
i wish to elucidate this with the example of a wine farmer from vredendal who has been farming for about 30 years .
the coordinating committee is of the opinion that up to 120 tonnes of tomatoes could be produced in the first season .
madam chairperson , i now wish to thank the top management of the chief directorate : agriculture for what they are doing .
madam chairperson , it is really a privilege to participate in the agricultural debate .
madam chairperson , it was a pleasure to listen to the hon member mr fransman .
to say that those people are merely " add-on 's " , is too much .
what about the cases , like nelson 's creek , where the land was given to the farm workers ?
planning was done for beautiful face brick houses which any of us in this house would like to have .
fortunately the milk producers ' association has now entered the struggle in an effort to limit mass dumpings to some extent .
the kwv then had to seek another market for its white wine , and it obtained it in france .
to me it is absolutely unimaginable that people can do this when many other farmers are taking out good stein vineyards .
madam chairperson , to begin with i wish to state very clearly that i am speaking on behalf of thousands of farm workers .
i invite the hon member mr dugmore to join me in challenging the other provinces .
besides those so-called areas , we are also working in 30 new communities where new farmers have been settled .
if the hon member ms versfeld wants to start heckling , she should do it from her own seat .
i should like to encourage agricultural schools in the rural areas , be they at touws river or in khayelitsha .
] the story about calitzdorp may be true , that farmers are prepared to buy the rdp houses .
if any party wants to make a declaration of vote , that party is entitled to make such a declaration .
they were also not submitted during the debate on the budget vote of the hon minister concerned .
we are now voting on the schedule , and if hon members raise an objection it must be noted .
we are now going to vote , and we will be noting the objections within each overall vote in the schedule .
council for the built environment bill [ b16-2000 ] .
project and construction management profession bill [ b21-2000 ] .
our cabinet to the people project is part of our endeavour to promote transparency and accountability in government .
we owe it to our constituencies to get our province and south africa working .
perhaps the transition to the year 2000 did not give everyone what they wanted .
overseas it is general practice that vehicles are declared roadworthy every year when registration licences are renewed .
we are already engaged in an initiative to place all law enforcement agencies under a single umbrella .
in order to check the trend of urbanisation the development of the rural areas must be given more serious attention .
our rural areas have so much to offer , not only for tourism but also as far as agricultural development is concerned .
the lines between centralism and coordinated cooperative governance between all spheres of government are becoming increasingly blurred .
we have a training academy - it is the only provincial academy of its kind in the country .
why not an african renaissance training academy , where we can share our administrative skills with our neighbours ?
it is an election which will need political maturity from all the different parties , and other role-players .
( b ) assist with creating infrastructure for the distribution of medication ; and
with that aim in mind i shall appeal to all law enforcement agencies to support me in this .
at 12 : 52 today i received a letter of support from the national minister of transport .
we also dealt with section 38 of this act , to do with the " proof of certain facts " .
lastly , mr speaker , we dealt extensively with the issue of impounding vehicles .
on permits , we say that objections to permit applications by private companies or individuals must be stopped henceforth .
mr speaker , the udm supports the content of the western cape road transportation act amendment bill .
in this instance we are talking about the transformation of the taxi industry , but that simply escapes the dp .
we have found that they are not prepared to address the real issue .
this also affects other modes of transport which may be affected as this situation is taken further .
but i say that this amendment bill must become the means whereby we regain stability in those communities ...
mr speaker , i now wish to extend my sincere thanks to the hon member mr ismail for his wonderful support .
however , we shall only do so if we are convinced that the situation at ground level justifies it .
mr speaker , that is exactly how the new np deals with the cape flats in general .
the 15-year-old crescendo august of ravensmead was raped and murdered over the weekend - no urgency ?
mr speaker , the matter that is before us at the moment is an extremely important one .
i heard that the government of zimbabwe had imported tens of thousands of firearms which they were going to distribute there .
from the perspective of seeking a solution i want to suggest two things today and try to address two problems .
ultimately they are accorded poor treatment , the case takes a long time and eventually they turn to the media .
a whole paradigm shift in the thinking of the people about the establishment of human rights should take place .
but when chris nissen was the responsible minister , he went to the shebeens and promised liquor licences .
i want to thank the hon member mr byneveldt sincerely for having placed it on the order paper .
ultimately the total police manpower of this country is approximately 55 000 to 60 000 members .
zero tolerance is predicated upon visible policing - and this is where hon members must pay attention .
visible policing means one has to have bobbies on the beat to apply zero tolerance .
when i delivered my budget speech there were 21 police stations that did not deliver a 24-hour service .
i wish to make a polite appeal to hon members to go and sit in the gallery in the national assembly on thursday .
one sees this currently in the legal system , the corrective services system , the police and in welfare .
] the fact of the matter is the undermining by the anc , and that is the problem .
do those hon members not understand that they are making the already weak situation much weaker ?
i am not going to go into all the points that were raised by the various hon members .
firstly , the people visiting the country gain the impression that the country is under martial law .
- and serious problems are cropping up , who is to be called up to rectify the situation ?
to hold the provincial government accountable for not making the western cape safe and secure .
hon members must hand their motions without notice and notices of motion in at the table .
yesterday the anc argued that this expenditure that had been incurred should be referred to public accounts .
mr speaker , the facts are firstly , there was a call from the national government .
the hon member mr ismail spoke to the house of what the other provinces did .
it is personally directly related , because i want here today to make that commitment to being constructive .
it also came from the chief of government communications , jole netshitenzhe , and from dr frank chikane as well .
the director-general and some of his officials answered the question as to why this expenditure was incurred , very clearly .
it is evident from my information that many offices were empty of officials - they were closed !
i believe that there were occasions when that could have been done , be it at a rules committee meeting or a meeting of the whips .
it defines " volunteer " as someone who offers to do something , someone who undertakes ...
the 430 volunteers were only those 430 top officials ; no one lower down in the ranks was interested .
that is the number of officials who were still needed to enable the registration campaign to succeed successfully .
mr speaker , the decision we took in the standing committee meeting was the correct decision .
] there cannot simply be the broad response that they were spent on registration .
if hon members ask a minister three questions , the minister will have to respond to those questions .
madam chairperson , what has happened here is that that opportunity was not allowed in scof .
madam chairperson , if i may say so , this unauthorised expenditure was incurred in the financial years 1998-99 and 1999-2000 .
i have posed a formal question and i should have an answer from the hon minister .
they must appreciate that we cannot do everything , including washing up the teacups .
if the hon member wants me to i will reply to that question in writing .
madam chairperson , could i ask the hon minister of social services and poverty relief a question ?
madam chairperson , i do not have the foggiest idea on what date it was done .
the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs should apologise and withdraw it .
the details from the telephone conversation are as i have given them to the hon member here today .
madam chairperson , i am saying that if teachers were taken out of their classrooms , i will condemn it .
then the hon member mr ozinsky was party to taking teachers out of the classroom .
i told hon members that they were officials who are lower in rank than an assistant director .
] we will give the answers , but this is not the way to do it .
i am going to ask hon members to put their questions in writing and the speaker will respond to them .
from local government an amount of r316 000 of this amount was spent .
if it did not come from housing and only r316 000 came from planning ...
madam chairperson , on a point of order : i have been accused of being in contempt of the house .
i would like nobody else to speak to whether or not the procedure is frivolous .
i have no other option here but to allow each hon member three questions .
i would assess that crime should have been considered in that light , particularly the issue of community safety .
however , i assume it comes from the vote of the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs .
madam chairperson , i prefer to answer the question after investigation with the department .
if they were taken out of school for training to do voter registration i will condemn it .
madam chairperson , the hon member ms essop will have to address her question to the provincial treasury .
madam chairperson , on a point of order : is a speaker allowed to make rude signs ...
we are now busy with vote 14 - transport and works , and the figure is r36 000 .
does the hon minister of finance and development planning propose that we have the third reading now ?
there has been an objection to this - that is actually what the hon member ms essop was doing .
who would argue , for example , that the western cape must be made safer by tackling gangsterism ?
we have a unique opportunity to learn the lessons attached to a programme for lifestyle change .
on 5 december 2000 , 6 out of 10 of their supporters did not go to the ballot box .
when i was in clarkes estate on friday i walked through a number of blocks in that area .
it is clear that municipal policing will play a crucial role in turning the corner on crime .
municipal policing in terms of the legislation has three functions - traffic policing , crime prevention and the enforcement of municipal bylaws .
i am convinced , however , that the department already has the key strategies ready to achieve their vision .
mr speaker , it has been said many times before that strategies without actions will remain just strategies .
nobody should question which areas are we talking about when we talk about the 80 % pass rate !
careful consideration will have to be given to the appointment of a black provincial deputy commissioner of police .
next , mr speaker , i want to refer briefly to the monitoring cameras and the expansion of the programme .
mr speaker , the last two points i want to single out are the bombs and the taxi violence .
i find it a pity that the hon premier does not give credit where credit is due .
mr speaker , the expression " empty vessels make the most noise " is so true .
mr speaker , the announcement that there will be greater focus on rural development is welcomed .
the people expected the hon premier to say yesterday when they would receive the services .
in beaufort west , where the anc governs , people are already enjoying a certain amount of free basic services .
the local government in durban is leading the way in regard to the implementation of municipal policing .
mr speaker , what we need is not simply a statement of five strategic priorities .
he behaves as if crossroads is his own personal fiefdom and all the residents are his vassals .
for freeing her from the oppression caused by the np in the past .
there is no such thing as the western cape economy in isolation from the rest of the country .
it is a legacy left by apartheid , which the hon premier is trying to thrive on .
we are inundated with hiv-positive patients not only from the surrounding areas but from the eastern cape .
he stood in the election as an anc candidate , but did not make it .
the victims are the people who are prepared to pick as many as 120 boxes of grapes a day .
mr speaker , we welcome the fact that the council will hold its first meeting later this month .
the hon minister of education may not interject from a seat other than her own .
in one newspaper article it stated , " anc actually gain in poll " .
i agree with the hon premier when he said yesterday , " south africa is crying out for transparent , corruption-free government .
within a south african context it is not in anybody 's interest to have impoverished neighbours .
that is why we are so appalled and saddened as to what is happening in zimbabwe .
this will develop rural areas in an integrated way and in this way bring about a balance so that we can eliminate poverty systematically .
i believe that this objective is the key to the mobilisation of growth points in the rural areas .
our presence there will mean that we have a say in eu regulations before they are officially announced .
over the past six months , and during the festive season , we in the western cape have been shocked by farm murders .
calculated in money terms , this means a financial loss of approximately r400 million per annum to sheep theft alone .
with great bravado general statements were made depicting agriculturists as violent and merciless employers .
according to them , the work now goes to new entrants in the industry since the election in 1999 .
may i also congratulate mr malatsi on his appointment as minister of social services and poverty relief .
we have been delivering on the prevention of mother-to-child transmission for more than two years .
the hiv / aids programme of this country is highly regarded and we shall be watching the situation carefully .
if i might just take a second to highlight what is really good and what is depressing .
mr speaker , i should also like to thank the department for their inputs into the second adjustments appropriation .
then we are still told that we do not have a plan for developmental poverty relief .
the question to the hon minister is whether this is not a payment back to the casino .
the then ministers had to come up with a business plan , but a business plan was not obtained .
i am answering the question of the hon member mr ozinsky , which i do not usually do .
there are various sectors in the city and those control rooms also need to link into this in the ...
madam chairperson , may i ask how many other impressions the hon minister has presented here as facts ?
madam chairperson , " incorrect component linkages " means instances where people have been wrongly placed in the various departments .
the majority of beneficiaries are ngos , and they already have their own key measurable objectives and business plans .
subsidies are given to preprimary schools and crches , and subsidies and grants are also given to old-age homes .
the first appellant was the national government , and as soon as they provide the other finance , we can continue .
i hope he understands that it is an abbreviation for minister of environment and culture .
] i ask the question : is it the udm , is it the new np or the anc ?
] mr speaker , as i cast my eyes , some of them just lowered their heads .
mr speaker , the important thing about this is that only the local road transportation board can give a licence .
to get a licence from the local road transportation board one needs to prove a need .
4. political parties of this house to buy into the process of stabilising this province .
at that time 50 % of the industry , particularly in the african townships , had been kicked out of the system .
is it because the anc is part of khayelitsha and they are not part of khayelitsha ?
i told him that the situation was untenable and that the matter needed to be addressed immediately .
may i say that from 05 : 00 until i was informed at 08 : 00 not one ...
] from 05 : 00 until 08 : 00 , when i was informed , not one taxi had been impounded .
" if the hon minister does not know what he is doing , how can he be taken seriously ?
let me tell hon members why i have not done so thus far .
all the applications we received in regard to the formalisation had been disposed of on 31 december .
] those people sent me faxes to say that i should close the taxi ranks .
i would like to tabulate the steps that have led to the cape town international convention centre company bill .
it is estimated currently that an international conference-goer visiting south africa spends on average about r20 000 here .
the hon minister of finance and development planning made a very special contribution , as did dr stegmann .
when one steps inside the caf royal one enters a world of quiet refinement and traditional elegance .
i also wish to extend my thanks to ms laurine platsky , mr pierre oosthuizen and ms carol johnson .
however , at that stage legislation did not feature ; it was not even in the pipeline .
the agreement makes no reference to the preferential procurement act that was passed at national level .
mr speaker , the cv of the hon minister of finance and development planning contained something interesting .
i repeat , this is subject to a maximum - not to a minimum - of r60 million .
that was clearly in the minds of both the legal people and the directors all along .
the hon member mr e isaacs used the excellent example of the caf royal in london .
this is an agreement that i have with the national minister of environmental affairs and tourism , among others .
the anc would like to insert a new subsection ( 2 ) , which would then read as follows :
it may only hold equity if it fulfils the objects and applies the affirmative action principles .
for the purposes of the provincial government making a financial contribution to convenco ...
we have sent the deputy secretary out of the house to obtain clarity and we will come back to it .
( xii ) firearms control bill [ b34-2000 ] .
( 2 ) personal visits by some members of the house have confirmed that state of affairs ;
( 4 ) intimidation of both academic and non-academic staff occur at some of these schools ; and
( 3 ) expresses the hope that operations and actions of this nature will continuously be conducted .
he said that the issue was all-inclusive and that they had discussed it with various parties .
mr speaker , i can understand why the support for the new np is dropping .
i left that detail for the hon minister before he came to the department .
they should look at what their pensions are going to be , because they will not be here long .
the hon minister merely thought a few months ahead , and that is why they are carrying on like that .
they even asked to address the hon premier of the western cape about the executive mayor .
mr speaker , i shall spare you the pain , i withdraw the word " lieg " .
the new np is of the opinion that this could give rise to seizure of power by a mayor .
the anc in this province has once again shown its craving and lust for power ...
mayoral candidates may therefore be appointed according to their political affiliations rather than their skills for the job .
] the hon member mr mckenzie knows full well what happened in the standing committee meeting on monday morning .
i also thank the hon member mr silke who focused on the whole process of centralisation .
the hon member did not quote it , nor does it appear in his amendment .
is this perhaps the reason why we find that there is widespread lawlessness in the country ?
we do not even have enough police officers to protect the present number of inhabitants of the province .
] well , i can understand that they do not get up , but that does not matter .
what was wrong in the past will definitely be more wrong in terms of the new system in south africa .
what is disturbing is that anc politicians have made a significant contribution towards promoting this perception .
the cover-up of the helderberg air disaster is a clear example of where politicians interfered in the legal system .
finally , sir , i want to refer to the allan boesak case because it forms part of the motion .
i believe that this is a case in which the anc left allan boesak in the lurch .
] the reality is that that society sees it this way - the male should dominate .
the female should accept that , just as the hon minister of education accepts what she is saying .
the unfortunate thing is that in this country we have a de facto blurring of the roles .
" fortunately we did not have to sit with the apartheid group politics that he would have brought to us .
and we will continue to do it , because that is in the best interests of south africa .
mr speaker , this motion first appeared on the order paper on 28 february 2000 .
however , mr speaker , they cannot outdo the dp in this brand of politics , obviously not .
] let them play white oppositional politics , but our people need this nation to work .
he arrested a 17-year-old girl because she spoke out against republic day celebrations .
the new np believes in strong principled opposition , with the emphasis on " strong principled opposition " .
] the standpoint of the new np is very clear and that hon member knows it full well .
it is the institution she works for , the institution to which she applied for a home loan .
mr speaker , what will banks , and the dp and new np tell us today ?
" rent-a-darkie " is one of the most blunt names it has been called , or " rent-a-black " .
it is a " rent-a-white " system , because they cannot have access to white finance .
as i have already said , during recent hearings the business alliance explained what the problems were .
by contrast , the uk attracts more inward foreign investment than the whole european union combined .
if they go 70 % industrial and 30 % retail , the banks will assist them .
it has been unable to deliver , despite hundreds of millions of rands in funds .
ntsika was set up as the other national organisation to provide professional support services and expertise to small businesses .
there is no doubt that smmes from previously disadvantaged communities in south africa are at a major disadvantage .
firstly , yes , the banks in south africa are too conservative and too risk averse .
in fact , three provinces were supposed to be part of this - the eastern cape , the western cape and the northern cape .
] they had one fund in mpumalanga - it failed , it is gone , " klaar " , ta-ta !
the unauthorised expenditure amounting to r34 406,69 arising from excess expenditure on the vote was considered .
that notwithstanding the provisions of rule 181 , four interpellations be dealt with on 22 august 2000 -
mr speaker , as this is the first reading i intend being brief .
for example , hon members might find it confusing that the goodwood bid has been increased .
madam speaker , we all know the arguments of the past with the ratepayers of grassy park .
it will also be remembered that people in the townships paid moneys in lieu of rates .
let me tell them what the truth is and how they are misleading the voters with the propaganda war .
the hon member here will know that local government has a cap ceiling of 5 % .
madam speaker , nothing touches the ordinary citizens more than when they have to pay moneys in taxes .
rather , it eats up most of the revenue collected on salaries and administration costs .
those are ordinary , hardworking south africans who simply cannot afford to carry such a burden .
] people owe worcester , that is true , but worcester does not owe anyone anything .
it will allow municipalities to levy different rates in different areas - that is their major concern .
it is quite clear what the dp wants in its quest to protect white privilege .
madam speaker , the anc has called for a world-class african city at the tip of the african continent .
that is why the anc is also saying that there must be a 20 to 60 amp electricity connection for each ...
we cannot work with the valuation roll of 1979 , as well as those of 1980 and 1990 .
it will be impossible to inspect each of the 600 000 plots in the metropolitan area .
if one looks at the regulatory authority of the minister , that is a reason for concern .
i appeal to all hon members not to bring the house into disrepute .
accordingly , my appeal is for closer cooperation among all spheres of government in order to address this problem .
there were a couple and a brother-in-law from rylands who had an ice cream shop in the strand .
mr september was assaulted with the spoke of an old oxwagon and chased off the farm .
they are part of the upsetting of the relationship because they are pumping the farm workers full of untruths and unnecessary things .
report of the ad hoc committee on the western cape fiscal policy , 2001- 2004 , dated 21 july 2000 , as follows :
( 3 ) urgently requests the anc government to introduce legislation to this effect without delay .
i feel that the hon minister of social services ' reaction does not constitute a withdrawal .
listening to the reasoning of the hon member mr dugmore , i have to concede his point .
i am prepared to accept such a reaction by a member as a form of withdrawal .
it is not my intention to detain hon members any further with anything more .
we need to consider all possible avenues to prevent over-stimulation of the latent demand for gambling .
mr speaker , i might take a little longer than the previous speaker on the speakers ' list !
in section 30.3.2 of the report mr van niekerk makes the following points , and i quote :
i think the council did not take the ordinances which regulate building and land development into consideration .
mr speaker , these issues were never resolved despite written undertakings to this effect .
the mayor is a fine gentleman , but we know that he is the hon premier 's neighbour .
] even the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs knows exactly what is happening there .
] it is not like their municipalities , where they tell people what to do .
they would surely not object to his wonderful affidavit that does not spell out his family trust interests .
" he did not say that the hon member was lying .
my questions are as follows : did convenco discuss the grading of hotels as part of their function ?
two years ago they said to me , " dad , do you need it in your life ?
that is quite evident - especially from some of the speeches made by previous speakers .
that the house congratulates amaglug-glug for beating brazil 3-1 at the olympic games in sydney , australia .
when an important person like the hon premier appeared in public , where were the intelligence services ?
i wish to refer to what the hon leader of the opposition said on 27 august 1998 .
we owe it to our people , our province and our country to check this wave .
i listened to the introductory speech by the hon member mr n m isaacs on his motion .
this need was tragically illustrated by the assassination of the magistrate , pieter theron .
i certainly think that it will ensure the maximum opportunity to assist with the saps investigations .
at dysselsdorp there have been several complaints about the management and handling of the old-age home there .
perhaps it is not racial preference , and they rather chose the more competent people for those positions .
i am an african too , but yet people say there are no africans in the cabinet .
if they cannot answer that , they are still racist , just like the boere of old .
the differences between their communities and those who have been privileged in the past are still very great .
i will not define them simply as " african " because they are a little confused .
in fact , mr speaker , the only people who clearly seem to thrive on it are the anc .
it is quite obvious that " wit gevaar " tactics will be the theme tune of their election campaign .
notes the racism , whether specific or by implication , which still prevails in the western cape ; ...
anyone else must filter up , percolate up through the establishment of lites .
they said that he was travelling the world while his country was on fire .
such transformation should ideally reflect the demographics of the people and should be qualitative rather than quantitative .
( 2 ) encourages other corporate institutions to follow suit in the fight against aids .
( 5 ) expresses the hope that this province will continue being the shining star in the matric heaven .
- r37,8 million , which pertains to road projects ; and - r50,5 million for works , capital and maintenance projects .
we have taken note of that and regard it as a point of order by the hon member .
mr speaker , in moving this motion we are really asking two particular things of the house .
] surely the hon member mr dugmore knows that they are not going to fare well in the elections .
the chair is not going to rule on interjections that are not part of the debate ...
unless they interfere with the main debate , and i do not think that it did .

for the information of the hon member mr gelderblom , it has everything to do with reality ...
the provincial government is trying to ensure that the state land in this province remains in white hands .
mr speaker , i want to read to the house what mr botha said in his declaration .
in the pamphlet they say that i say , " everything is fine with farm workers in the western cape .
i said that we should stop talking and for once do something positive about farm workers and ...
the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs knows that that is not a point of order .
( i ) notification in terms of rule 134 of the standing rules of the western cape provincial parliament , as follows :
the committee recommends that the amount of r1 088 417,40 be authorised by the provincial parliament .
" . this means that the nhls bill , as well as any changes in tariffs , must be discussed at the budget council .
( i ) firearms control bill [ b34b-2000 ] .
during these financial years , the provincial administration considered the r5 collection to be an agency fee ; and
subsequent steps enabled the recovery of all amounts but r2 190 of the amount .
if this amounts to direct questioning of rulings then that must be by way of a substantive motion .
the hon minister of social services and poverty relief should rather not argue along those lines .
i think that the chair has a duty , when the chair sees that a question is repetitive ...
no , the hon member mr fransman also cannot ask questions without first asking permission .
we have introduced a better system of financial reporting inclusive of a more structured approach to contingent liabilities .
the environmental and cultural affairs and sport vote has received r442 000 towards the establishment of the nature conservation board .
in some cases people have to return home without receiving the necessary medical attention .
that was the downfall of p w botha - his starting to criticise the press .
i need only mention zimbabwe and what is happening there as far as the media are concerned .
we are going to see support moving away from the anc in greater and greater measure .
our voters have recognised the efficient manner in which this province has been managed and will continue to be managed .
for the first time south africa 's opposition party is a true rainbow party , attracting support from all population groups .
] we can still get them back to the polls , and then the da is finished !
they packed up and moved their head office from johannesburg - even their ryan coetzees , all of them .
there were about 14 hung councils where negotiations had to take place .
we told the hon premier about the corruption in his backyard , the constituency that he comes from .
he made the rest of them weak , and so there is no longer an nnp .
the da rejects it with the contempt it deserves , and the voters out there know that .
mr speaker , on a point of order : unfortunately i now have to appeal to the chair .
mr speaker , the first respondent in the constitutional court case was the central government .
was that the anc 's judge in the high court , mr justice davis , said that we were not ...
oh please , it was after i had gone blue in the face in minmec begging for it to be introduced .
the joining together of people with the same value systems under one umbrella has unleashed a new enthusiasm and inspiration .
that enthusiasm will attract even the supporters of the anc and persuade them that there is still hope .
so , too , my portfolios will indeed - and must - be functional for the people of the western cape .
in this regard i can only endorse the call by the hon premier for unity in service delivery .
i would really like him to do something about the security of the people in manenberg .
again , i pose the challenge that we as a house go to manenberg collectively .
we all know that the nnp was only saved because it joined forces with the dp .
they were looking for so-called coloured voters , but the party is still run by white people .
the station commissioner has also pointed out that a number of senior officials simply clock in in the morning and then leave .
mr speaker , there is a serious increase in crime in our townships , especially amongst our youth .
the clanwilliam secondary school had a 72 % pass rate , but only 10 students passed with exemptions .
a study has shown that the agricultural debt in worcester at only one banking institution is about r0,5 billion .
mr speaker , the last objective is to market the province as the gateway to africa .
they read the history of what happened and then come here and talk about the struggle .
] yes , the hon member mr mckenzie promised them that he would take bonteheuwel with him .
mr speaker , i am proud to be a member of this side of the house .
mr speaker , i am a proud member of the anc on this side of the house .
minmec meetings would be cancelled or postponed with a day or two 's notice .
minmec must function properly , particularly if we want to establish a national strategy for local government .
an amount such as r105 000 is not a lot of money , because the mayor played a prominent ceremonial role there .
the anc will have to accept that , and , in certain respects , the da and the other parties as well .
we had the election for the unicity council , and after that also the election of the executive committee .
( 1 ) the involvement of the former minister of community safety in the awarding of the tender ;
i wish to address a special word of congratulations to the hon minister of social services and poverty management .
i thank the hon minister of local government and development planning for refuting this distorted picture .
i would also like to thank the hon minister of health for his exposition on my hiv / aids theme .
this government delivers to those people and we deliver like no other government in south africa delivers .
the mother rejected the offer when she discovered that the school did not offer art .
i have not been able to speak to mr ritchie about this , but i am going to bring it to his attention .
i want to say to the hon minister that the anc will be keeping a very close eye on events in the wced .
however , members of parliament cannot fulfil this task without the sufficient support and research service .
we would like to congratulate the hon premier on his achievements with the regional governments of bavaria and upper austria .
we need to explore the common history , culture , language , time zones and seasonal influences that can play a role .
for example , the hon premier did not refer once in his opening address to the 100-day programme .
" wanneer hy van oos-kapenaars praat , is dit ' n nuwe uitdrukking vir ' kaffers ' " ...
a mere 5 % indicated that they would prefer to move to another province .
to this end , we would like to encourage a transformation , gender , disability , youth and aids-sensitive budget .
much has been said in this debate about the issue of protecting our multiparty democracy .
i was in the underground , i was in exile and i was hounded by the hon premier 's security police .
] key officials in the office of the premier and the office of the director-general are running this campaign .
for the benefit of the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism , the question therefore is whether ...
it is a shame that a teacher has to struggle with 60 to 70 children in a class .
the hon minister who fought for it is sitting on the other side today and he is criticising it .
it is a crying shame that he has used the iec and drawn it into politics .
how can the iec be led by the nose into becoming part of a political debate ?
did he forget about guguletu , or was it because no one in guguletu voted for him ?
the natural environment of this province is its most valuable asset , yet the environmental portfolio is severely underfunded .
] there are other issues that this government is grappling with and which we will debate in the house .
mr speaker , let me conclude by saying that we are all proud of our province .
] they need assistance and we should not be selective when we do our work .
fifthly , the widespread social stigma and many forms of discrimination must be addressed .
mr speaker , i want to conclude with walking the talk concerning poverty .
mr speaker , it is an honour to follow the hon member dr van zyl .
do they realise that 87 % of the people voted against the dp in the past election ?
] when they make speeches for the gallery they must speak the truth about the issues .
but it is presently dysfunctional , with weak , tired leaders walking before their people without a vision .
] that is the kind of security that the new np is giving the people of the province .
] so the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism should be careful in what he says .
i want to congratulate the hon premier on his initiative of taking the cabinet to the community .
now they want those people to become executive mayors and take decisions on behalf of the entire community .
mr speaker , this province is , after all , also responsible for the expenditure of money .
the national minister of home affairs announced that all people had to have the new bar-coded identity document .
not so long ago a mr neil le roux of gardens , cape town had a burglary .
we still do not know why the people were paid and why volunteers were not used .
mr speaker , i want to come back to the speech which the hon premier delivered earlier this week .
the successes of the past year are clearly set out in the hon premier 's message .
good , cooperative coalition government ensures that the matters enjoying the attention of cabinet members are dealt with efficiently and thoroughly .
i interpret this idea as meaning that the hon premier expects more inputs from the public out there .
mr speaker , i cannot explain a position in the house as if nothing were going on out there .
the new np and the dp really wanted some of them in the coalition government too .
we hear what the poor say and we try to deliver clean , accountable government to them .
i wish the farm school pupils of the eastern cape could have been there to witness the scene .
at the press club commissioner max said - and not a word from the anc after that :
he said that there were more police vehicles at eendekuil than there were in bishop lavis .
did hon members know that bishop lavis has 22 vehicles and eendekuil has three , of which only one works ?
actually , i am not surprised that the hon premier said nothing about hiv / aids .
the hon member ms brown was quick to recount what she had experienced .
the function was held in the municipal offices , but during church time , and the whole street was closed .
and disunity in south africa between employee and employer in agriculture and in the manufacturing sector .
if those permits were only granted , they would be able to lighten their burden .
in terms of budgetary constraints , this has been the most testing year the health branch has ever faced .
we know that the frustration is aggravated by the fact that extremely important election promises have not been kept .
the new np / dp coalition has the habit of saying that the anc should keep quiet about racism .
this was a display of typical new np / dp eurocentric values - what a waste of words .
this meant the loss of almost 200 jobs or half the company 's cape town workforce .
where are all the big promises from the anc to rectify this situation ?
mr speaker , there has been no improvement in the professional competence and effectiveness of the police service .
the hon premier showed us that he really cares about the people of the western cape .
but south africa has neither hands nor feet nor a brain .
madam speaker , let me return to the obstacles in the path of farmers in the western cape .
we have witnessed dramatic events here since the opening of the provincial parliament on 8 february 2000 .
let me deal with the issue of the colour line , and the challenge that the president issued .
the glowing example , if i can use the word " glowing " so inappropriately , is the eastern cape .
that is why he went over there as the opportunist that i believe he is .
to empower the poor people of our province through the provision of basic services .
there are severe constraints on provincial budgeting on both the revenue and the expenditure sides of the balance sheet .
we are seriously tackling the number and quantum of debtors and improved our cash management procedures .
the political democracy which dawned in 1994 placed tremendous burdens on the nine newly established provinces .
national land transport transition bill [ b 5-2000 ] .
to cater for proper in-depth deliberations , 2 190 minutes will be required next year , excluding meal-time breaks .
under the heading , " vote 1 : premier , director-general and corporate services " , i quote the second paragraph :
mr speaker , we would like to praise the officials , more especially the officials of the department of finance .
mr speaker , the budget is the product of the medium term expenditure framework for the province and national government .
mr speaker , they now tell us that it is not voter registration ; it is an id campaign .
sir , i could also just say to the hon member mr ozinsky that he should take care .
he therefore saw fit to complain that only r10 million had been set aside for poverty relief .
figures on which this statement were based are further confirmed by prominent and highly respected academics .
i echo his sentiments about the lack of infrastructure and service support for the standing committee .
the hon minister in the office of the premier admitted that she has no plans .
mr speaker , it is indeed a great privilege to be able to take part in this debate today .
mr speaker , our first priority as legislators in this province is to be protectors of the people .
in the white book under the column " actual " an amount of r1 000 appears .
on the one hand they preach one thing and on the other hand they do something else .
the hon minister seems to have prepared his speech in anticipation of speaking after me .
] we believe that the medium term expenditure framework is a collective brainchild of all provinces and the national government .
mr speaker , my standing here to speak is basically to motivate the anc 's support for the budget .
now the national minister of finance has taken an international departure tax and included that at central government level .
i think the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism mentioned it in his speech as well .
the hon member did not say that and it was not included in his speech .
i sincerely hope that we will be receiving supportive and constructive inputs from the anc in this regard .
all men , as the traditional and historic protectors of women , should stand up for the rights of women .
i believe that the root of the cancer which seems to have infected so many lies in their disrespect for women .
the total possible recoveries amount to approximately r5 million although the recoveries are at various stages of collection .
it seems the standards being applied by sa statistics are resulting in us being more the poor .
madam chairperson , the 1999-2000 budget is r133 million less than it ought to be as a result of the census statistics .
this was the directive and instruction that the consultant would have had , if he had been appointed .
] that is what i call transparency , accountability and responsibility with regard to the electorate out there .
if the new technology can be transferred to the people at grassroots level then this could hold out unparalleled training possibilities .
drafting new laws requires highly specialised skills , seldom found outside the public service .
no significant adjustment of the organisation and the establishment is implemented before this group of experts is consulted .
her concern was not only for her personal safety , but also for that of her family .
the theft of pharmaceutical stock is of great concern , because it is organised through syndicates .
firstly , it presumes that racial criteria should be the overriding factor in appointing and promoting individuals .
fraud syndicates have now been uncovered , particularly in the areas of medical losses , and the resulting savings are to be welcomed .
the young people in this province should not receive only the leftovers from other departments .
the department had been given r3 million , and we asked that they be given more money .
for the information of the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation , i will continue to raise this issue .
this gives me a clear understanding as to why we feel that affirmative action will harm this province .
i think of a province like mpumalanga , where the incidence of malaria is very high and on the increase .
mr chairperson , i believe that you have to put your foot down when it comes to that type of thing .
it does not matter what those hon members say , or what authority they go to .
] the hon member also made another statement , and that shows how confused she is .
this allocation is over and above the administrative amount of r1 129 budgeted for committee work .
it is also a pleasure to announce that we have brought about considerable improvements as far as members ' privileges are concerned .
our staff , the smallest number of all legislature staffs , work under extreme pressure from time to time .
attempts are again being made to involve the university of cape town and the university of the western cape as well .
we certainly have headaches , and often the perceptions that arise out of these awful headaches later turn into myths .
it is a myth that the parliament of the western cape is an annex to the provincial administration .
there has been wide-ranging discussion here recently on the role of the committee system in our parliament .
we must again commend the officials working on this matter with the deputy speaker .
staff salaries are not in line with those at the national parliament or , on average , those at other legislatures .
madam chairperson , it is a privilege to take part in the debate on vote 2 .
the hon member mr ramatlakane said that he had mixed feelings about taking part in this debate .
we know , therefore , why we have this clustering of committees to the extent that we have it .
madam chairperson , i want to thank all those who took part in the debate most sincerely for their contributions .
we are already moving in that direction with briefings to the different standing committees before the debates .
what i mentioned with regard to the third reading and the committee stage is closely linked to this .
when we process a bill , the emphasis should be on the standing committee dealing with the bill .
the hon member mr ramatlakane referred to the relationship between the parliament and the executive .
as hon members know , we have negotiated the formula and we have quite a good solution at the moment .
we are already sharing cape town with the national parliament , and we are now going to have this huge local government institution .
i quote the hon minister 's head of department , dr jocelyn kane-berman , on this matter when she says :
the hon minister now wants to come here and mislead us and say that it is something else .
the provincial government has not received a letter from the iec requesting such assistance .
how many times do i have to say in this house that home affairs and the iec act independently ?
] he is not doing so himself , but through the independent organs of state that are available .
on 20 november 1999 , 120 informal structures burnt down at the or tambo informal settlement in wellington .
the municipality of wellington is administering them , and the moment they have been returned , the amounts will be paid .
mr speaker , is it absolutely clear now that the current redeployment rules and regulations apply ?
that school has been so badly racked with conflict that not one single promotion post has been able to be filled .
in the meantime , the draft legislation has been circulated to the departments of health , of education and of sport and recreation .
( b ) the 1997-98 report was tabled in the provincial parliament on 23 june 1998 .
i would like to argue that it was tabled today because this interpellation is on the question paper .
( 1 ) what is the zoning of the land on which the four houses at grotto bay beach stand ;
as yet i have not seen any written replies on the table or received them from any hon minister .
as i understand the process , the public service has to nominate its candidates to this board of stakeholders .
mr speaker , i would like to find out from the hon minister why we do not fund artscape .
with the permission of the house , may they please put their questions to the hon premier first ?
my question is : which of these formal requests from the heath commission has the hon premier agreed to ?
i do not think that is the purpose of the session for questions to the hon premier .
in this regard the south african police service act gave him specific powers .
the point is that the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation did nothing about it .
in this regard i call to mind in particular cases such as those of thabo mabaso and niel van heerden .
in cases where i could apply equal treatment , all of a sudden he maintains that i am racist .
did the hon member ms essop call the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation a racist ?
( 2 ) what steps have been taken by the pawc to enforce these conditions ; and
( 2 ) no steps as the agreement was concluded with the knowledge of the council .
mr speaker , in this country the government says that it is in favour of cooperative government .
] you will have your chance to ask a question , missy , you will get your chance .
government has been overtaken by corruption , nepotism and cronyism , and the world knows about that .
no. if the hon member wants me to answer her , then she must please listen .
it might not be the answer that hon members want , but it is an answer .
the second response was that frieda adams was investigating herself , but that there was an investigation .
a brutal person is someone who finds joy in another 's pain - a merciless cruel person .
this can perhaps be ascribed to the extraordinary situation of agriculture , in which owners and workers live on the same land .
for example , in the department of local government , planning and housing we have 35 white men in senior management positions .
mr speaker , the hon member ms essop is doing precisely what i expected her to do .
we will have to obtain a legal opinion about that , because the anc 's racist slip is showing again .
she said that they had implemented transformation and affirmative action too quickly , and everything was therefore collapsing .
the hon minister must tell us how come he did not know about this .
these include , firstly , a mediation process being undertaken by the centre for conflict resolution .
there was a time when i was really suspicious of the anc , and i want to be honest about this .
on 16 may 2000 the western cape road transportation act amendment bill [ b7b-2000 ] was passed .
the question i am still asking is whether the government in the province supports the be legal campaign .
the hon minister said that we were not going to follow what the national government said .
similarly by october over 200 neighbourhood watch trainers will have been intensively coached to mobilise their communities .
mr speaker , if i could just repeat the second question which has escaped the hon minister .
the finalisation of the reports was delayed because the format of the reports has only been completed recently .
mr speaker , the question relates to two sets of regulations , the planning review board regulations and the general regulations .
mr speaker , this parliament is situated in the republic of south africa which has a constitution ...
i appeal to the hon member mr ozinsky to abide by the constitution .
if we debate the point , the hon member mr ozinsky will be able to put his view .
these projects range from very small school and community gardens to much larger commercial enterprises , which are scattered all over the province .
mr speaker , i think that the visit was largely financial in nature and not just about management support .
the hon ministers must deliver their answers to the table to be taken up in hansard .
let me first explain the procedure available to personnel that feels he or she is discriminated against .
two avenues are open of which one is for individual and the other collective action .
again , the long waiting times at phc level reflect a health service stretched to capacity .
the cape town railway station has a 24-hour reporting point where police members are employed on a 24-hour basis for crime prevention purposes .
the model agreement is based on income kilometres and not on the multi-journey ticket that determines the current contract .
these regulations , together with the act , establish the legal framework within which the preferential procurement policy must be implemented .
the groundwork could have been put in place , but up to today we still do not have a policy .
the hon member ms essop indicated that she was tired of waiting for me .
( b ) as far as pharmacy support staff are concerned , we do have 160 posts , of which 11 posts are vacant .
the remuneration of pharmacists is now being reconsidered by the national department of health at the national bargaining chamber .
mr speaker , yes , clinics and day hospitals are entitled to use a booking system .
some clinics or day hospitals do make use of the booking system and obviously it will create a problem .
( 3 ) what steps have been taken to address the shortage of medicines at health facilities ?
mr speaker , i have spelt out that it is a relationship between the employer and the employee .
persons are not always willing to acknowledge / indicate that they are disabled .
a working conference was co-hosted with the department of social services on the transformation of protective workshops .
the disability desk is currently part of the working group towards formulation of a working manual for protective workshops .
first biennial exhibition and conference on assistive devices , mobility , rehabilitation and information technology are currently in the tender process .
( 1 ) yes , the imc on aids is still functioning under the chairpersonship of the hon minister of social services .
mr speaker , i do not accept that the words were as the questioner has put them .
mr speaker , the people may have been confused because the logos appeared on the material .
pricewaterhousecoopers carried out a study and recommended that an additional post under that of town clerk was necessary .
this is an estimate and it includes all the clinics , day hospitals and hospitals of the western cape .
it was approved in 1997 but implementation started in may 1998 .
at present all indications are that we shall use staff to do the adjustment in-house .
what he is trying to ask is , " did you pay to get that advert or the awards ?
that is about 9 % or 10 % more than we had in the 1999 elections .
the coalition is 18 months down the road , and not only going strong but gaining momentum !
he ate , drank and slept transformation 2000 , and brought the process to where it is now .
our reward of r1 million was paid for information which brought the perpetrators to book .
mr speaker , all our successes notwithstanding , we must remain constantly vigilant and increase our efforts .
we are targeting growing sectors , as well as those which will retain and create more jobs .
the eight tourist regions in the province represented in our opening ceremony this morning symbolise our commitment to this .
our aim is to make the western cape more welcoming , more popular and more enjoyable than ever before .
she and her department are working ceaselessly to continue improving the quality of education in our province .
i call on hon members to remain standing as the procession leaves the house .
another point we wanted to discuss was the r10 million allocated to poverty relief .
however , i can tell hon members that things went very well up to that point .
i breathed down the hon minister 's neck about a project that i wanted to see carried through .
now , in february 2001 , scof is still dealing with the roll-over funds for this item .
we want the details of that smoking gun , and we are not going to let it rest .
] we will not be deterred from delivering to all our people in the province .
] the auction of patrick promises has been another dismal failure , and at what price ?
mr speaker , i also told him that we needed inclusivity in the province .
mr speaker , on a point of order : can the hon premier say a person has lied ?
i will withdraw it from the record , that is all . i would say it outside .
it is becoming clear to me that he is addressing a point which is not on the order paper .
this work should be completed by 30 june 2000 , if it is not already complete .
hon members will remember that the last promise was made in this house on 1 december 1998 .
about r500 000 of this money was spent directly on damage caused by vandalism at about 110 schools .
the western cape education department also has a minor unscheduled maintenance programme and for the year 1999-2000 it was r17 million .
my answer to the question is , yes , because 15 of them have already been taken into the saps .
( 2 ) whether he intends taking any further steps in this regard ?
it is most fitting that the hon minister , as the minister of tourism , should convey our congratulations .
what exactly is this market-related rental which the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism has spoken about ?
shares on nasdaq a few days ago were worth 25 % more than they are today .
] perhaps some of my other colleagues in the house who were there at the time may know better .
the flight of the hon minister of transport and works from overseas has apparently not landed on time .
( 2 ) commits itself to sparing no effort to ensure that -
the light years between the haves and the have-nots are increasing .
their forefathers came onto south african soil with the bible in their hands , while we had the land .
] those provincial service commissioners have now been taken up in the national public service commission and they are not aware of this .
the hon member mr isaacs stood up yesterday and said that it was not functioning properly at all .
scof has expressed concern at the costs of the failure or partial failure of the hospital information systems tender .
we need to go much further than the hon minister of finance and development planning is suggesting .
madam chairperson , it gives me great pleasure to enter this important debate today .
in 1994 we created nine provinces , but we gave them precious little power and authority .
i want to thank dr stegmann and his whole department of finance for a job well done .
" i replied , " well , even if you just say thank you to them , then you have done the right thing .
we are pleased that someone has finally accepted that we were right and remain right as the anc .
this training ensures that norms and standards are maintained in accordance with the prescriptions of the public service act .
we therefore already have visible training aimed at making us acquainted with this law .
in the request for proposals from our gambling board , the position was made very clear , and i quote :
what this document does do is that it names the main contractors in the development of the casino .
that hon member has at least had the courage of his convictions and addressed the point .
they cannot tell me that we do not have one coloured or white steel fixer in the western cape .
hon members will not find one western cape coloured , black or white steel fixer , carpenter , and so forth .
sooner or later the hon minster will come up with legislation so that we can have our own procurement law .
] we would have to introduce taxes to do so , and the hon member did not complain ...
also i might just add something , in so far as the employment policy is concerned , or - my apologies - the preference policy .
zwelinzima vavi - hon members might find this interesting - who is the general-secretary of cosatu , ...
meyer kahn suggested exactly the same , but he failed to implement them .
there were 1 603 arrests , inter alia 40 for murder and 39 for rape and 176 for assault .
this was organised in conjunction with my department by the bellville community police forum and paid for by the department .
the department has developed both the quarterly monitoring brief and the in loco inspection models to perform this function .
the cape town inner city forum took on the responsibility to tackle the challenges of safety within the cbd .
i want to tell the hon minister that we appreciate the way in which he is doing this .
the one " horse " is dying ; the other " horse " is feeding on it and hastening its demise .
i am a member of the forville guard neighbourhood watch in blue downs , and the experience in this regard has been written up in practice .
this is an absolutely critical leg of our activities and the hon minister confirmed that .
how does the selection take place - is there a process of submitting inputs , and how does this take place ?
what is the role of politicians in this regard - do they make inputs and are they part of the programme ?
we cannot do this in the province , but the anc can do this at the national level .
the anc have spent five years failing every citizen of this country .
the udm will do everything in its power to help the chrysalis project to come into its own .
if we do not consider our youth , then we shall be undermining our entire future .
on behalf of us on this side of the house i sincerely want to thank the hon minister and his management team .
for that reason it is essential that the central government urgently make more money available for policing in the western cape .
it is amazing what a good sleep can do when one is feeling peaceful about a decision .
we see his commitment , his ardent dedication to the programmes and the department that fall under this vote .
in particular , we are pleased to see that he is spending a large amount of money in the 2000-01 financial year on training and coordination .
it would also be welcomed if the hon minister could furnish us with more details of his process research .
madam chairperson , i would like to congratulate the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation on the delivery of his budget speech .
at the time we were discouraged by all the things happening to us , the past era .
the fact that i assisted with the transformation in a recommendation capacity is irrelevant .
of my own department , 50 % are female , 50 % are male and 50 % happen to be people of colour .
the hon member mr silke referred to the role of justice and correctional services in the criminal justice system .
the fact of the matter is that madam is not meant to have a high profile .
the hon member mr gelderblom referred to cattle theft , particularly ostrich eggs and chickens , in the oudtshoorn region .
this database shows that while there are enough facilities per capita numerically , they are not evenly spread .
we must try to encourage every sport code to have a mass participation capacity such as this .
the sport against crime campaign is also very successful in assisting in the fight against crime , as i previously mentioned .
mr chairperson , today i should like to thank all sports administrators for what they mean for sport in south africa .
i am ashamed that nothing is being said about young people in the hon minister 's report .
of this r4,53 million , an amount of r1,651 million goes to personnel and only r1,515 million to development .
i do believe that there is an intention to develop a sport magazine , sport marketing strategies and even a recreational trust .
it is my considered view that the wced has to promote the concept of physical education and school sports quite vigorously .
it is a pity that last week we encountered once again the hard realities of racism in the context of sport .
we do take this exceptionally seriously indeed , and we would like to see something solid come from this .
and if we stumble or falter , we do our best to set things right as quickly as possible .
but i believe that we need to instil in all our people an even greater pride in their province .
other areas of cooperation in the fields of environmental education , communication , research and development will also be finalised then .
it is therefore essential that our natural assets must be well managed in this fine province of ours .
i have already shared some plans with the national minister of water affairs and forestry in this regard .
in the words of the 1998 triple inquiry report of the iba to parliament , and i quote :
i too , publicly and in the ncop , have called for the death penalty for murderers and rapists .
newspaper editor jon qwelane says the crystal ball does not show much promise for the african continent in the 21st century .
having said this , i want to emphasise that i too believe in president mbeki 's african renaissance .
bills and portfolio committee amendments received from national parliament and tabled by the speaker in terms of rule 192 :
he is today visiting clinics in the southern cape and has submitted his apologies for not being present .
some are recognised as being very good - even excellent - despite severe resource constraints and historical disadvantages .
if we are not honest about the problem we can never find sustainable solutions .
madam chairperson , the successful combination of all of these factors is the challenge of management .
our fourth priority is to work towards our schools becoming safe environments for learning and teaching .
they have taken control of their situation and they have taken co-responsibility for improving their circumstances .
it does not help if our students become good at sport , but are not functionally literate and numerate .
mr chairperson , we have now developed a full primary school curriculum and the training of the master trainers has commenced .
this is some r10 million up on last year , but this is still not nearly enough .
in some areas the success of the strategy has been clearly evident and gangsterism and violent crime have been significantly reduced .
a crucial aspect of our infrastructural development focus is to improve access to information and communication technologies in schools .
the khanya project will require a lot of effort and its aims will be very difficult to achieve .
the hanepoot are in table grape form and unfortunately they are not in a processed form in bottles .
the hon member mr gabru also received a special box of grapes for the hon minister of education .
in the fifth place the present five improvement schools , which currently accommodate a mere 225 pupils , are to be closed .
as a result , the time between decision and implementation is too short to attend to matters of quality .
the reform school process which has been mentioned , so i will not go over it myself , is one example .
it is going to take a long time , and it is going to take the participation of all the role-players .
a few problem areas that need some attention are , firstly , curriculum 2005 and outcomes-based education .
in the previous term the wced followed the policy that all schools were funded on the same basis .
i do not believe that we shall ever be able to bridge the gap caused by apartheid in our educational institutions .
thirdly , i would like to speak to the hon minister about moral standards and discipline in our schools .
indeed , some of the section 21 schools can almost be regarded as private schools accommodated in state buildings .
because of the socio-economic problems in this school , the community has started a campaign to assist them .
these learners are from the disadvantaged communities and my conclusion is that she is less interested in their education .
whether or not this is true , the fact remains that the school system has come under a great deal of scrutiny .
since its inception in 1976 it has been , and still is , blessed with gifted and dedicated teachers .
when the costs were computed it ran into hundreds of millions of rands , which is completely unaffordable in our country .
certainly , there are hundreds of principals in the western cape and thousands of teachers who would agree with the hon member .
at our request a work study investigation is currently being carried out to establish an appropriate new management structure for the chso .
the elsies river , khayelitsha , hanover park and dr abduragman clinics will all benefit by paintwork and repair work as a result of this money .
reading her speeches in hansard strengthened me in carrying this worthy torch forward .
i think it was you , madam chairperson , who expressed concern about the location of the centre .
he became a mere statistic , a victim of our system of patient referral gone horribly wrong .
we will be starting this financial year with 3 000 fewer personnel and 900 fewer beds than the previous year .
he said then that he would undertake to , and i want to quote him on this from p 315 :
in this speech he decries the fact that only 100 new diploma nursing students have been registered .
i have mentioned the issue of nursing and the fact that 1 000 nurses are needed .
that is why we are rolling out initiatives to have voluntary testing and determining targets for that .
i think that they are very important and i will ask the department to deal with them .
i can tell the hon member ms phenduka that i have been to site b and site c hospitals .
firstly , i want to mention the definition we use when we look at the regions .
most people have excellent policies on the table , but nothing really happens in respect of street children .
of these arrests , 1 100 are carried out in the metropolitan area and the rest outside the metropolitan area .
i also want to refer to a multipurpose-centre programme that has been operational in the western cape .
in 1997 it was agreed with the red cross association and local authorities that they would give the necessary assistance .
that will be replaced by a child support grant , although i do not think that it can be replaced fully .
i therefore could not tell scof or stand here and say that there is a business plan .
in this regard i must tell hon members that yesterday a delegation came here from beaufort west .
the first of these areas , and the hon minister has already referred to them , is the issue of maintenance grants .
wherever there were women 's groups , they called us in to discuss the issue of maintenance grants .
it is like climbing a sand dune - one step forward and two steps back .
- the establishment of a help-line in aid of persons which are being discriminated against in terms of gender ; and
she said , moreover , and i quote from hansard : western cape , 6 september 1999 , vol 2 , p 132 :
] perhaps , madam chairperson , they actually mean , " slow and unsure is freda adams ' style " .
once again the facts mentioned by the hon member ms essop are not correct .
much has been said by the various hon members ; they did not stick to one point only .
you mentioned the fact that we might look at other departments and their involvement .
this project , which consists of 5 147 residential units , represents an investment of more than r92 million in housing funds .
it is expected that all the houses in wesbank will be occupied by the end of july 2000 .
my officials have already advertised for development proposals for the compilation of a five-year strategic housing delivery plan and a two-year business plan .
the first project of this nature was approved in grabouw after the fires devastated the informal settlement area .
it may be mentioned , however , that some cases involving possible fraud have come to our attention .
these cases have all been referred to the heath commission at my insistence , and we are now waiting for feedback .
the response was very disappointing and it was decided not to accept any of the applications .
local governments are forced to enforce credit control procedures and see to it that the outstanding debts are recovered .
madam chairperson , the days of receiving houses gratis and for nothing will very soon be something of the past .
this will ensure adequate site supervision and that dwellings are completed in terms of the plans and specifications of the contract .
i cannot be harsh in my criticism because the hon minister is really doing the best he can .
i know that the regulations have not been promulgated , but the act was signed on 19 or 20 december .
it was an inquiry that cost r2 million , and the hon minister and the hon premier were aware of it .
there are 521 families suffering there , and they are waiting for the hon minister to do something .
i have to add a " but " , however , and i say that recognising the realities according to which we have to live .
i am talking about a five-bedroomed house , one which could cost between r70 000 and r100 000 on the market .
what is strange is that the provincial housing development board has no plan to recover this money .
madam chairperson , i have been working with the hon member mr n m isaacs for years .
we do not need that hon member to tell us how to do the work .
this is a critical situation not only in the western cape , but also in the rest of south africa .
in that regard , we have the cmip , which is continuous in nature and , in fact , in an annual cycle .
the executive committee of weclogo accepted it unanimously and i think we can now move forward with it .
each one will have an independent chairperson , and they will face a range of challenges .
the demarcation board gave us a preliminary report in which they had looked at all the new category c municipalities .
they say that it should apply not only to category 0 to category 3 , but to all staff .
another aspect that is on the table at the moment is that no immovable assets may be sold .
i want to give him an accolade , and those hon members should not try to prevent me from giving it to him .
the point is that i have learnt the game ; to keep those hon members on their toes .
no , i am now saying this unconditionally and unambiguously : we shall not form a coalition with the anc .
in the debate on the 100-day programme , you told us here that voter education would be provided .
one of the hon minister 's constitutional functions is to monitor the financial status of local government .
south peninsula , the wonderful homeland of the hon premier , has not produced its financial statements since 1996 .
the hon minister lives in his own world and he does not know the realities out there .
is it realistic to expect everyone to conform with the anc 's master plan in this regard ?
madam chairperson , in this regard it would be vital for local authorities to change the income and expenditure patterns .
as a result , r9,2 million of the r13,7 million voted goes to personnel salaries in the province .
this bypassing of the provincial budgets has caused certain ministers not to be subject to provincial scrutiny .
at the outset i want to thank all hon members who took part in the debate for their contributions .
with regard to the general valuation , there are concerns , and i will express these concerns to the national government .
i still believe that the national legislation will be innovative enough to accommodate this .
there was an idea that they would either be incorporated with tygerberg or stand on their own .
we cannot point fingers at the municipalities of cape town , tygerberg or anywhere else .
i am also unable to do so for our own members , for anc members or for any other party .
bills and portfolio committee amendments received from national parliament and tabled by the speaker in terms of rule 208 :
bill and portfolio committee amendments received from national parliament and tabled by the speaker in terms of rule 208 :
firstly , a peer review panel consisting of nine specialists provided comment from a scientific perspective .
thirdly , the cape metropolitan council and mlcs , as well as district councils and local authorities , were approached for additional comment .
] the outcome of this study will play a major role in the future allocation of scarce resources .
it was in any case long before her time - i guess she is about 21 years of age .
much historical research has been done on the scale and nature of dispossession of farmers of colour of their land .
madam chairperson , with the introduction of the unicity all substructures will have to review their own structural plans .
this department is very unrealistic in many ways with the deadlines that it sets for itself .
as a result , the good intentions of the hon minister to speed up this process last year have been much delayed .
i also want to thank the hon minister that he has kept me informed of what is going on .
that is why i believe that if the review boards are going to look at these applications , politics needs to be out .
this province has no need to assail the autonomy of the local authorities .
what we should be doing is having proper processes and not making bad decisions .
the hon minister stressed this last year and it also has reference to the issue of the pdc .
the pdc is the organisation that represents civil society and that is currently involved in that process .
i believe that the office of the environmental commissioner will bring about greater confidence in decision-making in the province .
we shall change that and the cape coons will become one of the premier cultural events in the western cape .
the concept will , for example , be one conducted under the single heading " clean living " .
it was essential that environmental education should be a life-long process involving all the people all the time .
thirdly , environmental education should develop an attitude amongst people in pursuance of which they will demand that the environment is conserved .
mr chairperson , i am glad that you are in the chair and not speaking after me .
mr chairperson , on a point of order : the hon member is misleading the house .
i pointed out to the hon premier last week that the hon minister had misused his public office .
within three years about 250 000 south africans are expected to die each year of aids-related diseases .
therefore the role this department has to play is crucial in saving our young people and future generations .
what is the safety and security department doing to promote a culture of non-violence ?
before i see the hon member ms versfeld , i again request hon members to make short interjections .
madam chairperson , we now also have a dow jones for the environment , namely the living planet index .
we have an interesting organisation with no particular title , but it is called the tbhc .
madam speaker , i would like to respond to the various issues in the order they were raised .
he also seems to answer many questions , which makes it easier for me when i have to respond .
i consult with ngos continuously and they have an important role to play as far as this is concerned .
we can certainly look at having a contribution to the rationalisation process the hon member has spoken about .
she will remember that one of the kmos identified was tolerance and diversity in the western cape .
it was a cabinet decision on 20 october 1999 , where cabinet approved the closure , on our recommendation .
( 2 ) confirms that the symbolism against racism was evident during the tree planting ceremony on 21 march 2000 ;
on page 2 , in line 3 , to omit " substitution " , and to substitute " amendment " .
mr speaker , we allow them to move an amendment ; an amendment that permits ...
i do not regard the activities that hon members asked others to engage in as illegal .
mr speaker , it is really a pity that that hon member is seeking to engage in such cheap politics here today .
on p 2 , in line 10 , to omit " may " and to substitute " shall " .
the first bridge will be on the n1 at beaufort west , so that we can stop the heavy trucks there .
only r45,3 million is being provided for routine maintenance of gravel roads , and a mere r34,7 million is available for new gravel surfacing .
at the end of the 2000-01 financial year , the backlog in regard to new gravel surfacing is estimated at r134 million .
these tenders will include the new preference supply considerations for projects with a value of less than r2 million .
the announcement of the system of personalised and discrete registration plates on 1 september 1999 was a giant success .
works will act as facility manager for all client departments .
the white paper that the hon member mr ramatlakane prepared regarding transport stated , and i quote :
in december 1999 all the councils got together and said they were going to work towards the mta .
i know it is a sensitive topic , but advertising along proclaimed roads is always something that comes up .
i believe that very few hon members in the house actually understand the enormous role that works plays .
mr jakkie van heerden stated that the accommodation document would be completed by the end of the month .
to tell the truth , the tenders have already closed and within two months the construction work must begin .
changing the name from public works to works demonstrates clearly the non-commitment by the cabinet to job creation .
they should further consolidate the fragmented public works functions of the three departments under transport and public works forthwith .
the said strategy , if implemented , would go a long way towards addressing this matter in the province .
] in brief , the implication is that if he has been guilty of a traffic offence , he first receives a courtesy letter .
] nor is it clearly spelt out in the legislation what they mean by " immobilisation " .
all of us who have rural constituencies know that our telephones do not stop ringing in the rainy and harvesting season .
the mountain farming community of porterville are unique in that they produce export proteas that can only be cultivated there .
if the dasklip pass can be upgraded , they will be standing in line to present a world competition .
i would like to comment on the proposed 12-point system that was mentioned in the newspapers in the past week .
but the licence fees were not increased on the basis of a thumb-suck .
thanks to their zeal and dedication over the past two weeks , festival-goers may feel free to visit the little karoo arts festival ...
this road carries extremely heavy traffic and heavy vehicles are using this road to an increasing extent .
over the past number of days i have encountered people throwing cigarette butts out of windows right and left .
i would like to know from the hon minister how the people will be empowered through these two tenders .
madam chairperson , while i am discussing funds , i also wish to refer to the increase in licence fees .
the hon member mr ramatlakane referred to the names , " works " and " public works " .
no matter what the name of the department is , we are still doing the work .
the department of works is a client-driven department - we do work for other departments in this administration .
( 2 ) ( a ) 152 companies on the abe list have been awarded contracts .
and if we have to use that r10 million to help there too , then we shall do so .
madam chairperson , the hon member mr ramatlakane also referred to new and upcoming consultants and contractors .
this act would have been implemented in august 1999 but as a result of certain problems this was postponed .
the hon member mr ismail referred to the point system and to the state vehicles that are now being marked .
i thank her for the speech she delivered and for what she said ...
] he says that the school has been vandalised because many people have access to the school grounds .
where they do not do this , small businesses are usually swept away by technological changes and limited competitive advantages .
i believe that the road ahead will be discussed at the first minmec meeting for this year scheduled for may .
madam chairperson , if we are going to deal with liquor policy we have to steer a course between these two different imperatives .
madam chairperson , while we are engaged with policy work , we must carry on with the programmes of government .
it is a very useful booklet and hon members are requested to use it in their constituencies .
it will also be useful in some instances with general business and not only tourism .
madam chairperson , i have kept the house informed throughout about the progress of the cape town international conference centre .
it is essentially happening because of changes in the global market , particularly in the restructuring of supermarkets in europe .
madam chairperson , when i quote these figures i only quote projects in which wesgro is directly involved .
we have budgeted r100 000 for the implementation of this project and it is reflected in the white book .
we have also initiated a pamphlet and poster project that will specifically focus on the economic impact of aids .
our services to the former category of particularly micro enterprises will increasingly be rendered in close cooperation with local authorities .
this is clearly an issue that should be on the agenda of decision-makers looking at local government restructuring .
four bidders have been shortlisted to submit their final bids to the province by 27 march 2000 .
" as the hon minister in the office of the premier always says , " trek dieselfde snaar !
we need to learn about economic reform , and we need to learn about the latest trends in privatisation and outsourcing .
when he walked out of there , he said , " capital gains tax is one of the first signs of disinvesting .
we need to come in , point to these people and say , " but listen , we must counteract these types of policy .
we spoke about it yesterday in relation to the portfolio of the hon minister of transport and works .
we need to show the metropolitan council that we are a government that abides by our word .
we need to generate revenue , and that is by bare dominiums , long-term leases or concessions .
thirdly , i just want to deal with the whole aspect of the audit regarding rentals and the rental audit in this department .
it was gratifying this morning to hear about the programmes which the hon minister already has in mind .
the western cape coalition government has committed itself to build and develop a strong and healthy economy .
if the western cape government does not yet have an africa desk , i believe that they should soon attend to this .
it was very unfortunate that there was only one hon minister in the house while he spoke .
no doubt , and the hon minister has referred to it , structural changes in those sectors are under way .
it is the hon minister who has fought a turf battle at the expense of this sector of our economy .
the green paper drawn up by the department contains important policy objectives and strategies and by and large we agree with them .
this is part of a r3,6 billion development by monex , and is already starting to evolve .
international business visitors usually stay less than two weeks , and have an average daily expenditure of more than r600 .
i am sorry that the hon member mr strachan is not happy with his visit to ireland .
regarding the article 28 certificates , i think the hon member knows the province as well as i do .
i want to tell the hon member mr r williams that it does not contain accommodation facilities of tygerberg .
that would have been the hon member 's responsibility as well , if he had been a cabinet minister of this province .
the hon member , like everybody else , is welcome to deal with that and to give his input .
the leader of the opposition wrote a letter to the hon premier on the occasion of the celebration of human rights day .
it follows logically that the volume of the agricultural products will vary a great deal , relatively speaking , and the prices even more .
the 2000-01 budget has been increased from r77,8 million to r84,7 million , which amounts to an increase of r6,9 million .
madam chairperson , i should like to report on the progress made with draft legislation on products of origin .
a rebate on diesel for farm use would therefore promote the competitiveness of the local agricultural sector and promote job creation .
it is praiseworthy to see how many initiatives are generated by the agriculturists to empower the farm workers .
to this end a ministerial delegation will visit botswana , kenya and tanzania at the end of this month .
the second way in which we are able to empower our people is through the legislative framework for products of origin .
the most important aspect of the promotion of manual labour is to retain job opportunities and preserve existing resources .
in the western cape alone the tobacco industry provides employment to 3 000 workers in the primary and secondary sector .
for this reason the western cape is actively collaborating with the national government in developing an efficient risk management strategy .
their tomato price has risen from an initial agreed price of 30 cents per kilogram to r1,50 per kilogram .
- to the national minister of agriculture and land affairs , where we can discuss the matter .
a large proportion of these people enjoy basic food security , as prescribed by the food and agriculture organisation of the un .
this decline in respect of rural development is the criterion with which to read the policy of the department .
madam , no housing project has been established for the hardworking farm workers and they have no access to property .
i shall not weep , but i am heartsore because those hon members are misusing the farm workers ...
the budget of the hon minister of agriculture is in line with the latest technology of agriculture and with first world standards .
if the hon minister is not going to do something about it , what are we going to do with our local markets ?
today i should like to present two life sketches to this house , that of bokkie plaatjies and nick botha .
kerneels served in the second world war and in return for that received the farm with implements .
hon members must bear in mind that if it is difficult for commercial farmers to make a living ...
we gave them this anthology , dairy farming - a practical manual which was written for beginner farmers .
madam chairperson , i have heard hon members on the other side of the house talk about coloured reserves .
madam chairperson , i believe that in october this year we shall be airing the debate on minimum wages again .
the moneys budgeted for under vote 4 , programme 2 , subprogramme 2 : provincial crime prevention initiatives , deal with the payment of community police officers .
we are voting on each of votes in the schedule after being in committee stage for two weeks .
if hon members want to raise an objection , they must do so here and the objection is noted .
] the objection in vote 4 was in regard to the legality of payment of the community police officers .
bills and portfolio committee amendments received from national parliament and tabled by the speaker in terms of rule 208 :
mr speaker , i want to move an amendment regarding the south african government becoming involved , as follows :
mr speaker , i honestly believe that the last sentence of my motion accommodates just that .
( 2 ) expresses its regrets that this statement will damage south africa 's reputation internationally ; and
( 2 ) condemns all acts of intimidation that are taking place in our townships , especially in khayelitsha and nyanga ;
if there are no objections we can let the motion stand , have amendments to it and then vote on it .
and if we stumble or falter , we do our best to set things right as quickly as possible .
but i believe that we need to instil in all our people an even greater pride in their province .
other areas of cooperation in the fields of environmental education , communication , research and development will also be finalised then .
it is therefore essential that our natural assets must be well managed in this fine province of ours .
i have already shared some plans with the national minister of water affairs and forestry in this regard .
in the words of the 1998 triple inquiry report of the iba to parliament , and i quote :
i too , publicly and in the ncop , have called for the death penalty for murderers and rapists .
newspaper editor jon qwelane says the crystal ball does not show much promise for the african continent in the 21st century .
having said this , i want to emphasise that i too believe in president mbeki 's african renaissance .
i wish to repeat : the anc 's position is that we support the closing of ranks as in interim measure .
the determination of permits should be informed by economic viability and via local government public transport plans .
many of us have wondered who has actually been in charge of the transport portfolio over these last 51 days .
is it not part of the democratic process for one to have the right to object ?
mr speaker , the anc are kicking up a hullabaloo about what has happened over the past 51 days .
the hon minister should have had a direct amendment of the act and not of the regulations .
] we must not permit people to misuse a situation in order to commit criminal acts .
mr speaker , no wonder the resources are still distributed as we see them .
] the police cannot protect us and the national government has failed us .
if central and provincial government cannot stop criminals , then the new unicity should .
i look forward to and would encourage a criminal investigation department at municipal level , with their own municipal force .
it is obvious that we are moving towards a two-level government like great britain .
mr speaker , it is no wonder our youth feel safer amongst gangsters than sunday school teachers .
that is what has happened in manenberg where , in a question of 10 days six people were murdered .
we have to really apply our minds to the prisons , which have become control centres rather than solutions to the gang warfare problem .
this is a factor that we cannot induce but that we must have sensitivity and appreciation for .
mr speaker , i want to thank the hon member mr byneveldt for the debate he requested .
i have warned the hon minister in the office of the premier of the time-bomb that we are sitting on .
if i could , i would have quoted from the books of the quattro camps and from the poqo camps .
mr speaker , there is an even greater problem but i do not hear them talking about it .
there are more police personnel , vehicles and buildings in the advantaged areas and very few in the disadvantaged areas .
or is this type of attitude of his in line with what ms marike de klerk said about brown people ?
here i have in mind bredasdorp , vredendal , clanwilliam , hopefield and other towns which have become the target of such evils .
the national government has , as regards the total budget of the police in this country , which amounts to r14,5 billion ...
the fact that the western cape is getting only 180 of those 2 500 recruits is a point for discussion on its own .
the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism referred to the culture of gangsterism in the province .
i can give hon members the statistical breakdown of the percentage by which police stations are under strength at the moment .
since we last talked about the muizenberg police station , for instance , it has become 60 % under strength .
as community leaders those hon members have the ability to influence those people to take the course .
if hon members think that the course is not good enough , they should come and evaluate it for themselves .
the hon member mr n m isaacs referred to the role of the church and the teacher .
housing : p m jacobs , n c phenduka , a e van zyl , a r winde community safety : z c stali
c b herandien ( chairperson ) , n m isaacs , r j king , l ramatlakane , d silke , r williams
c b herandien ( chairperson ) , n m isaacs , r j king , l ramatlakane , d silke , r williams
this therefore compels us to bring this legislation to the standing committee and the house for approval .
mr speaker , i do , however , want to refer to the opening address yesterday of the hon premier .
mr speaker , the hon member is blowing so much hot air , i want to know whether the air-conditioning has been turned on .
i believe this is corruption - there is a very fine line between this and corruption .
then the minister of finance and the deputy president of the central government said that they were closing that tap .
the very next clause , which the hon members have purposely not read , states and i quote :
it was only when it came to the third weekend , in march 1999 , that they were paid .
unless examinations are written on friday evenings , saturdays or sundays , there could have been no disruption to the matric examination process .
it is no use those hon members coming here and trying to take it out on the coalition .
madam chairperson , we want those details now because we cannot simply authorise the expenditure .
i do want to see the hon member mr ramatlakane ; he has been trying to speak to me .
we have to respond to their answers in the way that they respond to the questions we ask .
madam chairperson , i have already explained that the ministry of housing , local government and planning is one ministry .
that is the best answer i can give hon members on that side of the house .
can the hon minister explain to us under which programme and subprogramme of his vote r707,82 came from ?
the hon premier does not sponsor this bill , the hon minister of finance and development planning does .
madam chairperson , obviously , there was one policy that ruled how the money was adhered to .
furthermore , is he satisfied that they actually carried out the tasks for which they were paid under this vote ?
if a man dies , what does the hon member expect me to do with the money i save ?
] no , i am trying to help the hon minister ; otherwise that hon member will have to act on it .
i was satisfied with that answer , so whatever vote it was taken away from , it has been reimbursed .
what i asked mr fourie was whether the department of education had lost any money to voter registration .
i said that the hon member mr ozinsky was wrong simply to assume that it was .
madam chairperson , on a point of order : the hon minister had a chance under his vote .
i am telling the hon member that out of the premier 's vote that is what i know .
madam chairperson , i am speaking as the minister of development planning and not as the minister of finance .
i have not accused the hon minister of being in contempt and therefore he should not sulk .
if not , that was a loss to health , but it was done for a good cause - voter registration .
could he have saved this r35 000 and given it to the subprogramme , waste management , in his department ?
as i was not part of the authorisation then of that expenditure , i cannot now ...
madam chairperson , secondly i would like to ask the hon minister of education the following .
let me also express to the hon premier our congratulations on the da election performance in the western cape .
yesterday he claimed victory for pagad members being in court and in jail .
we cannot be fair weather about these things ; we have to take the good with the bad .
the race card has been played time and time again , but it has been trumped by the delivery card ; the game has moved on .
" develop wide ownership , develop wide involvement " , those are appeals that the anc will continue to promote .
i want to make the point that the time for monitoring cameras on the borders of the townships is past .
i would like to congratulate the hon premier for the committed leadership that he displayed in his opening address .
mr speaker , a safe environment is one of the most important pillars on which prosperity and progress are built .
the three priorities that have been identified will further assist the hon minister of community safety in his challenging task .
my prayer is that the lord will bless him with exceptional wisdom to perform his important task .
the udm supports the hon premier 's initiative of a development policy and a job creation audit with regard to rural development .
why do they hide the fact that the matric exemptions in historically coloured and african schools are so shockingly low ?
these are people living in shacks and in the backyards of khayelitsha , manenberg , bonteheuwel , oostenberg and philippi .
there is no reason why the province does not have a rent tribunal to deal with these issues .
on the contrary , mr speaker , he and his anc cronies merely threaten people and this includes death threats and violence .
the hon premier and his government have never supported this noble initiative of our national government .
the da is a party that knows no history or experience other than engineering division .
mr speaker , there is a smattering of light at the end of this long and gloomy tunnel .
these poor people are streaming across our provincial boundary and putting tremendous pressure on our health workers and our ngos .
the hon premier comes here and says that we have some remarkable developments in our city .
his outstanding message shows once again why the hon premier has again received the award as best premier .
the loser was agriculture as a whole - the workers , the employers , the region and ultimately south africa as well .
the hon member mr dugmore raised a concern , and that is exactly what it is .
and , lastly , is the hon premier prepared to take responsibility for the harmful side-effects of these agents ?
the hon premier is knowingly ignoring the caution expressed recently by the scientific community in the usa .
furthermore , and perhaps more importantly , the fight against hiv / aids is linked to the fight against poverty .
we demand that hiv-positive people not be included in this process mainly for window-dressing , ...
on account of the corruption in the anc 's allocating sites and houses ; that is the trouble .
the sunday times of a few days ago reported on a councillor drawing two salaries a month .
i want to thank the hon premier for being a leader of all the people of the western cape .
to this date , the national government has taken no note of the drought in the southern cape , ...
this means that this government will pay out a one-off amount of r2 million to farm workers in the southern cape .
the hon member ms rossouw made a very brave effort here to try to defend the indefensible .
in return the counter trade spin-offs for south africa would result in the creation of 65 000 jobs amounting to r104 billion .
how many hiv-positive mothers could not have been treated after birth with this massive sum of r48 billion ?
we know that the pharmaceutical companies have been willing to cooperate with the anc government about cheaper aids drugs .
the presidential aids confusion has given the hiv-positive people new justification to throw condoms in the dirt bin .
it is time for the anc government to openly recognise and follow the pioneering example of the western cape province .
before coming to the more serious part of my speech , i must say something about the anc .
with the assistance of the unicity 's da administration , this programme will be fast-tracked in the next 18 months .
the function is now placed under the office of the premier , and the function has been rolled over again .
however , in many respects this appropriation carries a great deal of good news and it also carries some depressing news .
she probably still has sympathy and understanding for that because it is still in someone 's conceptual framework .
mr speaker , the progress is not the progress that people on the ground are expecting in this regard .
we all know that after that r400 had gone they still remained in exactly the same position they were in before .
the chairperson corrected it earlier on and the hon member heard him when he corrected it .
how was it decided that the southern cape should receive that money and not other regions of this province ?
the hon minister of community safety said that it was not the casino , but a consortium of businesses .
madam chairperson , i gladly regard it as a question in order to answer , if i may .
therein it is stated that the government is obliged to provide waterproof shelters where people are in distress .
i am sorry , but the question before the house is : when is the hon minister going to act ?
we must perform a service to the community and we shall certainly not flinch from that responsibility .
what is required , i would remind my hon colleague , is the fast-tracking of its implementation .
our view was that it was the responsibility of the hon minister to implement that act .
the death of taxi and bus drivers is a charge against the establishment of a democracy in our country .
mr speaker , people still have to walk long distances to the n2 to catch the buses .
i had to give my neighbours ' children a lift because they could not go to school .
the parties that want to take part in the elections should go and draft their election programmes and not life programmes .
i have taken hundreds upon hundreds of taxis off the street and there has been the enforcement of the rule of law .
to say that this is quiet diplomacy is the worst sort of opportunism one can come across .
they have not trained one new detective at the detective academy , but those from other provinces are trained .
i am currently training 161 police reservists at oudtshoorn , which is more than they have sent since 1995 .
many commuters have arrived late for work and , as has been pointed out , many students have arrived late for school .
mr speaker , the crisis at governmental level has been caused by the taxi industry not taking our government seriously .
mr speaker , i should like to thank all hon members who have participated in this very interesting debate .
it is , of course , not parliamentary , but i did not hear the hon minister say that .
the hon member ms essop clearly has provided no evidence of the accusation she has made here .
everyone who sits here exerting pressure on me to close the taxi ranks will be responsible for that .
it is a national criterion which the hon member mr ramatlakane agreed to , and that process is finished .
no member of the taxi industry sits on the lrtb because that would be a conflict of interest .
mr speaker , i also want to take the opportunity to thank the hon leader of the opposition .
" [ interjections . ] the commissioner informed me this morning , just before i came here , that we had obtained people .
] i do think that it is a good idea that we make more use of the standing committee .
an agreement was reached between convenco , sunwest and the three public shareholders , and signed on 3 december 1999 .
this shows one why telecommunication is so critical , as i have often pointed out to the house .
it is an accepted fact that the centre , as the hon minister has also pointed out , will be a tourist attraction .
there is no doubt that economic growth and foreign direct investment are important determinants of convention centre growth .
in this context the new convention centre , i think , should offer capetonians and the world a world-class experience .
future competition for tourism and commerce will come from the global village , not necessarily this continent or south africa .
mr speaker , i hope i still have time because i now want to come to the final point .
the hon member mr silke referred to the critical importance of this centre for capetonians , amongst others .
the non-voting shares are owned by sunwest , because the particular contribution which they had to make had to be tax business-friendly .
that is correct , madam chairperson , because , quite frankly , i think the first amendment is sufficient .
madam chairperson , i refer to clause 5 on p 3 , line 35 .
the unauthorised expenditure amounting to r33 531 178,12 arising from excess expenditure on the vote was considered .
that has been done in terms of the local government : municipal structures act , 1998 ( act 117 of 1998 ) .
this is provided for in sections 7 , 8 , 9 and 10 of the local government : municipal structures act .
the hon minister is the person who is supposed to be leading his party through the local government election .
the provincial constitution requires that provincial legislation must determine the different types of municipalities to be established in the western cape , ...
this suggests an intention , because it means that a person is constantly lying and that is certainly unparliamentary .
the udm believes that we should deal very carefully with the new and hard-won democracy in our country .
mr speaker , the bill lists the various types of municipalities that may be established in the province .
in many respects he was really an example , and he will be sadly missed in the legal world .
] i think that while i am on this side , i shall say they have no case .
it is against this background and in this context that the anc government seeks to transform the judiciary .
the south african courts are perceived as mere handmaidens of the executive , and reflect an official set of values .
we will not be lectured by people and parties who kept silent when the judiciary ...
the leaders and ministers of the anc are setting a poor example in terms of a system which they themselves designed .
i listened with interest to the contribution made by the hon member mr r williams .
however , they are making a serious contribution towards the judiciary at the moment by placing anc politicians into judicial positions .
we are saying that the judicial service commission act should be amended to provide for such a procedure .
( a ) notes the defection of three new np councillors in centurion on 15 february 2000 ;
] the hon minister in the office of the premier was not even on the political terrain .
i was chairperson of the bonteheuwel branch and the hon member mr marais the chairperson of the nooitgedacht branch .
] quite frankly , he is the man of high principles who wanted to join the dp .
now like desperate lovers , they are resorting to harassment and stalking , and this motion is part of it .
they would give the new np their banner and their name , and share their resources with them .
] the dp warned that we wanted all the power - the premiership and everything else .
] van zyl slabbert , van eck , helen suzman , mary burton , the end conscription campaign , the black sash ...
he started with the labour party , carried on and mentioned why he had come to the np .
in our hearings we met with a number of businesses , and i will give hon members a few examples .
the promotion of small , medium and micro businesses is a central element in the government 's job-creation strategy and income generation .
the perception among formal financial bodies is that investment in the smmb sector is non-profitable , non-cost-effective and a risk .
entities such as the small businesses development corporation will continue to play an integral part in the establishment of small businesses .
it will not only show the true colours of the dp , but also clearly unmask their hypocrisy .
however , despite all these positive developments , major challenges still faced black businesses and the smme sector .
in the eyes of the dp , both here and in the unholy opposition party nationally , these problems do not exist .
these small , medium and micro enterprises need to be nurtured and not constrained by restrictive government policy .
the principal problem that potential small business owners have in obtaining venture capital is the labyrinth of red tape and regulations .
we also spoke about differential treatment of bond defaulters , and employment practices in banks .
we must debate with the banks until they align themselves with the socio-economic objectives of our country .
my wife was one of those who wanted to have a business but could not get the money .
there is also the history that has denied them the ability to generate collateral and so on .
it is the first one in south africa , because they could not get it going anywhere else .
in the three core areas - finance , professional support and economic opportunities - this government will do its bit .
( ii ) portfolio committee amendments and rejected amendments to south african council for educators bill [ b26c-2000 ] .
the committee wishes to recommend that the unauthorised expenditure of r2 287 980,27 be authorised by the provincial parliament .
the unauthorised expenditure amounting to r3 850 140,72 arising from excess expenditure on the vote was considered .
( iii ) competition second amendment bill [ b41-2000 ] .
therefore calls upon the speaker to apply the standing rules to ensure that -
mr speaker , i would like to clearly state what the western cape eighth gambling and racing amendment bill involves .
the np brought about apartheid laws , but the dp enjoyed implementing the apartheid laws .
madam speaker , it is a great pleasure for me to enter the debate today .
the anc want a bigger , more powerful centralised state ; the da strives for a smaller , better federal government .
the middle class in south africa is so small that the tax burden on it tends to be disproportionate .
they are right to feel victimised into paying moneys that they simply cannot afford .
that is no different from existing legislation - to be specific , municipal ordinance no 20 of 1974 .
madam speaker , the hon member mr silke started off his speech by referring to the da .
all of us know that african nationalism and coloured nationalism have a much closer home than white liberalism is trying to achieve .
another important point to which reference has already been made is the phase and the phasing in of this piece of legislation .
rates in poor areas such as hanover park , manenberg , tafelsig , guguletu and langa declined by 1 % , however .
in the majority of municipalities i have encountered an excellent control policy but the problem lies in its implementation .
these points are only some of the many realities facing the farming sector in the western cape .
one of the obstacles to growth in the agricultural economy is international competition and domination of world markets .
it is visible when workers who for years had to suppress the urge for self-defence , abused those who mishandled them .
and yet - i say this with respect - the remarks by the hon minister are so much in conflict with his actions .
earlier this afternoon , during an interpellation , he said that we should find a definition for " inhuman brutality " .
i want to make my ruling now , before the speaker arrives , on the request for a minute 's silence .
that all the standing committees are listed as key oversight functionaries and not just the standing committee on public accounts .
( iii ) competition second amendment bill [ b41-2000 ] .
( 4 ) appeals to companies to launch a responsible advertising campaign highlighting the dangers of alcohol abuse .
mr speaker , my words were , " sometimes even a peanut gallery must shut up .
professional people with proven track records will run these casinos , which will be regulated by the board .
mr speaker , i now come to the issues raised by the hon member mr ozinsky .
his reply to me was , " thanks for the invitation to serve on the multi-party task team ...
it was only the tuesday after that that the hon member mr ozinsky tabled this motion .
] i will give the report to them because they were established for that purpose .
mr speaker , as i have always said , i am prepared to be transparent and accountable .
mr speaker , on a point of order : the hon premier is misleading the house .
mr speaker , surely there is the potential to expose oneself to the risk of conflict .
we call on the hon premier to act in the interests of good governance .
hon members should travel the world and see how many financially failed convention centres there are .
they are not even allowing any of their mpps the freedom to speak in this debate .
then we find that he did it privately , probably over a drink with the hon premier .
i dealt with the attendance , apologies , minutes and any matters arising from the minutes and the next item .
and then , immediately we had finished the matter , who stepped in but saleem mowzer , the director ?
( iii ) education laws amendment bill [ b48-2000 ] .
surely , if that place had been kept under surveillance , they would have seen somebody putting something in a tree .
in contrast to remarks of this kind , criticism and promises that we hear , the record of the anc is far clearer .
i want to quote to the house the words of leo buscaglia in only you can make the difference :
in cape town two pagad members were convicted of killing seven-year-old chrystal abrahams of ocean view .
the people and the resources are now in place to ensure progress with all the interrelated operations .
( 2 ) confirms that the symbolism against racism was evident during the tree planting ceremony on 21 march 2000 ;
they were then obliged to hire a kombi themselves in order to pay their last respects .
the hon minister of health reacted to that by saying that it was not his hospital .
racism is even more deadly than aids , because it destroys the human spirit and the soul .
the same could be said of their choice of deputy speaker , where they elected the hon member ms brown .
while the anc preaches the policy of racial headcounting , mr speaker , they do not , of course , practise it .
and this compassionate , caring south africa is what we on this side of the house are striving to create .
] and that is precisely why the anc is trying to introduce the race debate with such vigour .
] can one imagine if we sank to the same level , what we could have done ?
i believe scenes such as this would have been very unlikely under former president mandela 's statesmanlike leadership .
and if such incidents had occurred , they would have been roundly condemned from the very top ...
] within a single year president thabo mbeki has squandered president mandela 's legacy of non-racialism .
none of us here who come from african , coloured and indian communities can assume that .
if only the coloureds and africans were not so tense with each other we could sort it out .
it was tony leon who refused even to consider being part of his cabinet .
to begin with , mr speaker , i want to thank all the hon members who participated in the debate .
a jersey cow is yellow-brown with white , brown or black spots , but they form part of one body .
i had expected the hon member ms essop to attack the officials here , because that is her pet subject .
many of those officials were asked to go , and many of them took the voluntary severance package .
in that regard i shall concede the point that aids may have been caused by " aliens " .
( 2 ) further expresses its concern at the impact of such decisions on governance in the province .
in terms of the rules , the hon member mr jacobs makes his point very clear with the point of order .
if members of the dp call that racist , it means that they are telling us that we are racists .
the president of the anc and of the country , thabo mbeki , made that very clear in beaufort west .
mr speaker , i would like to know if the hon member is prepared to take a question .
supporting the establishment of privately controlled marketing organisations which operate in competition with each other and without state involvement ;
" the hon minister of education referred to black women in parliament as people looking for food to eat elsewhere .
the hon member mr dugmore asked me to suspend a person who does something wrong .
mr speaker , the hon member mr dugmore referred to a farmer from albertinia , mr cor laubser .
the hon member mr fransman spoke about a farmer who dragged a worker behind his van .
the matter that we discussed was initially placed on the order paper as a notice of a motion .
( vi ) south african boxing bill [ b58-2000 ] .
( b ) the provisions of the act were implemented incorrectly and / or inconsistently by various municipalities ;
( e ) the objectives of the act are not achieved or the achievement thereof is delayed .
a legal opinion on the matter must also be obtained by the national department of provincial affairs and local government .
( b ) all possible assistance be given with regard to staff and financial resources for the relevant audit ;
( g ) that there was no undue influence by officials during the allocation of contracts .
( iii ) competition second amendment bill [ b41d-2000 ] .
] he recognised the value of having an accountable and transparent process in the committee stage .
yesterday that fact relieved many - perhaps most - of the participants here of meeting their obligations .
i will say more about this in the main budget to be tabled on 28 february 2000 .
] that is not good enough , and i am glad the hon member has mentioned the tv cameras .
in fact , they have to be there from 04 : 00 in the morning in order to be able to see the doctor .
biblically , the figure 7 means that a season is complete and the figure 8 symbolises new beginnings .
many hon members from the anc have spoken about the haves and have-nots .
it is the words of a powerful man speaking on behalf of the powerless but saying nothing about it .
racism must be discussed and addressed in words and deeds which build unity , not election slogans which divide .
i have always said to the hon minister of community safety that their surveys and research are good .
the time has come for hon members on that side of the house to read it as well .
mr chairperson , i want to tell the chief whip of the da that my family were also farmers .
moreover , mr speaker , we believe people want to see things working and for things to be functional .
there are many popular art forms that quite often are not recognised or are recognised as inferior art forms .
if there are still racists on this side of the house , they must stand up and declare themselves .
] there must be criticism , but it must be constructive in order to benefit the people out there .
south africa is a sport-loving nation but unfortunately its participation rates in sport do not seem to bear testimony to this .
the effect was that so many children were interested during the holidays that we had to arranged another 11 meetings .
as a result , during that period there was an absolute reduction in violent crime in those areas .
mr speaker , let me begin by wishing the hon premier a happy belated 60th birthday .
the benni mccarthys and the quinton fortunes , to name just two world-class players , are now gracing the soccer pitches overseas .
there are five municipalities , and in three of them the anc received more votes than the da .
i must emphasise , however , that we should not and cannot ever regard ourselves as an island in south africa .
yes , we can all say that we were very busy last year , but minmec did not function well .
in plettenberg bay , however , they promptly told dr botha to pack his bags and go .
give us the r1,4 billion of unspent national housing funds and he will do the job , and do wonders .
the hon member mr n m isaacs referred to our policy objectives , the yardstick by which we measure ourselves .
the hon member mr louis also spoke about cooperation and the necessity of encouraging entrepreneurship .
i thank the hon members mr a j williams and ms rossouw for their contributions in this regard .
that may be a little extreme , but the hon member mr dugmore is obviously in a different province .
the hon minister of education can recommend a number of adult education classes where he may learn to count .
mr speaker , i will return to this objection by the dp at the end of my speech .
mr speaker , why does the hon minister regard the referral of the boy to harold cressy as ludicrous ?
the principal of herzlia was outraged at the suggestion that muslim children should not go to his school .
mr speaker , it is tragic that when racism is referred to , we still assume that ...
for the people of the cape , it is clear that the coalition is unholy and of little use .
we in the western cape are tremendously privileged to have a worthy man such as gerald morkel as premier .
their personal attacks on the hon premier have not contributed to better governance in the province .
he deserves a pat on the back for the colossal work that he is doing to establish a tourism policy for this province .
i want to emphasise that the hon premier said that this project was his government 's most important project this year .
for the benefit of the hon member mr isaacs , if the provincial government wants to deal with issues of voter registration , ...
the stress of adv heunis 's advice is that the iec should request such assistance .
mr speaker , i do not know what i have to withdraw , but i will happily do it .
before i respond to whatever that hon member said , i want to put some matters across .
it will have to be done in the prescribed way ; otherwise the hon member will have to approach the speaker .
if they are kapenaars , it means they do not want any other person but their kapenaars here .
do those hon members remember the kind of houses that they built for us , the african people , in this province ?
i am deeply sorry that the former minister of social services and poverty relief has been removed from his post .
one thing is abundantly clear - the anc in this province can walk with its head held high .
the mail & guardian was correct when it said that the hon premier is the most boring person .
it is a fact that the anc needs only four votes and the coalition government will be out !
are they saying that she should now come to talk to the hon premier again about how they treat her ?
mr speaker , can i ask the hon member mr mckenzie whether he reported this matter ?
it seems to me the hon member is saying that if there are one or two , then we should ignore them .
we must ask today why the objection regarding the registration comes from the anc every time .
they are scared that too many people will be registered , because how do we stand with the registration in the western cape ?
the problem is not that the job is being taken over , but that support and assistance are being given .
what a pity therefore that the anc keeps regurgitating and playing the racial card .
first of all , i would like to thank the hon premier for the vision he has for this province .
i told him , " put a lot of egg on your face and go as premier morkel .
i have to tell the hon minister of finance and development planning that we did not speak to him .
they said that funds had been transferred to a central revenue account when , in fact , they had not .
they have failed to deal with critical issues , or even to mention them .
i appeal to the likes of the hon member mr gelderblom and the hon minister of agriculture .
as the hon premier was reading his opening address , there were already , according to this report , ructions in the anc .
i want to congratulate the hon premier on his opening address and on the positive initiatives that he has mentioned .
now we have cata and codeta - two groups representing the same people - massacring each other .
why can we not work together here and now , where we are serving together as members of this parliament ?
those days are far behind us . the days when we labelled people according to race are long gone .
mr speaker , the hon premier dealt with the issue of racism here today from another angle .
mr speaker , for the anc it is good enough that these people are members of the anc .
in contrast , the sunday times stated that those hon members are never in their constituencies .
] i challenge that , because the hon minister does not even have a plan to deal with this .
they are picking up on the schools that have already tried their best to go out and collect funds for themselves .
after the clowns they brought on what they termed " a unique individual " called the boneless wonder .
] however , it was an open , fair and transparent process and the best person got the job .
at the end of last year we also trained 20 of them to be dedicated tourist police .
it took r460 000 to pay them for the first six months to be tourist police .
mr speaker , it is a particular privilege for me to participate in the debate today .
with dignity and respect , everybody shared in the opening of the national assembly on 4 february 2000 .
what i want to ask our anc friends , however , is to consult our community about arrangements of this kind .
mr speaker , we in south africa must learn to take one another into account , and then we will win .
there is no doubt that the incidence of hiv / aids is on the increase .
we must pay heed to the warnings that we need to act decisively and cut the gordian knot .
i want to raise a few points on which i feel i can give the hon members in the new np answers .
madam speaker , there exists in cape town a highly innovative company called freeplay that manufactures wind-up radios .
these radios do not use batteries , making them ideal for poorer communities in rural areas .
perhaps all goods manufactured in the province should say " made in the western cape " .
i am concerned lest our own president mbeki , while playing santa claus in zimbabwe , forgets our own people .
' ' the powers that they have are enough , he says , and they do not need extra powers .
the hon member mr marais was given the responsibility of speaking about poverty and dealing with poverty alleviation .
madam speaker , in the first place i would like to thank you for protecting me before the heckling starts .
i would remind those hon members that 42 % in this province voted for them .
madam speaker , on a point of order : the hon member mr ozinsky is continuously giving a commentary .
as i have done before , i am going to have to rule the hon member mr ozinsky out of order again .
mr speaker , before i commence , may i welcome here in our presence the schoolchildren from windermere school .
let me add , sir , that education alone accounts for some 57 % of this , and health 33 % .
the adult literacy rate in the province is estimated to be 95 % , in comparison with the national average of 75 % .
( b ) key measurable objectives ( kmos ) have been introduced for all the main departmental programmes .
the batho pele ( people first ) principle and its effective monitoring must be put in place .
it should also be noted that r5 million was allocated to this vote in the recent 1999-2000 adjustments estimates .
health , rehabilitation of hospitals , amounts to r2 800 million ; housing , r103,212 million ; and for housing , human settlement development programme , r9 million .
according to the revised 1996 census , 68,3 % of households in the western cape earn less than r3 500 per month .
an essential prerequisite for this is a regional environment which is conducive to investment and which provides safety and security .
bills and portfolio committee amendments received from national parliament and tabled by the speaker in terms of rule 208 :
bill and portfolio committee amendments received from national parliament and tabled by the speaker in terms of rule 208 :
i quote the two paragraphs under the heading , " vote 8 : planning , local government and housing " :
the hon minister has no understanding of the procedures of the committee or respect for the standing rules .
the anc government has misused the power granted by the act to give fishing rights to friends .
although there is heavy pressure to sell provincial properties , the province must be very careful about this .
mr speaker , there is a tendency in the house to make the standing committees simply rubber stamps .
section 228 ( 1 ) provides that a provincial legislature may impose extra taxes and levies .
may not be exercised in a way that materially and unreasonably prejudices national economic policies ...
this must not be seen as an extra tax , because the acdp is against extra tax .
the acdp and i would not be putting our name to a process that we had not worked through .
mr speaker , with reference to the strategic policy directives and economic growth , we must also congratulate the hon premier .
the report states that if the plan is not in place , the money will be used elsewhere .
mr speaker , that is a major advance from the old propaganda to the new understanding of fiscal discipline .
the new public finance management system will refine this process even further when it comes into operation in april .
mr speaker , first of all , i want to talk about my attitude to my job in so far as the budget is concerned .
what he continued with was the old refrain of " let us blame apartheid " .
i do not wish to be accused again by that side of the house of being incompetent .
i am not suggesting that i am going to try to climb out of it in any way .
unfortunately i cannot agree with the hon member mr louis that it is not a tax .
he did not stand up on his hind legs and say that he accepts the scof report with one exception .
at the heart of the strategic objectives are the nine policy goals identified by the coalition cabinet in june 1999 .
the forensic audit team has achieved considerable success over the past year in combating fraud and corruption .
however , as custodian of this province i do feel that the western cape is being short-changed again .
this is a lot of money when we take into account what we contribute towards the national fiscus .
we have demonstrated that we are able to manage our fiscus , and the international investment community has rewarded us appropriately .
hon members should bear in mind that the 1999-2000 financial year must be seen as a crawling stage for the desks .
as far as our desk-specific programmes are concerned , the desks will implement individual programmes in order to achieve their specific objectives .
this management framework affords greater manoeuvrability to ministers and their heads of department to manage their departments within broader guidelines .
the past ten years has seen a shift in focus away from misconduct inquiries towards legislative drafting and litigation .
in this regard the unit has managed a substantial increase in written opinions , contracts , litigation matters and pieces of legislation .
they need to be considered when new buildings and sports grounds , like the velodrome in goodwood , are built .
however , the breakdown in law and order is so endemic that it is tough to catch up .
i am therefore pleased to support the prudent and fiscally efficient budget of this department .
i therefore recommend that the establishment of the youth commission should be based not only on legal grounds .
we accept the explanation of the hon minister of finance and development planning regarding the r10 million for welfare .
this government should place more particular emphasis on abstinence and behavioural change , rather than on expending funds on condoms .
i still feel very strongly that this budget is not going to be spent according to the needs of the community .
we need to be consistent and say that we need to evaluate and look at the issues that are going to empower women .
the intergovernmental approach is going to help us see whether , in tourism for example , there is anything happening around gender .
mr chairperson , we in the western cape have to strive for a vision of reconciliation , prosperity , peace and security .
we are required to be innovative in our approach and vigorously seek partnerships to seal the process of empowerment .
mr chairperson , my people are part of the political mainstream but have been left on the economic sidewalk .
mr chairperson , it is all very well to shift the blame , but we must take responsibility .
] the second is that he says the problem with austria is that it is overrun by foreigners .
no doubt , we can allow interjections , but at the moment it is just a duel between the two sides .
a few hours later there was a press statement by justin de a ' lende of the anc youth league .
we are very busy with that and in the course of the year we shall devote very serious attention to it .
i am saying that i do not mind that , but i would like us to be constructive .
i said that the transformation process in our province had been revisited and a priority focus had been placed on further reform initiatives .
let me tell the hon member that we have six , and one of them is in africa .
bills and portfolio committee amendments received from national parliament and tabled by the speaker in terms of rule 208 :
on page 2 , in line 3 , to omit " substitution " and to substitute " amendment " .
that represents an increase of r7,651 million , compared with the adjusted amount of the previous year 's budget .
an isolated provincial parliamentary building , something i have observed in some other provinces , can also be counter-productive .
i therefore give my full support to this budget vote and will support further funding that may become available .
the budget will be tested at the end of the current financial year when the house sits in 2001 .
if hon members read page 15 they will see that the research team said , and i quote :
in that way , smaller parties will also be able to play a meaningful and functional role in this parliament and its activities .
one immediately thinks of scopa , which until recently had an independent-minded chairperson , who was removed .
when it comes to the detail of each department , however , it is the portfolio committee that should deal with that .
the meeting was in order to familiarise myself with the proposed thesen island development .
mr speaker , firstly if it was a fact-finding mission , why was only one side listened to ?
it was a fact-finding mission and i did the developer the courtesy of speaking to him .
in the same statement he said that the western cape government is going to be involved with the registration of voters .
regarding the involvement of the cmc , i can tell the hon member that the matter was disposed of long ago .
( iii ) we have digested this report within the department and are now working on a draft green paper .
by the way , cape town is the only municipality that did not give its cooperation in relation to the land audit .
new establishments for 2000 were made available to institutions in november 1999 , based on enrolment during 1999 .
mr speaker , the tender board was set up in april 1996 , but the 1996-97 annual report is still outstanding .
draft legislation relating to control of the dumping of medical waste has been drawn up in consultation with organised local government .
( 2 ) what has been the long delay in the department acting in this regard ;
the department made specific recommendations regarding the review of the emp and its implementation .
( 2 ) what does the draft coastal zone policy for the western cape province proposed as an appropriate use of grotto bay beach ?
land shall be deemed zoned in accordance with the utilisation thereof , as determined by the council concerned ...
mr speaker , my request is that you make a ruling so that discipline can be restored in the house .
i am actually saddened that cosatu did not use the opportunity to even nominate any black people .
( 2 ) all bona fide cultural organisations may apply for subsidies for activities in the prescribed format .
the project facilitated 160 empowerment projects during the financial year for women from previously disadvantaged communities in the western cape .
they were also responsible for lingerie-making and the likes , which was quite curious for cultural services .
at a project in wynberg there were 405 people ; in worcester , 184 people ; in stellenbosch , 4 000 people .
i see the hon member ms essop is also prepared not to ask another question .
( 2 ) when will the report be submitted to the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling ;
mr speaker , i see that the hon member who asked the question is not here .
( 3 ) no formal litigation process between the provincial government and the " successful consortium " has been initiated .
mr speaker , on a point of order : we are a little embarrassed on this side .
mr speaker , on a point of order : you addressed us about the questions for written reply .
mr speaker , as i told the hon member , it was wonderful to be there .
the minister . with respect , mr speaker , i have a point of order : i have just been called a racist .
the community police officers scheme is contributing about 14 % to 15 % of the functional officers corps of the saps at the moment .
( 2 ) whether he intends taking any steps regarding this matter ; if so , what steps ?
mr speaker , i get the impression from the question that i am being asked for a personal opinion .
this confidential clearance of security guards includes the fact that they have never been convicted of any criminal offence .
this policy is strongly supported by the national cabinet and a further 600 security guards are presently being trained .
] he has increased the local road transportation board from 6 to 9 members and he will increase it to 12 .
one of our nine policy objectives is that the western cape is the gateway to south africa , and also to the african continent .
as far as the issue of tonka bosman school is concerned , the hon minister is addressing it with us .
in conclusion , mr speaker , i think that the community also has a responsibility to people in our community .
we cannot do some window-dressing exercise that does not address transformation in the province .
die bestaande adjunk-direkteur-generaal pos ( huidige pos van kallie saayman ) sal omskep word na ' n superintendent-generaal pos .
regsdienste se pos word opgegradeer tot ' n adjunk-direkteur-generaal pos en die huidige direkteur : opleiding se pos word opgegradeer .
mr speaker , it is very clear that the hon member ms essop has a predetermined agenda .
] the fact of the matter is that it simply confirms again that things here leak like a sieve .
may i add , it is probably a national record - only 17 days after the person was arrested .
the problem is that every time the campaign is delayed , it mutates into another form and moratoriums are announced .
there have been various problems with it and they are being handled by the hon minister of transport , sport and recreation .
the national minister of transport made certain statements and said , among other things , " we are going to clamp down on this .
the reports for the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 financial years are being prepared and will be submitted towards the end of september 2000 .
mr speaker , i would also like to ask the hon minister of local government and development planning a follow-up question .
i do not think that we should occupy ourselves with such petty issues and fight about these things .
mr speaker , i do not mind what i am called in this house , minister or mec .
the chair has tried to save time by limiting hon members to three supplementary questions , and the time has now expired .
during my tenure as responsible minister no grievances regarding discrimination have been lodged using this mechanism .
various other accusations regarding discrimination have been made over the past five years through channels other than the two official channels described above .
mr speaker , i have prepared a very detailed response to the question totalling about seven pages .
the hon member mr jacobs is prepared to accept the submission of the hon minister of health .
but this is part of the reality we live with when even basic health needs compete with falling health budgets .
i was called to deliver such a speech within 100 days of taking up office .
a work study report to implement a fully-fledged directorate for hiv / aids within the department has been completed .
mr speaker , could the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism indicate what the weighting of the community reinvestment criteria are ?
he should put the question on the order paper and name the places and i will provide him with the answer .
mr speaker , i told the hon member mr ramatlakane that it came to my attention .
the department of transport is only an agent for the payment in accordance with the audited statements they receive .
as i have said , it came to my attention after i had sent that letter to him .
the national constitution determines that our country values the supremacy of the constitution and the rule of law .
in 1997 the cabinet was presented with a proposal that the implementation of the ten point plan would be looked into .
a policy cannot simply be reduced to a formula , something which the regulations will address .
the hon minister is waiting for regulations that are not substantially necessary , before any process of policy development takes place .
i might tell the hon member i am thoroughly exhausted waiting for central government .
how is it possible for him suddenly to have a loophole in the constitution as an excuse today ?
that national legislation - i repeat - must prescribe a framework in which preferential procurement policy may be implemented .
if the administration and the department of sport and recreation can provide any assistance then we shall do so .
mr speaker , the relationship between an employer and an employee is regulated by the labour relations act .
i want to ask the hon minister of local government and development planning whether that is the real reason .
the western cape disability desk is currently considering the funding of a project proposal which was submitted to them during august 2000 .
a structure was put in place for a website in liaison with the office of the premier and other desks .
accordingly the post was filled by the person who had retired as town clerk and has been appointed on a contract basis .
so that policy has fundamentally undermined the hiv / aids strategy in our schools ; there is no question about it .
i , in turn , contacted archbishop ndugane to act as mediator between these two bodies .
the campaign cost the province approximately r35 per head , but it was money well spent .
" working there " and " involved there " are two different things .
once i have found out what he is doing there i will come back to the hon member with the information .
in particular , there is now an opportunity to integrate our approach to the promotion of tourism .
in addition to these initiatives we have also decided to establish a western cape interest office within the european union .
the western cape and quebec are the only regions outside europe to have been granted membership of this important association .
i thank the hon minister of health and his department for all the work they have done .
with this objective in mind , we have appointed a task team to draw up a comprehensive rural development policy .
in fact , 23 % of all the jobs created in the country last year were in the western cape .
mr speaker , we had the good fortune not to have the other sheep with us too .
] secondly , i would like to wish everybody else a prosperous and good new year .
we are not only talking about the amounts of roll-over funds , but the duration of roll-over funds .
mr speaker , we support the western cape second adjustments appropriation bill with the very serious reservations that i have expressed .
r36,3 million to transport for road construction , in an effort to address serious backlogs in general road maintenance ;
this coalition government will continue to deliver relief in terms of our policy objectives and whatever else of value our poverty relief consultants recommend .
mr speaker , it is my pleasure to respond to the two questions put by the hon member mr winde .
the authority involved in the delivery and treatment of sewage in the macassar area is the cape metropolitan council .
one pump had to be serviced and the back-up pump simply gave in when it had to do that work .
as i explained to him , this is a process that has been gone through because there was litigation .
( 2 ) municipalities themselves decide , within the framework , and they advertise to the community for objections .
to get back to the question by the hon member mr ramatlakane , the answer is as follows :
the market is a place where there is supply and demand , and supply and demand determine the rate .
the market is obviously going to fluctuate , but there has to be a standard formula-driven approach to it of some kind .
they will consult with public and private role-players and a specific opportunity for public input will be given .
( 3 ) the whole grotto bay beach house issue has become the subject of extensive investigations by several provincial and national departments .
mr speaker , to answer the first part of the question , i think it is shocking .
i have dealt with this matter in my main budget and i will not repeat my proposals here .
furthermore , the electronic purchasing system for all purchases up to the amount of r20 000 was rolled out to all departments .
the balance is to be recovered either by deductions from future payments or by means of normal follow-up or legal processes .
generally , outstanding debt is pursued by routine follow-up procedures , including legal process where necessary .
should the pilot project which i have referred to prove successful , it will be extended to other categories of debtors .
tax , in case the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation does not know it , is a national competency .
] accepting the budget while , at the same time , drawing attention to the serious shortcomings is cooperative governance .
on p 8 of the gold book the hon minister of finance and development planning refers to a new procurement policy .
some of the hon ministers do not know what policies are and have never tabled them .
i wish to reiterate to the hon minister that we should not give up this fight for own revenue generation .
and equipment to the value of r36 million in 1999 , which is r71 million in two years .
we were informed that the procurement policy was on the table with the standing committee for a year , without progress .
no , they also write tests , and a 70 % pass mark is required for the successful completion of the course .
madam chairperson , in the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling these issues were discussed over and over again .
some people might consider it ironical that this letter was signed by peter swart and hassan adams .
in so far as section 228 is concerned , i am totally against central government sweeping section 228 under the carpet .
perhaps that hon member should ask the hon member sitting next to him , the hon leader of the opposition .
the report also said that job creation and overall employment would be affected by the rate of economic growth and labour legislation .
at the time of the political transition in 1994 , harry oppenheimer is on record as having said , and i quote :
the question is whether there is a war plan and an instruction has gone out to make it work ?
this in effect means that technically they can answer only 50 % of the calls they receive .
i should like to pay tribute to deputy commissioner dirk crafford who is to retire shortly after a long and dedicated career .
comm max has now extended this mode of operation , as attested by the recent extremely successful operation maximum .
other operations were the awareness programmes in terms of advertising on big screens in shopping malls ; and radio talks with panels of experts .
i would like to refer here to our alcohol abuse summit that was so well attended by people from throughout the country .
madam chairperson , the feedback and progress relating to such projects is provided , and is then coordinated by the mechanism .
i also want to inform him , however , of how scof felt about community safety , and that scof fully supports him .
i am of the opinion , however , that the hon minister is definitely on top of everything he has to do .
the people of the western cape are sitting in " judgement " on the hon minister today and they are saying , " guilty .
on behalf of the anc i want to thank mr joshua and his team and wish them everything of the best .
in the cape flats and in our townships in particular our people simply cannot afford equipment and uniforms .
i have no problem with the rural areas , but we know what the crime situation is in the metropole .
we thank the department for their ongoing efforts and are pleased to support this vote .
the status quo is that with 10 000 officers the saps in the western cape is 40 % understaffed .
i would like to second the recommendation of the hon member mr byneveldt that project chrysalis should be better marketed .
into a preventative giant and develop young adults to be assets to society and provide ...
that hon member should not talk such nonsense if he does not know what the situation is .
that states that 76 % of those people do not trust that hon member and the provincial government .
of the 300 community policy officers we have trained , 50 % are black , 46 % are coloured and 4 % are white .
i do not sit on the board of the cpos , mr douw steyn represents the department on the board .
the hon member mr a j williams certainly spoke like a former teacher who cared a great deal for his pupils .
to end this debate , it is a great pity that the anc has taken the same approach as before .
i just want to make another plea , addressed in particular to the hon members on the other side of the house .
an amount of r450 000 was given for the support of major sporting events in the province for the above .
i would therefore like the hon minister to take note of what i have just said .
we in the western cape pride ourselves on the talent and achievements of our young up-and-coming ballroom and latin american dancers .
perhaps the hon minister should seriously consider hosting a major dance championship here in cape town .
through public-private partnerships , we in this province need to make sure that our youth is given every opportunity to excel .
madam chairperson , i want to join my colleague in congratulating the department of sport and recreation .
we budgeted r10 000 in the recreational programme for youth camps , and aids awareness is part and parcel of those camps .
the least we can all do is to walk on the mountain on a regular basis .
i believe it is appropriate that i make mention of the symbolism of the mini opening ceremony of the western cape parliament .
we already have our sporting heroes , but we also need to be prouder of the many other achievements of our province .
in this way the western cape will develop more effective and sustained public participation initiatives in the provincial parliament and departmental projects .
he is 83 years old , and it is so wonderful that he is able to be with us here today .
there are people like a magistrate at laingsburg who is available 24 hours every day and hears cases .
the national minister of transport must be assisted with his plan to license only larger , standard minibus taxi ' s .
mr speaker , such a step is the first down the slippery slope of the demise of democracy .
this flies in the face of , " letting the people govern " , and makes a mockery of local democracy .
i think they gave up their lives for their communities , not some power hungry individual .
good teachers go the extra 10 miles if necessary , and there are thousands of such teachers in the western cape .
we in the wced have therefore identified six critical success factors that we have to get right in order to deliver quality education .
i will return to the enormity of this task and some of my concerns later .
mr chairperson , as far as life orientation is concerned , we are seeking to re-establish it as a central component of the curriculum .
we are particularly focusing on preparing our technical colleges to be declared fet institutions early next year .
this makes the western cape schools the best connected schools in south africa , but it falls far short of the ideal .
] that is being done in the interest of good cooperation and out of appreciation for the hard work they are doing .
firstly , special attention will be devoted in ordinary public schools to preventing the development of unacceptable behaviour .
the argument here is that change by its nature is complex and non-linear and is chaotic and controversial .
recently the hon minister discovered the problem of falsified reports , and , quite rightly , she wants to eradicate the problem .
however , let me tell hon members what happened in the department once the camera flashes had died down .
apartheid denied black south africans decent schooling in the state education system and closed down church-run private schools which had provided an alternative .
i must say that i do not , from the acdp 's point of view , agree with her statement regarding corporal punishment .
in the disadvantaged communities in particular the teachers are the most important role model and therefore the onus rests more heavily on them .
madam chairperson , the local authorities will simply have to develop a different attitude to the needs of the schools .
in the light of the fact that we are holding the general management body election in august , how justified is such a decision ?
manenberg senior secondary school has 996 pupils and 28 teachers , with an average of 37 pupils per class .
there is also a gender imbalance at management level and a lack of resources to implement obe properly .
we are not trying linear mechanical change , but one has to lead and give direction .
however , i think that history will teach us which province has tackled the transformation process in education the best .
regarding the contribution by the hon member mr louis , we do have a very long way to go .
it may say something about me if i say that i cannot quite remember the filthy language .
i think that the curriculum and setwork books are areas in which we need to reflect the full diversity of literature .
i do not wish to create expectations , as apparently happened at the khanyolwethu secondary school , but i shall certainly do so .
the so-called community health service organisation ( chso ) has been identified as a field that we must manage better in future .
the district health system will itself contribute towards significant management efficiency as a result of a reduction in fragmentation and duplication of services .
- we will be focusing on the efficient running of non-clinical services , including the better utilisation of laundry services .
the benefits of these day surgery wards now include greater convenience for the patients and less expense for the hospitals .
it is incredible to see how much income can be generated for the hospital if it is done successfully .
funds have also been set aside in the budget for the construction of community health centres in kraaifontein , delft , vanguard and green point .
another dimension of a health care service that cares more , is the provision of sufficient trained nurses to provide nursing care .
hiv / aids is our national disaster , and it should be number one on the government 's priority list .
according to you , it should be near or in the province where the most patients are concentrated , for example kwazulu-natal .
one of the world 's top malaria research institutes is in antwerp , belgium , namely the institute for tropical diseases .
this year alone it is believed that more people will die of tb than any other year worldwide .
a chronic shortage of funds to rural areas has led to greater discrepancies in the health status of rural people .
madam chairperson , an investment in the health of children is an investment in the future of the nation .
i want to congratulate the department of health and social services on taking a more businesslike approach .
needless to say we knew that the hon minister was going to speak about aids today .
apparently dr sutcliffe was there on new year 's day , so i do not know how he celebrated old year 's eve .
perhaps the hon minister could also indicate whether he has been there between midnight and two o ' clock in the morning .
the reality , however , is that the secondary hospitals and primary care clinics have far more rigid controls than hospitals such as tygerberg .
revenue targets are needed , and they are probably needed as part of the budget of the department of health as well .
madam chairperson , i want to start off by relating a true story , the story of abraham fortune of elsies river .
on wednesday a doctor saw him and said that he had to be rushed to tygerberg hospital immediately .
we should introduce incentive schemes to lure retired nurses back to the profession to help with voluntary home care .
private hospitals have become a booming industry , because we allowed state hospitals to fall into a state of disrepair .
madam chairperson , i think that it is very clear who should be the premier in this house .
he came here today , obfuscated the issue of equipment , and said that about r50 million would be spent .
we are speaking about medical equipment and , if one goes through the budget , that comes down to about r33 million .
he has probably gone to all the professors and told them that the academic hospitals are receiving r80 million extra .
if hon members ask me , i say it is an overexpenditure on the increase of r80 million .
i deal with all hon members on that side of the house in a very courteous manner , and they with me .
from the day i talked about private paying patients we introduced a trading account at karl bremer hospital .
i want to thank the hon member mr jacobs for his kind words regarding dr sutcliffe and the staff .
health - as he knows better than i do , because he was my predecessor - is a very emotional matter .
moreover , their restructuring is essential for an improvement in the delivery of services , with an ethos of customer service .
madam chairperson , i would like to refer to the social welfare financing policy and the shift in policy issues for social welfare .
it consists of 13 different financing formulae , characterised by , amongst others , little scope for innovation .
it places strong emphasis on outcomes and the monitoring of performance , something which has been seriously lacking to date .
at this point the arrest rate of juveniles in the western cape is 1 400 per month .
they have moved their offices to the facility and rape crisis has also opened a branch at the centre .
at the former , some of the women are already generating an income of between r700 and r800 per month .
this convention is based on four principles , namely the best interests of the child , survival and development , non-discrimination and participation .
they will be operational from 1 april 2000 and will start in khayelitsha , athlone and bellville .
i think we all need that support if there are one or two hiccups in the system .
the phasing out of the state maintenance grant over a period of three years commenced on 1 april 1998 .
i just want to refer to our customer service and one of the benchmarks that we have set in respect thereof .
i also congratulate the hon acting minister of social services on his maiden budget speech and wish him well .
the stigmatisation and discrimination which have become synonymous with the disease often have their roots in fear and ignorance .
ngos rendering services to people infected and affected by the disease are also subsidised .
it was a national programme which culminated in cape town , where it was addressed by president mandela .
this issue has been badly politicised , and the western cape government should try to deal with it in a different way .
we all know that r100 is very small amount , but r100 for a child is only one allocation .
unlike the fairy tale , madam chairperson , this cinderella has not been able to find the glass slipper .
to me , a good performance measurement would be her own stated objectives over the past two years in this house .
the hon premier has handed over r10 million on a plate to a non-delivering hon minister to deal with poverty relief .
what we need now is the use of that money in departments which are already engaged in poverty relief programmes .
the focus in our people 's development is to make them self-sufficient rather than beggars in a soup kitchen .
we need input from all hon members with regard to the multipurpose centres and the role they play .
in addition , 10 public sector hostels are being converted into family and single units under the hostel upgrading programme .
it is envisaged that a total of 11 438 family units and 1 871 single units will be provided under this programme .
the western cape education department has confirmed that construction of the first school in wesbank will commence within the next financial year .
hon members are aware of the fact that i appointed the first western cape housing development board on 1 january 2000 .
this model will enable us fairly to prioritise needs and projects on this basis .
the prioritisation model will also ensure the prudent and expedient spending of the annual budget allocation for the western cape .
the numerous land invasions , especially in the cape metropolitan area , called for the consideration and application of a rapid response strategy .
as already mentioned , there will be no money to initiate any new projects until the year 2003 .
if the hon member mr dugmore kept quiet , i would not need to interrupt him .
unfortunately , whilst this mechanism brings great relief in respect of service charges , it does not make provision for rates charges .
all we will succeed in is shifting the poverty and destitution around in an endless circle .
how , then , is it possible for my department and me to be accused of laxity and slow progress ?
i am happy to hear that the transfer of properties to local authorities has received a lot of attention .
i hope that the hon minister will give district six a better package with a little more incentive in it .
this hon minister knows that there are people living in parow park who own houses in other areas .
] the report also says very clearly that the people in parliament towers did not cooperate with the inquiry .
yesterday mr africa , in a very candid way , informed the committee that the forum had come to a standstill .
we are now hearing excuses about the manager of the housing fund , but the fund has not even been established yet .
i further wish to commend the hon minister on the move of his ministry and department to their new office space .
mr chairperson , another area of concern is the lack of commitment , or perhaps capacity , from local government .
with the backlogs i have mentioned , we cannot tolerate a lackadaisical attitude by the local government authorities .
violence is escalating in areas such as delft and du noon because there is no clear integration system and plan .
] tenants who had already spent thousands of rands on improvements were also denied the right to acquire home ownership .
] it is a disgrace that people still have to live in such conditions today , after six years of democracy !
people from all groupings are involved in urbanisation in the quest for a better life and for hope .
the whole idea behind the recommendation going to the provincial housing development board is to get as many people as possible back .
i want to tell hon members that at this stage only 39 posts are filled , while there are 56 vacancies .
a conditional grant of r5 million was made available to municipalities in the form of financial support or assistance .
let me go on to the next point and refer to the provision of a network of effective local government infrastructure .
there are , however , also positive aspects in prospect , specifically the envisaged legislation on disaster management .
the commission was established on 25 november 1999 and is just a little jump ahead of the non-metropolitan area .
i want to refer to a few of the challenges that i will put to the unicity commission and the district transformation forums .
i want to thank the members of minmec , and in particular the national minister for provincial and local government .
] i am saying that tongue-in-cheek , because i actually would not want to refer to myself in such terms .
yes , there are certain aspects that the hon minister mentioned that have not yet really been properly established .
i was under the impression that our valuation system was now in order and could be used at any time .
we are on our way to the election on 1 november , and the act has not yet been put in place .
oh dear , that hon member should rather not open his mouth , because , when he does , everyone can see how stupid he is .
the poor 100-day programme of the hon premier was nothing more than a gimmick , and he knows that .
since 1997 the cape metropolitan council , which is controlled by the new np , has never supplied any financial statements .
i want to know from him what the 13 members of the oostenberg executive went to do in botswana .
is it a matter of spending the money now because they know they will not be re-elected ?
madam chairperson , the key policy objectives of this department all have bearing on the final stages of municipal restructuring .
likewise , we will press for the devolution of powers and delegation of functions to municipal councils outside the metropoles .
madam chairperson , the anc naively assumes that mega-government will positively impact upon economies of scale .
the total amount which was given for municipal infrastructure increased from r666 million to r1,8 billion in 1997-98 .
yet , the r2,9 billion budgeted for housing in the 1999-2000 financial year was not reflected on provincial budgets .
i would like to add to what my bench-mate said regarding our disappointment at our exclusion from the unicity commission .
it is not the case , as the hon member mr isaacs says , that they are at one about the matter .
those problems in paarl can be solved if the anc and the new np work together in that area .
the dilemma is that we have to go the way of the 1993 legislation , which we do not want to do .
i must tell the hon member that the national department of finance had certain concerns in that regard .
i think that that in itself will be the subject of a very interesting and stimulating debate in the next week or two .
the submission of the financial statements was done with the approval of the auditor-general , but of course he had to reflect upon them .
in this regard , i again do not want to point fingers , because it is very easy to do that .
let us admit it honestly to one another here : hon members know that there were other views about the unicity , or megacity .
remuneration of public office bearers amendment bill [ b 11b-2000 ] .
remuneration of public office bearers amendment bill [ b 11d-2000 ] .
] i would like to request the hon member to repeat it and then we will take a decision .
( 3 ) once again , commits itself to the development of a non-racial , non-sexist , free and democratic western cape .
( 3 ) once again , commits itself to the development of a non-racial , non-sexist , free and democratic western cape .
madam speaker , there are seven principal challenges confronting the chief directorate : development planning in the new financial year .
good progress has been made in this regard , and the spatial plans for almost all the coastal areas are under way .
many applications are being received in the western cape for resort developments within the 1 015 km long coastal zone .
these concerns and responsibilities gave rise to the commissioning of the coastal zone policy for the western cape province .
provincial planning follows a strategic planning process in terms of which departments maintain their exclusive powers over their own generic planning and execution .
all vacant posts , which amount to 40 % of the establishment , will be advertised during the course of this month .
this department became a monstrosity and its tentacles wormed their way into every sphere of our lives .
can we afford a department that basically has r4 million to execute its functions for a financial year ?
i want to refer to section 10g ( 1 ) of the local government transition act , which is of particular relevance .
i am glad that the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism has graced us with his presence today .
this is in keeping with his key measurable objective number one , the reprioritisation of goals towards greater environmental sensitivity .
kogelberg biosphere , being the first of its kind in the country , is a step in the right direction .
the audi alteram partem rule means that as soon as one sees one person , one has to see a great many role-players .
i thank the hon minister , though , for his expressed commitment to dealing with the problem .
the situation that exists in this department is unacceptable , and the hon minister appears to agree with me .
" black " here is used as a generic term ; they have not broken it down into any more detail .
it is a forum where local government , civil society and the provincial government come together to discuss key planning issues .
secondly , i want to raise the issue of the danger that exists with the untested constitutionality of that act .
madam chairperson , i thank you for your recent ruling that interjections should be one , two or three words .
the nominations come from the different disciplines such as architecture , land surveying , et al. we have approximately two weeks to go .
a core function of environmental affairs is the work of the environmental management unit , which is responsible for implementing the environmental impact assessment regulations .
madam chairperson , i should like to thank dr kane-berman for the unselfish service she has rendered ...
this is proof that the western cape really cares about the needs of its people in the rural areas .
one of the aspects to which we as members of the president 's council gave attention was the issue of environmental training .
if we mess up the environment now through unstrategic development and processes , we will not be able to undo it .
i have spoken to that member and to other anc councillors in the south peninsula municipality and we discussed the issue .
mr chairperson , a people or a community without a cultural basis is a lost people or a lost community .
in this regard , i want to compliment the hon minister on the new and exciting initiative regarding the cape coons .
between milnerton and muizenberg there are more threatened plant species per square metre than in any other place in the world .
furthermore , south africa is one of the 17 countries world-wide in which two-thirds of the biological resources of the world occur .
although the subterranean water resource is very strong , it cannot be used at all because the water is too polluted .
] although the building of libraries is funded by the province , they are actually managed by the local municipalities .
somehow , the hon member mr louis always comes up with difficult questions for me .
he is going to be allocating to us some money from his poverty relief fund which was not spent ...
( 1 ) notes the racism , whether specific or by implication , which still prevails in the western cape ;
mr speaker , i wonder whether it is right that they want to hand it out but they can never take it .
] i can tell hon members why the matter dragged on for so long while he was the responsible minister .
madam chairperson , i move as an amendment :
i am planning the total restructuring of this component which will include inter alia the divisions vehicle administration , legal administration and traffic safety .
i can , however , give the assurance that all additional revenue will be made available purely for road maintenance and upgrading purposes .
as far as taxis are concerned , the drive to convert minibus taxi permits from radius to routed-based permissions continues .
i wish to thank the head of the department of economic affairs , mr carel du preez , for his exceptional management skills .
i would also like to take the opportunity of thanking mr roy petersen and mr mike spence .
we are going into a local government election on 1 november with new structures , a new unicity - new everything .
major overseas investors are spending a great deal of time doing viability and feasibility studies regarding alternatives to an inner-city transport system .
madam chairperson , the second issue i would like to refer to is the question of provision and maintenance of roads .
we should compliment the hon minister of finance and development planning on the money received from the casino licence bid .
we cannot continuously apply a maintenance budget from licence fees , which affects the very people we are trying to help .
the hon minister has alluded to the fact that we do not have enough financial resources for renovations .
originally it was decided to build the road from robertson to worcester up to rooiberg in the second phase .
madam chairperson , we call upon the provincial government to take job creation and poverty alleviation seriously .
they should integrate programmes that address unemployment and poverty alleviation under the department of transport and public works .
the hon minister in the office of the premier does not have the capacity to deal with poverty .
madam chairperson , can we be allowed to listen without interruptions from both sides of the house ?
that is considerably less than the percentage increase on petrol and other things that the national government has announced .
experience shows us that emerging contractors , in the absence of mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation , seldom see the benefits of this .
can hon members imagine what effect that would have on agriculture , the fishing industry and the tourist industry ?
i would like to echo the sentiments of my hon colleague who wished mr spence well on his retirement .
i see that many of these vehicles have a disc stuck on the back , depicting this speed limit .
in closing , i once again congratulate the hon minister on this budget and give it my full support .
what hon members do not know is that it is the roads department whose budget was decreased the most .
if there is no legislation to regulate this , we shall have to regulate it in one way or another .
they were desperate , as they had contacted the hon minister 's department many times , but no maintenance had been forthcoming .
in another instance one needed 5 semi-luxury 35-seater buses and in another 3 semi-luxury 60-seater buses .
he also heard where the problem lay , namely in the cape metropolitan council , which is overall responsible .
i do not think there is a single hon member present who does not have a parking place in one of the garages .
i invite him to come and have a cup of coffee with us on the 9th floor one day .
if i say to hon members that there is trouble ahead , then there is trouble ahead .
the rtmc should be a very great asset for us in the province , if we handle it correctly .
he mentioned that he had observed that women with curlers still in their hair drive around in the vehicles .
there is a possibility that we will be looking at several roads in the province together with the national transport agency .
the head of the department of transport will be able to confirm that the west coast road is on our list of priorities again .
for all the people of the west coast , the western cape , the southern cape , the central karoo , wherever they may be .
i think that the only reason why he asked for a turn to speak was the 25 % increase in licence fees .
the hon member mr gelderblom thanked me , my management team and all the people who work on roads .
( 5 ) further calls on the leader of the dp to withdraw this allegation .
the anc government must either deal with this or face further job losses - there is no other way .
it is correct that it as an efficient communication and data processing tool , has contributed to the rise of the knowledge economy .
companies in this province face the same challenges , perhaps more acutely than companies in many other countries .
the company has a strong export orientation , proving its ability to compete in the world market .
the second company that i want to highlight is cape country furniture , which did not exist three years ago .
we would also hope that provincial institutions will give effect to the partnership between the various spheres of government .
- i have just explained why - who have attempted to resolve the complaints and were unable to do so .
the board is well advanced with the development of a state of the art website , which i am personally extremely excited about .
part of what we are doing here is a start in anticipating where we can change .
" this is what they are doing with the budget allocations they receive from the department and the local authority .
following on the final stakeholders ' workshop to be held in april , a board will be formed to drive the centre .
this will ensure a further saving on our current rental expenditure for which r84,8 million has been budgeted in the coming financial year .
madam chairperson , there is just one thing in the hon minister 's speech that i want to follow up now .
what will make an overseas investor invest in the western cape if there are tax havens in bermuda and in ireland ?
i know the hon minister realises the importance of this , but it was not mentioned in his speech today .
there has never been any intention in asset management to sell off capital assets and get rid of the money .
in the opinion of the new np the unemployment problem still appears to be the greatest challenge in the western cape .
i know that some years ago - hon members must help me here - the province carried out an investigation into red tape .
in passing , i should be much obliged if anyone could tell me which of those recommendations have been implemented .
he appeared to give a progress report that took , as we know , somewhere near an hour and a half .
can individuals discuss the details of hotels adjacent to a convention centre , when they themselves have financial interests in the tourism sector ?
madam chairperson , it gives me pleasure to follow the emerging tony leon groupie !
many under-aged youths spend time in and around the tavern openly drinking and doing drugs .
an example of how this system of community cooperation can be successful , is the forester 's arms in newlands .
the answer given by the hon minister was that sound international practice dictated that he keep his hands off them .
let us forget for a moment about the race prejudice which is still rampant in these bureaux .
africa 's most popular destination is boasting an annual growth rate of 15 % in overseas arrivals over the last decade .
it must be driven by the fact that this would be geared towards development and poverty alleviation in this province as well .
let me identify a number of issues that i would like to raise directly out of the hon minister 's budget speech .
what we must bear in mind is - and i mentioned this initially - that the production system worldwide has been internationalised .
we are of course trying , as a different initiative , to begin to address some of the problems with a one-stop-shop .
one either tries to build a wall around the economy and protect it or one accepts the new situation .
one has to tackle roads , but then one has to directly and proactively address the restructuring of one 's existing economies .
madam chairperson , let me tell hon members what has been the most essential form of disempowerment in this country .
there are people from the private sector who can contribute with extremely valuable expertise that we do not want to lose .
if there are any instances in which the hon member has a problem with the board i will deal with it .
madam chairperson , regarding the hon member mr winde 's comments about illegal outlets , i endorse all of that .
here i have in mind in particular the wheat and wine industries , as well as the deciduous fruit , apple and table grape industries in certain areas .
in the fruit and wine industry mechanisation cannot replace labour totally but instead shows elements of supplementary production factors .
we shall draw up business plans in consultation with the communities , investigate possibilities for private partnerships and call for contributions from communities .
it is for this reason that we must take the initiative and find creative ways to create manual labour .
the results of this research project will also be used to assist new farmers for more effective water consumption .
madam chairperson , this sophistication can be seen from the perspective of farming practices , agricultural products , human resources and management .
owing to this inflexible labour legislation and minimum wages , farmers are increasingly being forced into mechanisation and the unemployment problem is increasing .
in the past at pruning time he employed about 150 workers , but now he has imported a pruning machine .
madam chairperson , the farmers are the only group in the private sector who provide free housing to their labourers .
i appeal to the hon minister to take a delegation - i shall lead the delegation ...
these cries are heard when the hon minister of agriculture gets up and says that land reform must take place dynamically and more quickly .
nothing is said about one equal agricultural sector ; neither in the five-year plan nor today .
it is just a pity that so little is happening and that it is not taking place within a holistic , integrated framework .
madam chairperson , i just wish to refer briefly to certain points , because i must take the time factor into account .
i want to thank the hon minister and his officials for regarding this as a task of top priority .
things are silent again now , but we shall be having an election shortly so once again this will become an election slogan .
and then his deputy minister is arrogant enough to say , " if agriculture were to provide any employment " .
if one takes all these issues into consideration , one will see that we are definitely in for big trouble .
i should like to quote from a report , if time permits , to summarise the situation further .
madam chairperson , it is not for me to judge whether joe seremane is good or bad .
i can give hon members the assurance that the experience i have had of him is positive .
agriculture reaches out - we shall also give assistance to other provinces that are unable to get by .
next i wish to thank the hon member ms phike for the positive tone in which she delivered her speech .
it is not the vote in its entirety ; it is a particular programme under the vote that we would like to identify .
] there are objections and therefore it will appear on the order paper for possible discussion at a later date .
] there are objections and therefore it will appear on the order paper for possible discussion at a later date .
i believe it is appropriate that i make mention of the symbolism of the mini opening ceremony of the western cape parliament .
we already have our sporting heroes , but we also need to be prouder of the many other achievements of our province .
in this way the western cape will develop more effective and sustained public participation initiatives in the provincial parliament and departmental projects .
he is 83 years old , and it is so wonderful that he is able to be with us here today .
there are people like a magistrate at laingsburg who is available 24 hours every day and hears cases .
the national minister of transport must be assisted with his plan to license only larger , standard minibus taxi ' s .
mr speaker , such a step is the first down the slippery slope of the demise of democracy .
this flies in the face of , " letting the people govern " , and makes a mockery of local democracy .
i think they gave up their lives for their communities , not some power hungry individual .
accordingly i should like to extend my sincere thanks to my colleagues in the opposition benches today for their support in this regard .
the bus fare , on the other hand , for 10 trips from khayelitsha to cape town is in the region of r28 .
is it fair on the newly created businesses in the tourism industry which , due to the taxi violence , are unable to trade ?
the township tour operators have taken their tourists elsewhere , perhaps never to place khayelitsha on their itineraries again .
mr speaker , i was disappointed that the government was so quiet when people were dying .
we cannot wait until a crisis occurs ; we must try in a proactive way to prevent situations such as this from arising .
golden arrow transports approximately 160 000 passengers per weekday , of which only a third are currently affected by the taxi violence .
only in this case has the hon minister been given , as he has said , special or extraordinary powers .
i had to obey the decision of the hon premier and the cabinet not to accept the memorandum .
provincial governments are too dependent on central grants to be autonomous in the options they exercise .
more and more central treasury is giving money to provinces as conditional grants , ring-fenced for specific purposes .
] the hon member mr byneveldt put the motion before the house , but he objects the most .
when we speak about firearm control , we must bear in mind that at present there may also be blame for the distribution thereof .
then we can begin to give this relationship of trust some attention , and it will be strong enough to carry successful prosecutions .
in the 1980s these organisations - and i was part of them - were banned because we were being subversive .
among others , i read a book entitled the war of the flea written by carlos marigelo .
no , those hon members did not give that to me ; i do not get anything from them , with respect .
instead of training them in sessions of 50 , they are being trained in sessions of 200 .
( ii ) national land transport transition bill [ b5b-2000 ] .
( xii ) local government : municipal systems bill [ b27-2000 ] .
they will commit desperate political acts and abuse of power , and use the vote to do what they please .
in the constitution there are a number of different clauses which precisely indicate our responsibility and i wish to quote from it .
7 ( 2 ) the state must respect , protect , promote and fulfil the rights in the bill of rights .
" the issues are quite clear : we all supported a representative and participatory democracy and a corruption-free system of voting .
] this whole thing has nothing to do with transparency , accountability , good governance and building democracy .
it was very clear to me that the anc was not satisfied with the good explanation by the director-general .
the iec - yes , i am coming to that in a moment - was constantly assuring provinces that officials would be remunerated .
in the gang culture , if one wishes to become a member of a gang , one has to undergo a certain initiation process .
secondly , the process followed to spend the money or make it available appears to be problematic .
mr speaker , on a point of order : is it permissible to address an hon member , ...
i should like hon members addressing one another by their surnames and avoiding snide remarks .
that letter was written to the national government , and i will quote it to the hon member mr ismail .
the province wrote back to the national government one day later , saying that they had 430 volunteers .
for instance , there is a contention here that teachers could not be mobilised because it would disrupt the matric examinations .
] i do not have the specifics in front of me but i will provide the hon member with the information .
if there is a further proposal to call in the iec or the national government we can do that .
the minister , irrespective of what we are discussing , is accountable for his or her money in that vote .
even a non-answer is a response to a question on the vote .
i asked that question of the director-general and he chose not to answer the question .
that question can be addressed to the hon minister of finance and development planning when we get to his vote .
madam chairperson , my reply to that question is the same as my reply to the previous two questions , ditto .
] i would like to inform the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation that each member has three votes .
madam chairperson , yes , obviously when this was presented i enquired from the department of finance .
i want to explain that the money that was transferred was not money that was lost to the health budget .
madam chairperson , the hon member should put that question to the hon minister of finance and development planning .
it is simple arithmetic to divide r1 000 into r18 000 to get the answer .
madam chairperson , i would like to state that i think this debate is being handled very badly by the chair .
he said it had not and that we had been reimbursed with more than r1,6 million .
madam chairperson , i do not think that it was used or determined at post level , but i can find out .
he managed to save this in such an important vote as planning , local government and housing .
madam chairperson , right at the start of this session i asked you what your time arrangement was .
madam chairperson , can i address you on the question of contempt , because it is coming up time and again ?
madam chairperson , that was an instruction from health that we will assist with manpower in the registration process , ...
the anc hoped in the opening address to hear a little more about a comprehensive urban renewal strategy .
gangs in manenberg have , for example , either " bought " residents or coerced them into providing safe havens for them .
the hon minister of housing will tell me that in this financial year he has already overspent his budget .
they want a commitment from all of us , as well as our peace officers and police officers , to deliver justice .
how improbable that may sound , that is factually correct because of the much more ingrained nature of this phenomenon .
i want to use this opportunity to thank the hon premier for his special word of welcome .
therefore , the department has to be efficient in how it administers and manages the applications for social relief and pension applications .
we acknowledge these advances and the advances which have already been achieved and made by my predecessors .
i also want to congratulate the national minister of health on introducing a pilot study ; it is going to help us .
resources must be distributed in accordance with existing needs on a basis of priority , and be allocated to those areas where crime occurs the most .
we cannot , as is alleged about villiersdorp , have the situation where only towns are patrolled .
mr speaker , afford me the opportunity to congratulate the hon premier on his birthday .
the point to which i should like to react is something he did not mention in his address .
the hon premier made a plea for cooperation with other levels of government and specifically for cooperation with levels of local government .
mr speaker , yesterday during the opening of parliament i once again had a lump in my throat .
the minister is calling for a change in attitude which is essentially what all of us should be supporting .
without any notice to him his house was sold on 13 december 2000 for an amount of r2 635 .
what has happened to the commitment made by the hon premier of a certain amount of free basic services ?
this is not only happening in riebeeck-kasteel and in malmesbury ; it is happening in hermanus and in other local authorities .
well , if he believes this , he is the only person in south africa who believes that time goes backwards .
the current looming crisis hinges around development in the northern section of crossroads known as boystown .
the anc representative there is reimposing this threat , only in a much more insidious way .
that is the anc 's record of service delivery and commitment to democracy in the interests of children in beaufort west .
it is vague on concrete strategies and only full of praise for his government and da colleagues .
let me tell the hon premier that leadership is not claimed ; it is earned through hard work .
the critical challenge for the western cape and south africa as a whole is to transform the lives of poor communities .
i must also , in closing , congratulate the city of cape town for being voted the engen city of the year .
mr speaker , to me it is always a privilege to speak after the deputy speaker .
it is clear from this that the report was initiated by our anc friends on the other side of the house .
however , the hon premier has failed to tell the public where this initiative comes from .
a cautious approach is certainly the correct and scientific manner in which to deal with the issues of mtct treatment .
mr speaker , a number of meetings were held and in 1999 a process to identify beneficiaries was started .
mr speaker , mr noludwe was still the chairperson of the rdp at the time , which he is not now .
i think the other provinces would like to have a premier like the one we have in the western cape .
the eu regulations and requirements in regard to agricultural products are constantly being adapted and have a determining influence on our exports .
that r65 million could have gone to the police to make better policing possible .
accordingly , the number of permanent farm workers have decreased from 8 900 in 1995 to 5 200 in 2000 .
for this reason this government will support 5 200 permanent farm workers with a one-off payout of r400 per worker .
i refer to those who want to see to it that their privileged position in this province continues to be maintained and protected .
mr speaker , the hon premier 's opening address was certainly notable for a number of noble-sounding ideas and also some self-endorsements .
they were recruited there with the promise that they would earn r1 for picking one basket of grapes .
let it be so , then , but the others earned anything up to r48 for a week 's work .
what the anc government is busy with is actually attempting to violate an international patent agreement and intellectual property rights .
] my question to him is : is it not time to replace some spin doctors and propagandists ?
more than 14 000 women have been tested and the 2 000 women who have tested positive have been assisted .
approximately 95 % of all medicine provided by the department of health in south africa is generic medicine .
mr speaker , we have virtually no problems with the department of education and all the other departments .
mr speaker , i once again wish to commend the officials , led by mr langenhoven in this case .
mr speaker , this is actually a delivery appropriation , and it gives me great pleasure to support it .
we are told that r2,650 million is to be spent on cameras between the n2 and the n1 on vanguard drive .
i would firstly like to deal with the r10 million issue and put it into perspective .
] they heard what the hon leader of the opposition spoke about - the difference between the rich and the poor .
madam chairperson , could the hon minister of social services and poverty relief explain what " incorrect component linkages " are ?
if i have my way , the hon member mr dugmore should go and study the judgment of the irene grootboom court case .
on 29 may 2000 mr swart , a bus driver of golden arrow , was shot dead and petrol bombs were thrown at buses .
here in the house twenty days ago we discussed and unanimously approved the amendment of the western cape road transportation act .
that is the position with which we are complying and that is the position that the anc will continue to take .
mr speaker , it is with a tragic sense of dj vu that i participate in this debate today .
the inconvenience , physical and financial , that commuters have experienced over the past number of weeks is totally unacceptable to the udm .
nevertheless , mr speaker , given the complex dynamics of the violence , the hon minister has done reasonably well .
hon members have sent condolences in the house to the families of people who have died in this situation .
which is consistent with what we had already agreed on in the provincial taxi violence task team this province should do .
on 16 may 2000 - 51 days after the transport crisis began - legislation was brought to the house .
i went to see what mr gabs did there , why he was able to close the taxi ranks so easily .
mr speaker , the hon leader of the opposition said we have to call a spade a spade .
she saw that the television cameras were on the hon minister and she wanted to play to the gallery .
we are attending to the applications that are at present before the local road transportation board to finalise them more expeditiously .
for this reason i want to tell hon members that nothing that i do , is done in isolation .
i will therefore allow the hon member mr ramatlakane to move his motion without notice at that time .
] there are objections and therefore it will appear on the order paper for possible discussion at a later date .
i am sure that in the bigger picture it will bring us into line with premier world destinations .
indeed , people in the cape 's tourism industry have waited for 20 years for the development of a dedicated international convention centre .
how can anybody claim that the shareholders ' agreement is not germane to the issue before us ?
construction commences in december 2000 and the convention centre will be opening during the first quarter of 2003 .
within less than three years cape town will be competing against centres which are members of the historic conference centres of europe .
south africa 's position as a leader in sub-saharan africa is not dissimilar to that of australia within the south-east asia region .
we did not want to look at this because it was not relevant , yet we sign documents with such inconsistencies !
we hope that the house will support us on a stronger position on affirmative action policies in the convention centre .
the first was the partnership not only between the public authorities , but also with the private sector .
the hon member reminded me a little of somebody who is desperately looking for a fig leaf .
he did a sterling job and made sure that the company complies through independent valuation with those empowerment requirements .
we have people who are hotel owners on the board , because they know the tourism industry and they participate in it .
that is why it should comply with both subsections ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of that clause .
madam chairperson , we must not think that we are more than we are in this regard .
the original text - and that is why i need clarity on this now - covered both agreements .
is what the hon member ms essop saying true , or is she flying a kite ?
the hon minister must not question my integrity and my participation on that issue ; it is there .
the argument of the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism was that it was confined to the convenco agreement .
madam chairperson , there is a reworded text , but there is no official amendment for the reworded text .
i will not read the whole clause , but i would like to repeat the amended version of this part .
( xiii ) local government municipal electoral bill [ b35-2000 ] .
( xiv ) general intelligence law amendment bill [ b36-2000 ] .
house of representatives , had been paid at a higher rate than the contractual rate as determined in 1992 .
( 1 ) noting the return of mr h j kriel to public political life ; and
if that is so , then the whip of the anc should have rectified the matter for the speaker at the table .
] they came back very apologetically and said they had not intended to boycott the meetings .
what actually happened here is that we did not give them what they really wanted .
sir , i want to congratulate the hon minister on having perpetuated the element of the collective executive .
sir , the argument on the table is whether cape town should have a mayor with executive powers , yes or no .
it will make a mockery of the principle of broadening of democracy and of the addressing of real community needs .
" my answer to him was , " yes , we shall win it , but the issue here is one of principle .
that is what raymond wacks and others contend guides many south african judges - there are exceptions .
amongst others the late prof etienne mureinik , the erstwhile advisor to the dp , held similar views on the judiciary .
therefore it would be tragic if this unacceptable practice were to be continued in present-day south africa by any political party .
the udm , in pursuit of the vision of a totally independent legal system , accepts the pronouncements by the judiciary .
i agree with the hon member mr lewis , who pointed out the difference between criticism and interference .
in what way is the anc doing everything it can to support the judiciary ?
" after the court case smuts ngoyama , who is a highly placed anc official , said that it was a racially motivated judgment .
mr speaker , i would say that this cold war warrior is not doing anything to make a contribution .
] it was tony leon 's father , and tony leon himself was an active propagandist for the south african defence force .
how do they think it must feel for a judge to hear day after day that he is an apartheid judge ?
get rid of them then , and replace them with the very handy puppets that would then also hang new np members .
( d ) believes that such utterances contribute to a climate of instability and division within the province ; and
the poor hon minister of local government , who is a junior minister , has to react when other senior ministers speak .
in fact , the hon minister of transport and works was the chairperson of the bishop lavis branch .
there are fewer whites than there are elephants in zimbabwe , and he continues blaming whites !
they have been sending flowers and peeping through keyholes and desperately " vry " -ing up the new np , but that has failed .
this is not proper debate , and there are a few hon members that will really have to behave themselves .
it sees itself as a big bucket of political disinfectant - they can take anybody and dip him in .
] we say to them that when they raise the spectre of zimbabwe , they are speaking about " kaffers " .
the only people who shout about it are those who represent the worst aspects of white reaction and white right-wing politics .
it is crystal clear to me in the house that the president 's two nations debate is applicable here .
mr speaker , by their posters they have tried to inject the fear of hell into our people .
furthermore , small , medium and micro businesses are also a way in which persons in the lower income group gain access to economic opportunities .
applications for bank loans by this sector are usually turned down on the basis of credit controls , the business plan or inadequate collateral .
mr speaker , there are two broad constraints on starting and running a small business in south africa .
a research team in the anc is now taking the complaints and turning them into case studies .
mr speaker , we visited athlone industria and met with 30 business people in that area over lunch .
mr speaker , when it comes to retail development in black areas the banks say it is oversubscribed .
they have been told to change the mix because the retail sector in mitchells plain is oversubscribed .
( vi ) local government municipal electoral bill [ b35b-2000 ] .
2.2 consequently , the department considered certain rental options offered by three suppliers and found that they were not acceptable .
- the time pressures , the cost consideration and the urgent appeal form the education heads left management with very little option .
- the specific action was therefore not due to any negligence or ignorance on the part of anyone concerned ;
- there was no intent on the part of anyone to harm the interests of the administration .
2.8 having heard and considered evidence regarding the above , the committee wishes to express its concern that -
( resolutions 2-11 , 13-16 and 18-24 ) ( announcements , tablings and committee reports no. 14-2000 , dated 22 june 2000 ) .
( i ) directorate of special operations bill [ b39-2000 ] .
that is to be done by the whips , who should inform the different parties about these arrangements that are made .
no one in the house can deny that the 1979 values surely do not reflect the pattern of property values today .
the dp in its constituencies questioned the valuation procedure and in particular the issue of on-site investigations .
i would like to commend the hon member mr mckenzie for bringing this forward to us today .
but not all the financial problems can be laid at the door of poor management and selective debt collection .
municipalities have also been trying to provide or renew infrastructure that was neglected or underdeveloped in the past .
the regulations must be open , consultative and fair and be based on what we believe to be the following principles .
madam speaker , the da will not accept rising public expenditure while real delivery to the poor drops .
madam speaker , i wish to address a few matters which specifically emerge in this new bill .
madam speaker , i wish to refer to a few good points that emerge in this piece of legislation .
one can examine this draft legislation very carefully and think it is a fine bill with certain defects .
if hon members are not satisfied that he made the announcement , they should be calm about it .
some areas obtained a discount of 1 % , 2 % , 6 % , 7 % , 9 % or 100 % .
this year pinelands had a 15 % increase whereas some of the other areas have no increases .
they also have the responsibility to tell the public that corrections have been made .
it is very interesting that the hon member mr mckenzie referred to certain areas in the city of tygerberg .
on 1 august this year the cape supreme court was informed that attacks on farms and smallholdings in the western cape were on the increase .
they were prepared to hand over the money and they were brutally killed in front of their 8-year-old and 6-year-old children .
madam speaker , let me say i am not passing the buck to private citizens .
this is the highest figure per group , followed by the saps with 153 per 100 000 of the population .
i also wish to ask that for once he gives us an answer on the drought in the southern cape .
that the criteria with regard to provincial cabinet outcomes be amended with particular focus on providing services to the poor .
( resolutions 2-11 , 13-16 and 18-24 ) ( announcements , tablings and committee reports no. 14-2000 , dated 22 june 2000 ) .
( i ) directorate of special operations bill [ b39-2000 ] .
you are the speaker of the house and not the speaker of the hon minister of social services .
mr speaker , i am very pleased that the anc supports the western cape eighth gambling and racing amendment bill .
thirdly , we have the development of an awareness of , and a responsiveness to , the socio-economic impact that gambling has .
eventually in 1998 the spm appointed an attorney , mr van niekerk , to consider these matters .
it was first considered by the executive committee of the south peninsula municipality on 16 february 1999 .
when one looks at the speakers ' list it seems that the anc are talking to themselves .
shopping centres - not one shopping centre , sir - are being erected in the south peninsula without any building plans being approved .
] we know that he plays to the gallery , but it is all empty boasting and he knows it .
mr speaker , can you ask the hon premier to apologise and withdraw the statement ?
i wish to quote from a letter written to us by the secretary of the task team , which says :
mr speaker , i would like to propose that we then appoint an ad hoc committee to investigate this matter .
( 1 ) in terms of section 136 ( 2 ) ( b ) of the national constitution " ...
i would rather like to deal with the subsequent act in relation to our breaking the news as the anc .
we know the companies act and that is why the anc has never raised the private sector interests on the board .
why did he not in his affidavit , as he said on cape talk radio , declare his family trust interests ?
it was last updated on 5 september 2000 after the hon minister had declared his interests in the convenco board .
the " business as usual " of the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism will be scrutinised .
mr speaker , i would like to know if the hon minister would be prepared to take a question .
certainly , sir , from this side of the house we will at all times protect the integrity of the convention centre .
we have not even alleged corruption on the part of the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism .
i do not think that the hon minister of local government and development planning has a hotel on the waterfront .
they are controlling it with only the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism and the hon minister of community safety .
if he was part of the decision , did he ask for a three star or a five star hotel to accompany the convention centre ?
mr speaker , it shows how one can pick up bad habits from the other side of the house .
mr speaker , the public expect a razor-sharp opposition , but what they have is a blunt and desperate opposition .
( ii ) bills of exchange amendment bill [ b47-2000 ] .
( vii ) national health laboratory service bill [ b52-2000 ] .
( ix ) south african weather service bill [ b54-2000 ] .
i trust that the hon members of his party will convey to him what i have said in the house .
sir , if my calculations are correct , nine bombs have exploded in our city this year .
we must tackle it full on - not from the side , but head-on .
hon members will recall that a great deal of success was achieved with operation good hope after the intervention of president mbeki .
mr speaker , on behalf of this house i want to wish all those injured by the recent bomb explosion a speedy recovery .
since the codesa negotiations we have started to establish a new culture of talks and negotiation in this country .
if there is any information about the cause of this abomination , the government must share it with the people .
it is signed , " anti-pagad muslim " and the person implores , " ( please use my psuedonym ) " .
thirdly , all aspects of anti-terrorist policy and operations must be accountable to parliament .
finally , mr speaker , i wish to convey my sincere thanks to all the hon members who participated in the debate .
i trust that we shall continue to have it in future in regard to this matter and other matters as well .
( 1 ) notes the racism , whether specific or by implication , which still prevails in the western cape ;
they must tell us now whether peter marais is a " hotnot " minister or also a minister for blacks .
] i have the person 's fax number here , because when one sends a fax it can be traced .
we have also been very interested to hear the da 's outcry when we unmasked their own racism .
yes , mr speaker , when the da state publicly that our pamphlet is hate speech , they are right .
they desperately need to turn the tiny minority of white south africans into the scapegoat for their own increasingly obvious policy failures .
the anc 's affirmative action policy , mr speaker , is really a " jobs for pals " policy .
i believe that it is difficult for the coalition government to admit that in this regard we may have failed .
in its implementation of affirmative action the anc often discriminates against the people that they have to benefit .
now , mr speaker , i want to deal simultaneously with the speeches by the hon members mr lewis and ms essop .
it is true that affirmative action has to take place , but we must also move in the direction of empowering action .
i will now allow the hon member mr jacobs to raise a point of order on the motion .
the point is that the anc is not racist because we identify cases where racism occurs on farms .
mr speaker , this is a motion which deserves the support of all the hon members of the house .
the anc does not want him with them , but we do not want him with us either .
at the time of liberation one of the basic and justifiable expectations was that black farmers would gain access to fertile agricultural land .
what we do not need is high-handed and undemocratic action by any other role-player - especially the state !
] it is quite clear that exploitation , inhuman treatment , abuse , in my definition of it , is visible on that farm .
mr speaker , i put the question to the hon leader of the opposition on behalf of the community at large .
they should listen to what i am saying - 80 % of the people found guilty were black people .
this is an effort which would not benefit four people only , but would benefit all the people of the south cape .
( iii ) transnet pension fund amendment bill [ b57-2000 ] .
( v ) transnet pension fund amendment bill [ b57b-2000 ] .
( vii ) construction industry development board bill [ b59-2000 ] .
that provision be made for the audi alteram partem rule to be inserted in subsection 19 ( 2 ) .
( vii ) bills of exchange amendment bill [ b47b-2000 ] .
( xi ) national health laboratory service bill [ b52b-2000 ] .
( xv ) construction industry development board bill [ b59b-2000 ] .
the unauthorised expenditure amounting to r3 862 995,10 arising from excess expenditure on the vote was considered .
mr speaker , we must also see to it that the nature of these questions may not be repetitive .
after all that detailed non-explanation , they then have the temerity to go ahead and authorise the expenditure !
] mr speaker , could the hon minister of education please refrain from constantly interjecting ?
i would like to take the opportunity of congratulating the hon minister of transport and works .
in cape town it is the worst kept secret that hundreds of teachers were deployed in the voter registration process .
mr speaker , it was samuel johnson who said , " patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel .
] was it at any time meant to apply to any member in the house ?
of this payment was to ensure that the new np would at least receive votes in this province .
they congratulated him for giving them the answers , but what happened when his vote was put ?
r10,8 million was allocated to transport and works out of increased motor car licence fees and r735 000 to agriculture out of various sources .
the provincial parliament 's vote has received another r633 000 for the improvement of benefits for members .
( a ) stop the support for multinational pharmaceutical companies that impede the importation of cheaper generic drugs ;
when i consider this , i certainly cannot agree that the hon premier is the premier of all .
mr speaker , i wish to congratulate the hon premier on what i believe was a very constructive opening address .
we will have to work on our relationship with the unicity and more cooperative government in all spheres of government .
we would like to congratulate the hon minister of community safety on the vision of 1 000 municipal police officers in various areas .
the apparent reason for this is that we have not supported the da on certain issues at national level .
we need to understand that right at this moment there are cars parked at the casino in which children are locked .
three important categories of exploitation and oppression have characterised social and economic development and discourse over the centuries .
and it is backed up by the distasteful jokes about women of the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism .
the second , race , is mentioned only by way of the fallacious call to stop a discourse on debate on race .
i , too , have certain concerns about casinos and they have to be watched very carefully in this province .
i am afraid the hon members on that side of the house have a lack of understanding of market forces .
it was 18 months ago that the leader of the labour party came in with an unbelievable majority .
yes , we are against certain areas of the labour legislation , such as areas that prevent foreign and national investment .
cosatu continues to be over-concerned with the employed , but they leave the unemployed in total misery .
in the past elections - and this is a fact - there was a massive coloured vote against the anc .
they are so small , and they have even been kicked out of the council , but they still want to climb up to them .
mr speaker , on a point of order : i have never been to houston , texas , in my life .
when the hon member mr mckenzie was speaking , he said , " you have had your chance .
] and that while we in the western cape are ready to begin approved projects amounting to virtually r800 million .
] yes , i am going to read it out , and the hon member with the dirt track does not know what it is about .
the recent local government elections and results in the western cape herald a time of hope for many people .
mr chairperson , as i have said we are not going to overcome these problems by ignoring the issues .
mr chairperson , it has now become common on the da side to quote the past of the anc .
] all this is done to build opposition to the present anc as it exists today .
when are we going to see the premier of the da acknowledge the role of the gools in this province ?
when is he going to recognise the role that moses kotane played in district six in building racial unity ?
is that the line that he is going to use to build national unity and racial tolerance in this country ?
we have a wonderful opportunity in the next few years to work closely with the new unicity .
when that day dawns , less will be said about racism in this house and in other houses ...
the second adjustments estimate is r111 000 , of which r40 000 has been allocated to the improvement of conditions of services for staff .
for the hon member mr king to explain it or try to justify it is out of order .
what is interesting is that the anc received more votes than the da in most of these hung councils .
he withdrew the party 's money from the books - we are still looking for the bank book .
one detects , in each of those areas , the feeble efforts made by the anc members during the election campaign .
i went up to them and asked them why they were walking around in the streets - this happened two weeks ago .
the process of consultation on the part of the national minister for provincial and local government concerns me too .
they have to survive on r80 000 a year , as a consequence of the decisions of those hon members .
the better we do , the younger i feel , and i must say i feel very young indeed - somewhat stricken with flu , but very young .
mr speaker , i agree with him that we all have to work together to create a self-sustaining society .
i agree that hiv / aids is certainly a much bigger threat to south africa than any potential aggressor .
this is because i believe that the more people who climb on board the delivery train , the better our performance will be .
there is one aspect of the address by the hon leader of the opposition for which he deserves favourable mention .
i am talking about the unemployed single mothers who first have to look after their children before sparing a thought for themselves .
it is a shocking insult to the jewish community of south africa and it is a shameful insult to herzlia .
no one who understands anything about education in the western cape can say that harold cressy is a predominantly muslim school .
the fact of the matter is that at this very moment there are three muslim teachers at herzlia school .
if they have a shred of dignity left , they will insist that the hon minister of education resigns .
i am sure that what is going to happen now is that there is going to be some kind of witch-hunt in the department .
the entire cabinet going to pacaltsdorp was an outstanding example of this beginning to happen .
tuesday , 8 february 2000 introduced a new year and a new century - a new millennium has come into view .
women and children , who have increasingly become the victims of violence and crime , beg and implore him for his attention .
i hope that the manenbergs , the khayelitshas , the blue downses and the guguletus heard the hon premier .
let me , however , quote what lorraine braid said in die burger on 14 february - that is , yesterday .
i want to assure him that his efforts do not go unnoticed , certainly not by my three desks .
to achieve this , we cannot overemphasise the need for integrated interdepartmental , intersectoral socio-economic upliftment projects and programmes .
i repeat , to this end , we would like to encourage a transformation , gender , disability , youth and aids-sensitive budget .
of course , the anc is the organisation which led the struggle to introduce democracy to the country .
in fact , this is the very advice that the government has been given by its legal advisers .
our first contention is that the campaign is being run directly from the office of the premier , through the director-general .
i hope that he has had a damascus experience and now realises that we are in a sorry state .
we are presently engaged in a debate and the party of the hon member still has other speakers .
the hon minister , and no one else , is to blame for the lack of quality teaching in that school .
mr speaker , the hon premier made no mention of the hiv / aids epidemic in this province .
the hon premier should be the leader of all the people , not the leader of a few .
i am mindful that a certain amount of money has been allocated to set up a database on street children .
i hope operation fire stop will also make provision for training members of the squatter community as civilian fire-fighters .
if we speak to the people outside , they ask us how the anc are going to govern when they take over .
if the new np were on our side in terms of colour they would know what it feels like .
they have it within them to begin to believe their hearts and can still change their allegiance .
if the hon premier is a good politician , he will know when the time has come to go .
] i must tell hon members , though , that there was also a seriously jarring note in the form of an anc-leaning group .
however , let me tell hon members what is going on in the cape town city council , where the anc is in control .
] that was in blue downs , the area represented by that hon member who has so much to say .
mr speaker , on a point of order : i am very disturbed by the remarks of the hon minister .
who have benefited from these achievements and which communities benefited or are still benefiting from these achievements ?
madam speaker , in essence i am saying that we need to outsource all non-core police functions to the private sector .
] however , the peter marais we know is not a man who will allow himself to be beaten down .
] they are always bused here and then they stand in front of the building with a few placards ...
i want to convey my sincere gratitude to the nehawu members in the traffic department for the contribution that they made .
however , six years down the line they want us to forget that apartheid ever existed in this country !
i had come to launch a branch , for the information of the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs .
i have managed to raise the consciousness of my white brother in swellendam ; that is the point .
or , on second thoughts , they do not have to see it - they experience it every day .
i asked one young girl from mt fletcher in the eastern cape why she had bought a forged report card .
mr speaker , is the hon minister of education prepared to take a question about guguletu police station ?
did the hon premier read the article of mr thabo mabaso in the cape argus of 10 february 2000 ?
mr speaker , the hon premier has praised the hon minister of education as the saviour of the coalition .
can we talk about the realities in the house and what is really happening in our constituencies ?
are the hon minister and the hon premier aware of the overcrowding in the schools in our townships ?
if she wants , she can telephone my office and i will give her the number of the human rights commission .
following the hon premier 's opening address there was some criticism in the media , according to the cape argus .
i know that the anc is not particularly pleased , because their prime candidate did not make it .
i do not remember having seen a word in the media from the anc in this regard .
it is in afrikaans , but essentially it says : " stop arresting ' dronkies ' .
do those hon members know that 1 million jobs have been lost in this country since they took over ?
i am not sure whether philippi , where the family was wiped out by aids , is part of this province .
the hon member ms mqulwana may not tell another hon member to shut up .
this has gone so far that a company as large as volkswagen is already threatening to withdraw its people from south africa .
many of the clinics and community health centres in the western cape already conduct free testing , and further testing sites have been identified .
interestingly , there can be no physical signs of a sexually transmitted disease , but one can carry it .
we do not get a cent for that , but in this province we will overexpend to serve the poor .
i believe that today we should give serious consideration to proposals which amount to a policy of firm action .
applying affirmative action . they are determining a minimum wage , so that farm workers are also covered .
- and so on , without addressing the real issues facing the province .
mr speaker , only 12 % of all serious crimes reported in 1997-98 have led to convictions .
we are concerned that the latest crime statistics from the saps show that crime is at its highest level .
i want to thank the hon leader of the opposition for elevating the level of the debate .
madam speaker , constable van lill left mr baadjies in the police van from a quarter to seven until half past 10 .
i want to invite him again to report that matter to the police and to lay a charge .
opportunistically he comes here and quotes selectively what was said by the hon leader of the opposition .
when the anc objected to that , the new np turned around and said , " no , hold on .
the party-driven registration programme leading to the election campaign has , of course , been the order of the day during this debate .
i saw the hon premier with a booklet on his desk , and now he has put it away .
they are unable to come up with anything concrete in the form of criticism or advice on the matter .
in relative terms the reduced transfers will continue until the target year 2003-04 , when universal equity should be attained .
revenue constraints include poor economic growth , continuing restraint within the equitable share formula and limited own revenue sources .
this projected surplus will be utilised to defray accumulated debt obligations arising out of over-expenditures and revenue shortfalls of previous financial years .
government 's ability to increase spending on social services and infrastructure is severely limited by rising personnel costs .
mr speaker , there are four principal elements of our infrastructural programme which i wish to draw to the attention of the house :
all of the above conditions imply that any further losses in income or expenditure overruns are solely for health 's account .
the accounts of the provincial administration : western cape for 1996-97 : vote 6 - health [ pr 32 / 1999 ] ;
transversal matters at local governments in the province of the western cape for the 1996-97 financial year [ pr 45 / 1999 ] ;
i have instructed the same delegation also to assess the damage in the flooded areas in the western cape .
in the absence of an approved business plan the funds should be rolled over to the existing poverty relief programmes within the department .
the paragraph under the heading , " vote 9 : environmental and cultural affairs and sport " , reads , and i quote :
they mention nothing in the report about voter registration , so i take it that they agree with that too .
in the budget we can only expect a 4,6 % contribution to the total revenue of this province this year .
the new np takes cognisance of unemployment in various segments of the business sector , which can have a negative impact ...
or , in marrying objectives and outputs , two policies referring to previously adopted policies ?
the mtef has been adopted , but it is scandalous that a policy-driven process has only been adopted by one department .
with this amount of money we would immediately be able to employ 7 000 to 8 000 policemen per month .
mr speaker , i should like to congratulate the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation on his birthday today .
they have been harping on that since they saw it , and i do not know when it is going to break .
we can hear from the sounds on the other side that the anc are not so bitter any more .
i want to ask the hon minister to go out there and see how this business has been camouflaged .
for example , they referred to absence of policy frameworks , business plans and plans to build equity at the micro level .
however , this alone will not help us to address the manifold challenges in regard to service delivery .
in the early 1990s the schools in the old part of mitchells plain , westridge and rocklands began to empty .
] the budget was not supported last year and it may not be supported next year .
i believe that the questions asked , in the main , and the deliberations were of a very high standard .
that hon member should know it too well , but i will make sure that he wears a red cap .
i venture to suggest that the same would happen to the idea of the hon member mr louis .
i am concerned about what the hon member mr isaacs said about gauteng-based workers in casinos .
madam chairperson , we have taken note of some of the points of criticism raised by the opposition .
this is borne out by growing crime statistics and growing abuse and violence against women , children and our senior citizens .
a day such as international women 's day calls for serious reflection and a firm stand against violence .
the transformation process in our province was therefore revisited and a priority focus has been placed on further reform initiatives .
the bus transport schemes are among the biggest headaches for the department of education and a number of initiatives have achieved success .
the governor of upper austria , dr phringer , has just paid me a visit to give further impetus to several joint upliftment ventures .
one can have political freedom , but for it to be meaningful it is dependent on economic empowerment .
in the first place there is the marketing of the activities of the desks , that i should like to focus on .
at this juncture i want to quote what the hon member mr strachan said on tuesday , 15 february 2000 .
madam chairperson , i just want to know whether the hon minister would be prepared to answer a question .
within this new environment the branch : corporate services will continue to support provincial departments across the board .
litigation matters and the management thereof will now also assume the status of a critical functional area of the component .
communication services will also have to provide strategic guidance to align communication efforts for the administration as a whole .
male politicians , bureaucrats , academics and military officers have dominated institutions , conferences and the way of life in the post-apartheid era .
how does the hon minister think that women will be advanced if she still talks about formulating policies ?
may i congratulate the unit on the excellent work performed so far in retrieving taxpayers ' money .
regarding civil recovery , in his speech the hon premier made reference to this matter , so i will not repeat it .
] we should open this area beyond that of the cabinet to all our members , madam chairperson .
we know what our choice would be , madam chairperson - it is that of merit and non-racial change .
perhaps the hon premier could explain to us why the honours have not yet been awarded in the province .
who is going to sit down and scratch their heads and say , " i can do this , i can do that " ?
in each and every department , one needs to set up a mechanism to monitor whether gender issues are being appreciated and addressed .
i therefore cannot blame anyone for at least attempting to correct the imbalances .
she said that she had a business plan and the hon premier also said she had such a plan .
that is what they say - if we implement affirmative action , that is what is going to happen to this country .
mr chairperson , on a point of order : could the chair protect the hon member ms brown against me ?
mr chairperson , it might not be only the poor , but it is 99,8 % of the poor .
i would like to thank the hon member dr van zyl for her positive response with regard to what we are doing .
they know that they are spreading untruths around here about the business plans , our strategy and whatever we have in place .
the hon member mr louis , who is currently in the chair , is a very capable member of this house .
when one evaluates what the hon member said , then this is something one can bear in mind .
] has that hon member heard what the hon member mr marais said about his colleague beside him ?
] just over a month ago , i addressed the federation of university women of africa , all academics .
in south africa , just in our part of the region , 1 500 people are being infected with the virus every day .
i thank the hon member mr silke for his contribution , especially in relation to the western cape and international agreements .
at least i know that when he says he supports the vote , it is genuine and comes from the heart .
] no , we have not worked out the plan regarding how to communicate what is necessary .
we are going to do it to empower people , and then see if those hon members get the same ...
] at least i give her credit for sometimes listening , and if she does not listen , she reads .
no. the hon member must understand that we are with upper austria , and the majority there are christian democrats .
remuneration of public office bearers amendment bill [ b 11-2000 ] .
in the absence of an approved business plan the funds should be rolled over to the existing poverty relief programmes within the department .
the douglas report indicated that parliament should request r9 million more than was originally voted for this year .
the telephone allowance for members , which will include a cellphone contract , has been considerably increased , as has secretarial assistance .
they include an intern from canada , two interns from germany and two interns from the university of stellenbosch .
the management body will include , apart from the speaker and his deputy , a small group of senior members and the secretary .
in conclusion , madam chairperson , i believe that our parliament should be known as a " working parliament " .
this parliament belongs to the western cape and its people , and even more so , of course , to the mother city and its people .
practices are then accepted unquestioningly as gospel , while their origins were , to say the least , artificially simulated .
a simple head-count will show that the top management of the provincial parliament , by and large , remain male and white .
the mission of this department , as stated in the new gold book , reads as follows , and i quote :
there is a grey area around the specific duties of assistants to chairpersons when it comes to party-political work .
with the theft of our answering facility , we have a very definite shortfall with regard to our service and professionalism .
the shortage of computer and it facilities is inexcusable , let alone the parking problems the legislature staff are experiencing .
hon members will recall that the media formed part of my first portfolio as minister of public works .
there are many aspects in this budget that can be commended , and the speaker has highlighted some of those .
that constraint is imposed by rule 85 ( 3 ) , and we will move that that rule be reconsidered .
if i had had to deal with the debate on this vote in the past , it would have been much more difficult - i know that .
hon members will be able to make their inputs , and we will see if it is necessary to do that .
the secretarial allowance came up in the speeches of the hon members messrs louis , williams and lewis .
the hon member mr louis also referred to the r60 000 available for the different committees .
a set of four photographs costs r12 and r5 is the payment for an application for an id book .
yesterday the hon premier said that everything they were doing in voter registration was completely legal .
all the vacant posts in the subdirectorate : consumer services and fair trade have been filled in the course of this year .
( b ) the costs were borne by many different agencies across national , local and provincial budgets ; and
( 4 ) what are the financial implications of ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) for the wced ?
( 1 ) during 1999 the following steps were taken in the redeployment process in educational institutions in the western cape :
right-sizing , based on these establishments but with adjustments for 2000 if necessary , were completed on 29 february 2000 .
( 5 ) on wednesday i will be making a submission to the cabinet on progress with this legislation .
the first annual report we received was for 1997-98 , but we have still not received the 1996-97 annual report .
in a spatial planning category b - a buffer zone - it is proposed that the emphasis should be on conservation .
mr speaker , as i have said in reply to my questions , the responsibility is that of the council .
( 1 ) i am not sure which " investigation " the hon member mr strachan is referring to .
in the meantime the current implementation processes continue with go-live dates for the three academic hospitals planned for june and july 2000 .
mr speaker , with your indulgence , i would like to ask the hon minister of finance and development planning the following .
we are in the process of consolidating old accident data , prior to 1 october 1999 , into the provincial accident data base .
mr speaker , adjacent to the r300 there should be fencing so that people do not walk over the road .
mr speaker , the fence was erected , and almost all of the fence that was erected has been broken down and taken away .
it is really impossible , even with the wisdom of solomon , to remember all those municipalities .
we believe that the world has become a global village and that south africa has become part of that global village .
mr speaker , it is a great pity that all of a sudden i also have powers in regard to the press .
] give it a chance - we have only just passed the act and the regulations have just been finalised .
this training includes amongst other things : access control ; area control ; observation ; patrolling ; searching ; record-keeping ; identification of explosive devices ; etiquette and protocol .
mr speaker , the answer is that that submission was submitted while i was at the indaba in durban .
every morning , with the assistance of the police and members the army , from 04 : 00 onwards there are road blocks .
mr speaker , the western cape government has been invited to the world economic forum currently being held in durban .
] the issue is being investigated and when it has been completed i am sure that a report will come out .
mr victor mcotshana passed away on 31 july 2000 , allegedly as a consequence of the appalling living conditions on the farm .
if this had to happen as a consequence of appalling living conditions , then thousands of people would be dying every day in this province .
( c ) although he was not working , mr mcotshana received wages and food until his death .
while other occupants kept the other houses in good condition , mr mcotshana neglected himself and his house .
mr speaker , it is quite clear that the farm owner in this case was not inhuman or brutal .
i think that this debate is happening here precisely because he is clearly a prominent new np member in that area .
this farm owner did not cause suffering and he also took no pleasure in the pain of others .
mr speaker , in other sectors of the economy it is not easy to make the same connections .
among the most important elements are the constitution , the public service act , the labour relations act , the employment equity act and the public service regulations .
we spend r14 million at a senior management level when , arguably , what this province needs is a number of staff at service delivery level .
mr speaker , on a point of order : may an hon member say , " he is a liar " ?
] that hon member climbed aboard the gravy train just recently , and now he is already smooth and shiny .
( 1 ) whether scientific methods have been used in the past to demarcate where taxi ranks are to be located ;
the problem is that the national department of transport cannot decide exactly what the be legal campaign is .
on the day an additional 17 000 commuters actually took buses outside of khayelitsha or the train .
promises have been made by comm selebi , by the national minister of transport and by the national minister of defence .
we have a security crisis in our province and our country which simply cannot afford petty political bickering .
( 2 ) whether a copy of the reasons and any official press releases regarding the matter can be provided ?
( a ) the reasons are set out in a media statement issued by the former minister on 26 july 2000 .
( 2 ) a copy of the media statement referred to in ( 1 ) ( a ) is attached .
there is enough classroom space in all of those schools in beaufort west to accommodate all the african pupils in beaufort west .
when the 1994-98 report is tabled details of the categories , amounts and interested parties contained therein will be available .
the 1994-98 report was further delayed as a result of investigations into irregularities in this connection .
what is the proposed date for the implementation of the regulations of the western cape planning and development act ?
mr speaker , i am a little unclear regarding the unconstitutionality of the western cape planning and development act .
i will have to consider the matter very seriously and see what should absolutely be the correct form of address .
that the house proceed to dispose of questions for oral reply , with the restriction of three supplementary questions per question .
mr speaker , i have stated quite expressly here that i will allow no form of discrimination .
( 2 ) why these poor indicators still persist , despite the dramatic increase in the budget ; and
we now unquestionably have the best tb programme in the country and we are now curing more people than ever before .
the trading account system is in operation at karl bremer hospital and we will be expanding the project to other institutions .
our revised strategy around hiv / aids , tb and diseases of lifestyle has been widely acclaimed and accepted by cabinet .
i asked if the hon minister of education is aware that such investigations have taken place at schools .
mr speaker , could the leader of the house indicate to us what " an administrative oversight " is .
( 3 ) how many meetings did the provincial property committee have and what was the outcome of the meetings ; and
we approached ms mamon for the task team , but she declined for the same reasons .
i am now able to announce that i also appointed mr thabo mashologu and ms beryl kerr to the task team .
mr speaker , i would then like to know who was responsible for the press statement issued in this regard .
if the hon member can tell me where the hitches are , especially with allpay , we will investigate it .
it came to my attention after i had addressed the first letter to the hon member mr ramatlakane .
there is a tendency on his part to make excuses for a number of things , including the convention centre .
however , the board has made it perfectly clear that it is necessary to come within the budget of r320 million .
this process is not yet complete and will continue to run in parallel with the design development process .
there is also active recruitment by companies in other countries such as the usa , united kingdom , canada and new zealand .
outpatients seen by the chso increased from 1,5 million in 1996 to 3,1 million in 1999-2000 .
a vigorous recruitment campaign is being pursued in conjunction with uwc and bursaries are awarded to as many pharmacy students as possible .
according to data received from the department of state expenditure the administration employs 203 employees with disabilities .
i am , however , answering the question put by the hon member ms vantura .
with regard to section ( 2 ) of the question , this information has been requested from the saps in the western cape .
the cmc is considering expanding the dial-a-ride project across metropolitan cape town .
( 3 ) the national department of education has allocated r2,297 million to the wced for the current financial year .
as early as last week , before the anc even had their march in the streets of cape town ...
i would like to say to the hon leader of the opposition that we realise there are problems .
we have empowered our people so that they can have a say in the government that will govern them .
in the process 330 000 people were able to obtain bar-coded identification documents and almost 300 000 people were registered and re-registered .
also , this is a question that the hon member should actually have referred to the hon minister of community safety .
according to rule 13 , the opening address will be placed on the order paper by the secretary for debate from tomorrow onwards .
however , i think we can expect feedback to the effect that scof will no longer be discussing vote 2 .
actually , by the time that the education personnel found themselves there , it was time for them to go .
from what the director , ms petersen , said , i understand that something will be introduced in the place of those grants .
it has been extremely well handled and it gives me pleasure to support the western cape second adjustments appropriation bill .
of course , he did not accept that , because one of the jobs i would have given him was policing .
the hon leader of the opposition and everybody else are aware that for a year now i have been quoted on this .
if i did not care about the poor , do those hon members think i would have followed that road ?
however , it is better to have egg on one 's face than nothing in one 's stomach .
the funds and jobs derived from the gaming industry are ultimately meant for the poorest of the poor .
i was at the police station on the sunday and flew by helicopter over manenberg and guguletu , but never ...
mr speaker , i would like to thank the cabinet and everybody else who has made a contribution to this debate .
an environmental forum has been established and an environmental impact study has been completed and handed over to the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs .
the project should be completed at the end of june and the total cost will be r18,5 million .
one of the promises was that the black mack pipeline would not in future be used for diversion .
the kramat of sheikh yusuf is situated in the area and receives over 300 000 visitors a year .
mr speaker , one accepts the announcements made by the hon minister of local government today .
mr speaker , the cape metropolitan council took this project over in 1997 and immediately began with interim measures .
i tried to get him time to speak in this debate but unfortunately it was not permitted .
the hon member mr mckenzie was one of those who started this , but he did not finish it off .
i want to say to hon members that if there is going to be political interference , the business people of cape town will withdraw .
the large number of hoax calls , however , is disturbing in that it further erodes the already depleted human resources of the saps .
i would like to ask the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation what the shortcomings and challenges are .
as hon members know , those tariffs vary from r60 upwards , depending on whether they are pensioners and the like .
we have tried to define the public interest as widely as possible , and certainly empowerment is part thereof .
( 2 ) what is the modus operandi with regard to the selling of moveable property in such schools ;
the panel has been put together , having taken cognisance of all the names sent in by hon members .
since there are objections , the motion will have to appear on the order paper for possible discussion at a later date .
on the procurement field , a preference system was introduced to assist previously disadvantaged persons in the awarding of provincial contracts .
madam chairperson , let me first congratulate the leader of the house on his birthday today .
regarding vote 3 and the issue of procurement , i share the hon member mr ismail 's grave concern .
if the allegations are not true , the hon member mr isaacs , being an honourable person , will withdraw them .
the refusal of the anc to consider our requests will as a result lead to the further impoverishment of our people .
it is not as if i did not use my best endeavours to get support from all political role-players .
i wish to convey my congratulations to the hon minister of finance and development planning and to dr stegmann and his entire management team .
it is tragic and shocking to see what is happening in our public service and in our neighbouring provinces regarding maladministration .
madam chairperson , the knowledge of officials is now being tested - and that is the difference between ordinary workshops and quality training .
however , today he heard the wrong voices , and i do not want him to leave parliament .
madam chairperson , i am pleased with two comments that the hon minister of finance and development planning made today .
the only hon member on that side of the house who is truly honest is the hon member mr fransman .
of course the hon member knows that there are ailments on both sides , but let me waste no more time .
madam chairperson , i want to react to the point the hon member mr gabru raised with regard to smaller businesses .
have hon members noticed that the hon leader of the opposition has been in the house regularly over the past few days ?
we must not adopt the attitude that it cannot work , and therefore we want to debate it .
] the hon member wants to debate it , as they say in another language , " abend und morgen " .
i do not care who the chairperson was , but i am giving hon members the facts of the matter .
] it should have happened before , but under no circumstances should it have been sitting with scof for that length of time .
i certainly do not believe that individually or collectively the anc - well , perhaps in this province - are thieves .
he , in my view , has done more harm to the process of issuing casino licences than any other person in this province .
for those hon members who are not sure about it , going to war is serious business .
his answer was to suggest some one-off steps like office staff reduction , lower absenteeism and less protection for vips .
strikes by court officials , frequent escapes from custody , increasing absenteeism and dereliction of duty are becoming commonplace in the criminal justice orbit .
already in the western cape 21 police stations do not supply a 24-hour service due to a shortage of manpower .
currently the absenteeism percentage for the western cape police service stands at 9 % , which is about half the national average .
firstly , without knowing the broader picture , one cannot plan ahead for the future .
therefore , the role and importance of community policing should never be underestimated in ensuring successful operations .
madam chairperson , money spent on social crime prevention is a sound investment in the future .
madam chairperson , i would like to refer to a few other coordinating forums that are currently being performed by the department .
this scenario has led to an increase in youth involved in gangsterism and other criminal activities .
we cannot simply look into a few people 's eyes and say , " that is your responsibility " .
therefore i want to say to the hon minister that i am very satisfied and that i take pleasure in supporting him .
the people of the cape are today speaking to the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation , and he stands accused .
let me proceed with the charge : the available resources are still not being utilised in terms of the needs and our available crime profile .
what is a total disgrace , however , is that 29 cpos have been deployed in sea point as against none in elsies river .
in ocean view there are only 2 cpos as against the 8 cpos in hout bay and the 18 cpos in claremont .
we have had " paradigm shifts " , " comprehensive policy frameworks " , " shared understandings " and even " integrated policy objectives " .
the business sector are very much behind the saps and it is something that needs to be mentioned in the house .
we are very pleased to commend comm max for his latest operation which has been very successful .
however , the successes of these programmes have either not been reported or there have been none .
the worst case of vandalism is undoubtedly the damage done at the magnolia primary school in paarl .
however , we know that the hon minister is too modest and honest a person to accept such an honour .
] he should not tell us that his office has been downgraded because he now speaks to a deputy minister .
] i hope i am going to get some extra time because of the hon premier 's rude interruption of our speeches .
if those hon members are satisfied with that , they are also satisfied with the thousands of people who are murdered every year .
we have also engaged in a major events strategy to attract top sporting events , both nationally and internationally .
the provincial government is faced with present priorities that must be addressed in health , welfare , education , safety and security .
their members expect them to deliver a professional service at all times and in difficult circumstances , and in their free time in particular .
mr chairperson , i also want to pay tribute to these volunteer officials - the chairpersons , secretaries , treasurers , umpires and coaches .
speaking of coaches , there is an umpire of international renown in our ranks , the hon member mr e isaacs .
i can name some of them : sir lowry 's pass primary school , gordon high school , danie ackermann primary school and kanulethu high school .
these include h nortj primary school , also in strand , strand primary school , strand high school and hottentots-holland high school .
we need to make sure that there is no difference between the facilities in green point and those in guguletu and manenberg .
i am pleased to see that the athlone stadium soccer project is up and running .
without sport and recreation youngsters will not develop healthy lifestyles and will engage in all kinds of antisocial activities .
i therefore call on this house to endorse the aims and vision of our sport and recreation arm .
madam chairperson , i want to link up with what the hon member mr e isaacs has just said about soccer .
i could not understand the complaint with regard to soccer that came from the hon member mr fransman .
the hon member mr lewis referred to transfer payments to ussasa and he is absolutely correct ; they need to be monitored .
most hon members have witnessed today the wide diversity of our cape flavour , for which we have become world-famous .
we want a full 100 % of our people to be satisfied with their quality of life in our province .
one of these tools is communications technology , which has been proven worldwide to result in a greater increase in economic growth .
we proved this with the city community patrol board and we will do the same with project chrysalis , which i will refer to again later .
the mere lack of driving skills and good judgment , and in particular unroadworthy vehicles , also made their negative contributions to the death toll .
we have a new speed limit for mini taxi 's , and it is necessary to keep to this limit .
if such a person wants it again , then the whole driving test must be done again after a period of community service .
we are the descendants of the people from asia and our more recent migrs from saharan africa .
we need not look far beyond our borders , at the anc 's ideological allies , former and present .
( 2 ) calls on the minister of community safety , sport and recreation to order an investigation into the incident ; and
i shall come back to the policy implications that i believe arise out of prof van den bergh 's analysis in a moment .
this means ensuring that all our pupils get approximately 200 days of full teaching and learning time each year .
mr chairperson , our fifth priority is to improve the infrastructure of our schools apart from burglar alarms and fences .
mr chairperson , we currently spend 90 % of our budget on salaries and 10 % on everything else .
madam chairperson , permit me to begin by congratulating the hon minister of education on her budget speech .
of all these education departments , the wced took the lead with the implementation of the recommendations that have been accepted .
secondly , the behavioural problems will be identified at ordinary schools at an early stage and remedial action will be taken without delay .
i cannot understand why the feeding schemes are to be terminated in the poorest parts of the community .
in paarl there is a residential area known as amstelhof - and that has nothing to do with amstel beer .
last night i heard once again that the feeding scheme of the school there is to be terminated with effect from 1 april 2000 .
another related factor is the quality and practicality of programmes when one deals with change .
i want to give one or two examples from the wced of what i think it should not be .
furthermore , i would like to commend them on the budget presented to scof and before us here today for debate .
education is crucial , because it is the most important and sustainable form of wealth redistribution available to any society .
in other words , the schools that have been advantaged over the years received the same funding as the disadvantaged schools .
just to touch on one of the topics he spoke about , he mentioned political will .
i want to congratulate the hon minister of education on being so passionate about education in the western cape .
i want to thank the hon minister of education for her sympathetic handling of the cases about which i have enquired .
i want us today to focus on one of the schools in the strand called khanyolwethu high school .
i also want to emphasise that the hon minister should develop the political will to assist in this regard .
in my last speech i expressed my support for the hon minister 's programme and plans for the department .
there are precedents in other countries of a flight from the public school sector towards independent schools , particularly from within the middle class .
i am not just visiting schools , but also looking at the socio-economic conditions in the area itself , and so forth .
i come to habiba , a 1999 matriculant who obtained six straight a 's at manenberg senior secondary school .
those of our teachers who put an enormous effort into getting on top of curriculum 2005 have had enormous benefits for their students .
as the hon member knows full well , not every initiative or policy from the national side is in support of transformation .
let me tell hon members that millions of parents and every taxpayer will support us in doing that too .
this expenditure goes hand in hand with other interventions which are aimed at improving the health status of the poorest communities .
in the course of the year checking-in systems will be extended to all outpatient departments and all health facilities in the metropolitan area .
the branch is in the process of finalising the contract with the candidate nominated for the post of business manager .
i firmly believe that this is necessary to provide adequate incentive to increase revenue generation at institutional level .
this will mean that the biggest multidisciplinary paediatric intensive care unit in the world will be opened at the red cross hospital this year .
in this budget we have set aside r3 million to pay for 58 new nursing posts for community health centres in the metropole .
there is also no indication of how , from a financial planning aspect , the hiv and tb programmes will cooperate .
special attention must be given to addressing the health needs of people with disabilities under all health policy areas and departments .
communicable diseases , both among adults and childhood populations , are one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in south africa .
in addition , integrated primary health care services in south africa include a nutritional component to identify and address nutrition-related disorders .
i want to touch on another epidemic in this province , and that is the whole question of trauma and trauma management .
we have supraregional hospitals that are under one directorate , with one set of standards , and metropolitan hospitals under a different set of standards .
] mr d silke : madam chairperson , it is a pleasure for me to enter this debate today .
in addition , the percentage of households with medical care less than 5 km away is also highest in the western cape .
i intend approaching the cabinet soon with a new provincial health facilities boards bill ...
the only method that we have for getting rid of staff is voluntary severance packages , other than deaths and retirements .
i am sure that of the r100 million a year spent on overtime , we could save r20 million .
his government pioneered the voluntary severance package system and he was signing off health workers like flies .
] regarding our programmes , the curative part is successful and i am very happy to announce that .
i am addressing hon members who had the courtesy to put questions to me in their speeches .
in my speech i said quite clearly that i am concerned about the management at our day hospitals and community health centres .
there is a major new emerging market that cannot afford medical aid funds , but would like better health .
i want to refer to the mitchells plain magisterial district , because i am sure that it is of concern to everyone .
it was also the idea that at the end of the three-year period the women would be the owners of the project .
within these multipurpose-centres they accommodate social welfare services , health services , recreational programmes , vocational and social skills training , economic activity and all other relevant programmes .
madam chairperson , it is a major challenge , but also a major privilege to be associated with this branch .
i do believe that he must feel extremely disappointed today if he has read the newspaper headlines over the past few days .
if hon members want to acquaint themselves with this , they can read chapter 2 of the aforementioned declaration on social development .
mr chairperson , i think that in recent times there has been enough fighting , enough shooting of pawns and enough venom .
mr chairperson , for me it has been an incredibly important period , being able to work with dr tom sutcliffe .
there needs to be monitoring to see how we can equip and educate parents to be able to look after these children .
at the end of the day , if we have good families and good individuals we are going to have good towns , good provinces and a wonderful nation .
although we are entrusted with a welfare budget in the western cape , we are in fact merely an administrative extension of national policy .
farm labourers should be empowered to become farmers and fishermen with paper quotas should become owners or shareholders in the fish-processing plants .
we all recognise that old-age homes are not the answer to our long-term problems of caring for the aged .
i especially mention it with specific reference to the 137 poverty alleviation projects that were initiated prior to my taking over this portfolio .
to begin with i want to respond to the commentary by the chairperson of the standing committee , the hon member dr van zyl .
i am pleased to be able to announce that the r62 between calitzdorp and ladismith has been opened to traffic .
although this announcement has brought relief in the short term , the implications of the reduced budgetary allocation will still be felt .
the department of housing has the privilege of managing the largest and longest-running presidential urban reconstruction project in the country .
an important element of this transfer , however , is that the flats may not be sold without my permission ...
a draft agreement has already been prepared in conjunction with the metropolitan councils , and has been circulated to them for their final comments .
the third session commenced on 6 march 2000 and is also being presented by the university of stellenbosch .
in addition , this year will see the inception of a capacity building programme aimed at all stakeholders within the housing delivery process , including the beneficiaries .
the beneficiaries will therefore have to start contributing to the erection costs of their houses , whether by savings plans or through microloans .
if this practice is allowed to continue unabated , the housing need of the towns in question will never be effectively addressed .
] for the past few years i have been appealing for a mechanism to assist these individuals .
madam chairperson , i would like to give feedback on an initiative that i mentioned in my budget speech last year .
the possibility of a hydroponics farm in the oostenberg area was researched and land suitable for such a project has already been identified .
we have enough problems as it is , and to make housing a political pawn would be nothing less than criminal .
] i am glad , and that hon member ought to be glad with me , that there is another solution .
i want to ask the hon minister to help those people to get resettled in district six , if possible .
it is estimated that in the non-metropolitan area close to 70 000 or 80 000 people are not adequately housed .
in 1997 the hon minister committed himself to a process of land identification of all state land in the metropolitan area .
with the increasing backlog and non-delivery - or delayed delivery in certain areas - this sector is growing out of all proportion .
i still want to know from the hon minister of housing what criteria are used in appointing these developers .
those inside can see right through , and when it is raining people have to move their beds and furniture because of the water leaking through .
madam chairperson , there are stubborn rumours doing the rounds that arrears debts in certain communities were written off at some stage .
it is something from which we cannot run away , and something that we will never be able to evade or sidestep .
that tells us that it will take us 10 years to eliminate the current housing backlog .
madam chairperson , i believe that the time has come for us to move away from the mere implementation of existing housing policy .
now , the question one asks is : why does oostenberg receive more than r80 million whilst the metro is underfunded ?
there is a myth according to which - i do not know where this misinformation comes from - cape town is not getting houses .
to date the management support programme has been instituted at 19 municipalities and it needs to be instituted at a further 38 municipalities .
the cmip allocation for low-income households in the rural areas has also been increased from r3 000 to an amount of r7 000 .
it seems to me that every time money has to be allocated , the fire brigade or the disaster management division is the last to get any money .
a work study investigation is already under way to expand my department 's capacity in respect of disaster management coordination .
the third important challenge is to protect the integrity of the future municipalities and to ensure a smooth kick-off .
in terms of section 12 of the local government : municipal structures act i must determine or specify the type of local authority .
there has been a process of consultation in this regard and we also gave our input to the national minister .
] in terms of the act i can do this , and i will do so in the interests of local government .
he says on the radio that a coalition with the new np is the last thing that he wants .
the hon member mr n m isaacs had a lot to say about the national government putting on the brakes , and so on .
the hon minister requested them , and the anc supported that request , that they should not spend money unduly .
] mr d silke : madam chairperson , it gives me great pleasure to enter this debate .
from a situation where any municipality could raise a loan , we now have ripped the creditworthiness of our local government .
the warning lights are flickering brightly that we cannot sustain the current inefficient means with which we offer service delivery .
my concern was focused on the treatment of the human resources in particular - the people who work at these municipalities .
this responsibility has now been drastically reduced from r24,976 million in the 1998-99 financial year to a mere r38 000 in the 2000-01 financial year .
they are going to vote again , but they are still poor and they are still without any hope for a better future .
it is strange to me that there is a limitation on the number of people that may take part in those forums .
many things have been said here today , and i want to speak to two issues : transformation and the reorganisation of local government .
i think the dissension in the new np is about the questions : can we not cooperate with the anc ?
madam chairperson , thank you very much for the opportunity to respond to a few points raised in the debate .
i wonder what the hon member mr mckenzie would have said if i had tabled the bill in the house .
i do not think there is a municipality in this cape metropolitan area that would act irresponsibly in this regard .
the next matter i want to discuss is the successful implementation of the western cape planning and development act .
in this regard , a task team was convened to assist the directorate : land development management in framing the regulations .
requests are received daily and the subdirectorate therefore plays a key and transversal role within the administration and outside it .
this it tends to do in terms of the western cape planning and development act , 1999 ( act 7 of 1999 ) .
madam chairperson , the dismantling of communities in rural and urban areas in the western cape must never happen again .
what worries me is the long time it has taken for the hon minister to reach this decision .
mr chairperson , with respect , because this case is sub judice , i cannot speak to the merits of it .
mr chairperson , dassenberg is important as a basis and a source of information for all people on the review board .
it is something that i wish i had learnt - perhaps he has gained wisdom through years of politics .
i also want to thank the hon minister of finance and development planning and his officials who are handling such a well-considered vote .
it appears to me as though those authorities do not support the way in which this transformation is taking place in the planning environment .
the hon minister of finance and development planning has spelt this out repeatedly , in the standing committee meetings and in the house as well .
because many times in this house , ministers have stood up and tried to contest statistics presented by the anc .
in the hon minister 's own department - now i am speaking specifically about planning - he has only 38 women .
there is one black deputy director , one assistant director , four white town and regional planners and two black , and so it goes on .
it is one of those over which we from the old management committee were very much at loggerheads during the apartheid years .
i want to respond to what the hon member mr louis said about keeping politics out of planning .
if the hon premier decides to combine certain functions under one ministry , i will abide by that decision .
i want to tell the hon member mr isaacs , if only i can find him here , that i had the view ...
madam chairperson , i would like to welcome members of ngos and cbos in the environmental and cultural sectors here today .
in fact , we have already identified two projects that will be tackled in the next few weeks .
a total of r2,2 million is allocated towards youth and youth-related projects , inclusive of the administration of these projects .
hon members may recently have heard of the exciting initiatives we are about to embark on in respect of the cape coons .
a committee has in fact already been established to focus on a carnival for cape town this coming december and january .
an amount of r13,991 million , which is 9 % up on this year 's allocation , has been set aside for museums .
these actions will be of value if people are made to realise that their actions promote a sustainable environment .
] the content of the programmes should be carefully defined and selected so as to make it as effective as possible .
in fact , if anything , the process of peer review already exists within the legislation .
i believe that culture and culture-related matters are a vehicle that can assist us in meeting this challenge .
additionally , it has regular contact with the provincial departments of health and social services on issues relating to hiv / aids .
] women should raise their voices to take back the streets , or choose to live in fear .
for many years the minority sector in our society has been privileged on all levels -education , health , jobs , arts and culture .
environmental education , or conservation education and training , is already an essential component of the national qualifications framework and forms part of curriculum 2005 .
therefore it is not surprising that macassar is struggling with tremendous pollution of the eerste river .
] they receive payment - listen to what i am saying - but they have no work to do .
for a few years now we have had the situation where the cultural budget was quite a substantial budget .
i also sent an official to the usa last year to attend a training course on this issue .
] madam chairperson , as a liberal democrat i must say that the individual 's human rights have to be respected .
] madam chairperson , on a point of order : you made a ruling earlier that interjections should be short .
i will continue in this ministry to encourage tolerance and the acknowledgement of the diversity of the western cape .
on page 6 , in line 21 , after " minister " to insert " , after consultation with the board , " .
mr speaker , i must say here and now that many of our people would not have had that debt today .
in an effort to counteract this unacceptable lawlessness , this year my department will privatise the operation of its weighbridges .
as far as the 2000-01 financial year is concerned , construction in regard to major projects , set out in the budgeting documents , will be undertaken .
madam chairperson , law enforcement has meant that accident rates during public holidays have clearly indicated better safety management in this province .
however , the most significant development is the decision to introduce a daily tariff system with effect from 1 april 2000 .
too much use is made of state vehicles for unnecessary journeys and we should like to counteract this waste of capital .
the latest figures show that we have about 10 500 buildings with an approximate floor area of 7 million square metres .
i did not know that mr spence was leaving next month , but i will be dealing with him a little later !
these investors have moved from france and england and located in cape town to put this plan in place .
let me tell the hon member mr mckenzie that seeing as we are receiving it , we might as well spend it !
we feel strongly about the fact that these advertising boards should not impinge on the sensitivity of the environment .
they wanted to know why toll-roads should be created and that toll-roads do not generate revenue in the province .
only once one has been in the department can one understand the complexity and the good work that they do .
i would appreciate it if that could be addressed and if mr leon fourie could report to me on it .
mr chairperson , lastly , i would like to say something about merlin about which i also spoke in the standing committee today .
the vision of the white paper and what is stipulated in the budget white book are not the same thing .
the eventual result was that we were able to award a black electrical contractor a contract of something like r1 million .
with the closure of this route , traffic congestion on entrance roads into cape town from the southern suburbs is at an unacceptable level .
sir , i wish to thank the hon minister of transport and works for the outstanding budget address he delivered this afternoon .
in brief , funds earmarked for roads should only be used for roads and not go to other departments .
hon members are aware that this is one of the four pilot projects announced by the national department of transport .
at this juncture - he should understand me fully when i say this - i do not wish to elaborate on that .
the hon member ms rossouw said that she was not satisfied with the funds allocated to transport .
notwithstanding this problem , we cannot curb the right of any hon member to move a motion .
( 2 ) condemns any attempts by the anc to politicise the positions of town clerks and municipal election officers ; and
south africa is lagging in this structural adjustment , and consequently our job creation potential is not what it could be .
because one can do it from an ordinary cellphone through advanced technology - one company destroyed , another company erected .
the department is currently engaged in finally rounding off the green paper , after which it must be approved by the cabinet .
such a registration system could also provide an affiliation mechanism for tourism-related enterprises which would benefit their profile and marketing ability .
this contrasts sharply with the minimalist tourism budget for the department as opposed to the board of the past .
the province believes that it is desirable for our future steps on liquor licensing to be managed within a sound intergovernmental framework .
madam chairperson , the property could of course be sold , or usage rights could be made available to the private sector for remuneration .
the department and the provincial statutory board , the western cape tourism board , has been doing this and continues to do so .
during the coming financial year the focus of this directorate will be to encourage collaborative actions in four key sectors .
the centre will be located at the cape chamber of commerce and it will have an independent management with a small staff complement .
of all the provinces they provided most of the backup to khula and the launch committee to make this happen .
] due to public interest in applications where objections had been received , the board held hearings ...
regarding the identification of sector growth opportunities , i really believe that we need to be proactive , and not reactive , regarding this .
there was the elsenburg one involving 135 hectares of land and then there were the 125 beds at tygerberg .
mr chairperson , i should like to link up with what the hon member who preceded me said here .
in brief , my appeal is for our own import replacement and export incentive programme to enable us to attract foreign entrepreneurs to the western cape with enthusiasm .
he has briefly referred to the opportunities of those institutions in the niche sector in agriculture , and the enormous threats .
i am not sure what the time is , because it seems that that clock is rather problematic today .
in fact , that monopoly lasts until 2002 and they then have the option to extend it for another year .
the hon member said , " hennie bester is responsible for stopping the change in the liquor industry in south africa .
the hon member pointed out the other day that we were suffering from a huge lack of capacity in our force .
] they should not think that i am going to keep quiet in the house when they come and play the race card ...
i shall refer later to the negative climatic conditions that agriculturists have been facing over the past year .
madam chairperson , six months ago i announced that the development of the doring river-olifants river irrigation scheme as a dream project for this province .
for the 2000-01 financial year r600 000 has been allocated for rural projects at slang river , white water , papkuilsfontein , elim , suurbraak , buffelskraal , haarlem en oudoop .
reducing the nicotine level of tobacco is not a question of closing a tap or turning a switch .
madam chairperson , in conclusion , the most important work we can ever do is the work we do today .
taxation of means of production such as pick-up trucks , tractors and trucks has doubled and the purchase prices are forcing the profit margin lower .
those south africans represent almost three quarters of the 50 % of the population in south africa who are classified as poor .
these are only three poultry industries , but one would be amazed to see how many thousands of people will be unemployed .
she remembers that her parents are still getting an old-age pension , but in spite of that they were still obliged to work .
" the farmers of south africa said they would help him ; they would like this process to be finalised .
madam chairperson , i now wish to thank the hon member ms versfeld for her concern about dumping in agriculture .
hon members will recall that we have already gone through the process of asking questions on each vote .
on that basis we would like to put on record our objection to that subprogramme , which deals with the amount of r4,004 million .
the debates have not dealt with those issues , and sometimes the ministers have not answered those questions specifically .
when we identify a particular programme under the vote , we can vote on that ; that is my understanding of the process .
most hon members have witnessed today the wide diversity of our cape flavour , for which we have become world-famous .
we want a full 100 % of our people to be satisfied with their quality of life in our province .
one of these tools is communications technology , which has been proven worldwide to result in a greater increase in economic growth .
we proved this with the city community patrol board and we will do the same with project chrysalis , which i will refer to again later .
the mere lack of driving skills and good judgment , and in particular unroadworthy vehicles , also made their negative contributions to the death toll .
we have a new speed limit for mini taxi 's , and it is necessary to keep to this limit .
if such a person wants it again , then the whole driving test must be done again after a period of community service .
we are the descendants of the people from asia and our more recent migrs from saharan africa .
we need not look far beyond our borders , at the anc 's ideological allies , former and present .
by way of this statutory amendment we must address the deliberate effort of certain agencies , to make the provision of transport facilities unfeasible .
the national land transport transitional bill has been passed and we are looking forward to its implementation at the end of this month .
mr speaker , why do i say that this matter is not related only to the codeta vs golden arrow conflict ?
this is about a principle - they are infringing on the passengers ' constitutional right to choose their mode of transport .
the tourism board of this province has spent taxpayers ' money given to them by this parliament to promote tourism .
in zimbabwe we are talking about the solution of a land problem , but no word from the dp about that .
however , today the people came to catch the buses at 05 : 00 and 06 : 00 , irrespective of the danger .
in the first instance it would have been necessary to find premises where the vehicles could be impounded .
if we are going to argue about this legislation on the basis of political affiliation , we shall not find a political solution .
as regards his reference to the laws of kwazulu-natal and gauteng , my colleagues there have expressed their support for me .
hon members should not leave here and then say outside , " just look what they are doing again " .
nevertheless the parents and family of amelia and bianca , and those of the others who died , have to understand this message .
to achieve peace on the cape flats it is indeed necessary to reconsider the redistribution of resources .
] they should be jailed for life or sentenced to death , but not paroled for their crimes .
mr speaker , the only real challenge to central government will have to come from municipal authorities in future .
by the end of his speech he referred to the redistribution of resources and that filtered through like a mantra .
we are speaking here about 50 people who , since the beginning of this year , have died in gang-related incidents in our province .
i would have taken out all those things and hurled them at the hon member mr byneveldt .
currently we are observing a different trend , namely that god-fearing rural communities are becoming the target of organised crime of gang activities and drug-dealing .
one also has to deduct 30 000 illiterate policemen or they must be put at half the figure .
it cannot be done if there are only one or two police officers driving past in a vehicle .
at many police stations policemen who are not properly trained as detectives are responsible for up to 100 dossiers per person .
secondly , the moment this is done - and in any event , we have too few competent members of the defence force at present ...
we should rather appoint 50 000 more members of the police , in the first instance to replace the 30 000 illiterate ones ...
however , the point is that the hon member mr byneveldt , in his speech , questioned the decision by the speaker .
t essop , j p gelderblom , n m isaacs , a ismail ( chairperson ) , m ozinsky , d silke , g r strachan
however , the situation is the same as that of the previous motion moved by the hon member mr silke .
the chair will therefore have time to scrutinise its contents in terms of the rules of the house and rule on it .
nevertheless we proceeded and supported the iec and the office of the president by making officials available everywhere .
we hear from the opposite benches that they are a model example , a multiparty coalition that demonstrates ...
they were very keen and willing to go and fight on the borders and in our townships in those days .
i repeat , they said that this was a call for democracy , and there were no facts .
mr speaker , the one thing that i should congratulate this coalition government on is that at least it was y2k compliant .
it was discussed at codesa and all the parties supported it , including the issue of bar-coded ids .
" the anti-corruption , clean government and accountability of the dp is now as hollow as it has always sounded .
there is no issue of public accountability here ; it must just be pushed through in a completely unaccountable , undemocratic manner .
] yes , but , mr speaker , " mr bean " only needed two hours to understand everything .
dr ncholo has clearly read the dictionary , because that is how he defined " volunteers " in his letter .
i am sure that with a little more work , energy and commitment on the part of the government ...
mr speaker , the hon member mr ozinsky stated certain things here - and i know why he stated them .
] that hon member said that they were going to the standing committee meeting , and i saw him there .
does the anc think that we made the decision on how to spend the money in a smoke-filled back room ?
] mr speaker , we made this decision based on what the acting chief executive officer of the iec ...
in the absence of volunteers coming forward , were we to say : " no , let us not proceed .
on this issue i need say no more , but i thank the hon member for prompting me .
in normal procedure , questions on unauthorised expenditure would have been raised via the standing committee on public accounts .
ministers will have to respond , and if they do not respond , politically this issue must be taken up at a different level .
madam chairperson , i would like to know whether the hon minister applied his mind to this when he approved the figures .
madam chairperson , i would then like to ask the hon minister of finance and development planning where the money was found ...
i want to ask him what his position is in this regard , that r20 650 from his department was used for this project .
madam chairperson , the hon minister of health and poverty relief said that r100 000 was definitely used for volunteers .
and we could have given bread to many people , but this country does not survive only on bread and soup kitchens .
we therefore have to have elections which are seen to be fair and just , and that is what we spent the money on .
some of the savings came from posts that had not been filled and some i got from natural attrition .
in the light of the fact that it came from natural attrition , i think we should agree with him .
the hon minister of social services and poverty relief informed us that the money came from savings in his department .
if i may answer that , madam chairperson , while that hon member and others were toyi-toyiing ...
madam chairperson , could we get an explanation from the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation about the r120 ?
madam chairperson , on a point of order : have you ruled that we are going to follow the same procedure in schedule 2 ?
was it r1 000 per civil servant , and for how many days did those four officials actually work for the r1 000 ?
obviously , if somebody only worked for one day , we did not expect him to get r1 000 .
the hon member should give us prior notice of the questions and i will answer what i can .
however , if the hon member wishes any questions to be answered , i shall be delighted to do so in writing to her .
whether they ask three questions that the hon ministers feel offended by is not something that i can do anything about .
there was an additional r159,06 in travelling costs , which might save some time in answering that follow-up question .
it was more that r0,5 million in this financial year that the hon minister of health managed to save .
could he indicate to the house from which programme and subprogramme he has managed to save r35 000 ?
i am sure that the adjustments appropriation will reflect savings in that department - but they took them from education .
madam chairperson , i am not prepared to answer that question .
all i can say is that the question is hypothetical and i do not think it is entirely possible ...
the hon minister of finance and development planning moved that the third reading of the bill should be taken now .
mr speaker , on a point of order : you have put the third reading and the house reacted to it .
it is remembered that this provincial parliament has always been concerned with the killings and attacks on the n2 ...
so , a spin doctor has mentioned the word " gangsterism " to show that it is on the agenda .
the anc is ready to rise to the challenges of transformation in the coming session of this parliament .
they also failed in a three-year campaign to brand the provincial government as racist and elitist .
mr speaker , i would like to deal with a couple of issues that the hon premier did not deal with .
it is the vision of the department of social services and poverty relief , where possible , to promote a self-sustainable society .
it asks devotion and endurance from the involved personnel and it will test the levels of skills of everyone involved .
the speech of the hon premier did not really touch on women , the youth , the aged and the disabled .
our people in those areas must experience the same kind of passion and action that has been seen along the n2 freeway .
the hon premier , the hon minister of community safety and the provincial commissioner of police must adjust their plan accordingly .
today the anc wants to address that challenge to the hon premier and through him to the hon minister of community safety .
mr speaker , i also wish to refer briefly to what the hon premier describes as " a municipal police presence " .
i want to thank the pawc and all public servants for the part they are playing in the successes of the province .
mr speaker , the da has failed the people of this province when it comes to housing delivery .
this is a real scandal , mr speaker , and i do not intend to let it go .
he said that he hoped that we would cooperate with the unicity , in particular with the mayor of cape town .
mr speaker , the hon premier mentioned his five key priorities for this year , and i congratulate him on these .
mention was made of gang violence , and in the southern cape we , too , suffer tremendously under the business dealings of these gangs .
when these men were arrested they had hard drugs , like cocaine , ecstasy and lsd in their possession .
the hon premier 's second priority dealt with economic growth and the fourth priority with development planning of the platteland .
mr speaker , thank you for the opportunity to speak in the debate on the opening address of the hon premier .
why is there no talk of our having to raise the quality of life of those who live alongside the n2 ?
mr speaker , the anc is so fond of talking about democracy , but they only understand it when they are in control .
physicians in the usa are thus being asked to delay the start of antiretroviral therapy in patients who are hiv-positive .
whilst the anc remains silent on the events in zimbabwe it can justifiably be concluded that they condone this lawlessness .
a few days later max du preez in his regular article in the cape argus expressed exactly the same sentiments .
my daily experience on farms in the western cape has been an absolute disillusionment to me as a member of the provincial parliament .
this objective will ensure that the essential infrastructure is developed to give the necessary stimulus and develop dynamic job creation programmes .
the hon premier 's vision for this year supports agriculture and rural development and the agricultural industry is very grateful for that .
she referred to the fact that one person earned r7 because he had only picked seven baskets .
if 90 % of these drugs are actually essential drugs - and cheap - what is the national government talking about ?
it is important that this remedy be provided free of charge under clinical study conditions and that the patients are also well guided .
why was he so quiet last year when the president of this country made devastating remarks about hiv , ...
the untimely debate on whether hiv is the cause of aids or not scuppered them to a great extent .
then one bosberaad follows another as to whether he should remain leader of the anc in the western cape .
therefore the polemic centres around that 5 % of the medicine on which the original developers of medicines still hold the patent rights .
these funds have been rolled over in a previous adjustment and some of these funds have not been allocated to any specific project .
the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism should give greater thought to a clearer enunciation of policy or frameworks for donations .
what little money has been spent in this department on poverty relief has been spent in a particularly unsustainable and a nondevelopmental way .
] hon members may have read about the robbery in johannesburg , i think yesterday , at the montecasino casino .
mr speaker , i would like to deal with two other matters that were raised by the hon member mr strachan .
the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism misled the house by saying that the casino paid .
madam chairperson , it was fair for the department of planning , governmental affairs and housing to comment .
the first part is in order , where the hon member moved the motion in connection with the lack of youth policy .
mr speaker , let us consider all the trouble that has been taken and the chronological sequence of events .
when we in the acdp look at the causes of the taxi violence , we believe that there are four critical issues .
the chairperson of the standing committee on economic development , the hon member mr louis has called for a new policy .
mr speaker , we say that this needs the sober addressing of the problems that affect public transport .
the udm also wishes to take this opportunity to convey its sympathy in respect of losses suffered by families .
why does the hon minister of transport and works not implement the programme that is on the table ?
myself to the provincial government , trying to mislead the public into thinking that provinces are in charge of policing .
is it the hon minister of transport and works , or is it the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation ?
that is an attempt at pouring oil on fire , and it is either profoundly stupid or profoundly clever .
one year ago the hon member mr ramatlakane sent a memorandum to the hon minister of transport and works .
how can the hon minister expect taxis to negotiate with respect when he is fundamentally unsure ?
] at every meeting they attend , they take new decisions , but we shall do what is expected of us .
the hon member mr lewis of the udm sent me a letter asking whether they could negotiate .
i will allow notices of motion before we deal with the notice of the motion printed on the order paper .
t essop j p gelderblom n m isaacs a ismail ( chairperson ) m ozinsky d silke g r strachan
in terms of that agreement each shareholder is entitled to appoint two directors and business cape six .
this was also the opinion of the auditor-general , who had to monitor the activities of the province and contributions to the company .
firstly , the appointment of a joint design team , consisting of the revel fox group and the footprint group , as they are known .
south africa has increased its market share of worldwide meetings from 2 % to 3 % and is the most prolific african destination .
for those hon members who think that that is far-fetched , the atlanta convention centre has its furthest booking for 2017 .
it is interesting to note that the three shareholders are the western cape government , the cmc and the city of cape town .
unfortunately for them , we had to turn down the motion because we thought that the bill should at all times be accorded priority .
it is not correct , it is almost deceitful , to claim that we should not deal with the shareholders ' agreement .
available gross space of approximately 10 000 m  will also be available for exhibitions , concerts and large gatherings .
the convention centre project links tourism and commerce and can be a catalyst that moves the western cape into the second phase .
it is within this phase that decisions will be made which can establish the western cape as a world-class destination .
at that point the province should have known that they would require enabling legislation to authorise the shareholding .
on 3 december 1999 the second shareholders ' agreement was signed , and still there was no legislation in the pipeline .
the house should be informed that there is no such thing as a " government of the western province " .
let me put the constitution aside , in case hon members are worried that the constitution is not applicable !
mr speaker , i wish to warn the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism about the suspensive clauses , the land issue .
in regard to guarantees , it is unfair to allege in the house that we did not deal with that .
he is a director , as far as i know - and he has disclosed it fully to the hon premier - of private companies .
some of them were stronger in design and others in project management , and we wanted a combination of those skills .
on who owns the land , the land is owned , according to legal opinion we have obtained , by the provincial government .
madam chairperson , on a point of order : is it possible that we could hear the amendment more clearly ?
it would have to comply with both subsection ( 1 ) and the new subsection ( 2 ) that we are inserting .
one always makes legislation on the basis of what can be foreseen at the time of the legislation .
for the purposes of the provincial government making a financial contribution to convenco in terms of the shareholders agreement ...
it is a substantial amendment ; it is not just a wording change , and that is my motivation for this amendment .
however , i think the hon member ms essop should move the amendment in the house now , if she would like to .
the rules committee , having considered the issue of the demarcation of the parliamentary precincts , resolved as follows :
all municipalities will have mayors , and i think that this is an important point that we are putting to hon members .
and then he goes on to say , " the doors are not closed ; we can have further discussions .
that person said that there was nothing wrong with what the anc was asking , and wanted them to accede .
the principle of cooperative government also applies to the relationship between local government and other levels of government .
accordingly , in the standing committee we moved an amendment that would have made an executive mayor system part of the options .
this was voted down , and once again the hon member mr n m isaacs misrepresented our position entirely here .
mr speaker , the new np regards local government as the level of authority which symbolises the future and dreams of communities .
the new np is unable to support the idea of a mayor with executive powers for the following important reasons .
the western cape determination of types of municipalities bill creates the opportunity to elevate non-contributing citizens into contributing citizens .
this is nothing other than centralising political power and simply ignoring any representivity of minority or opposition interests .
after the anc in the western cape province said that dan kotz should resign , he established his own civic organisation .
we are mindful of what the french philosopher , balzac , had to say about the judiciary , and i quote :
we all know that the predominant morality of the white community was that of innate racial superiority of whites over blacks .
it is just a pity that he did not inform the hon minister of education and others of his view .
we believe that balanced and rational public criticism is necessary to make the judiciary account for their actions .
there are innumerable examples that we could mention , but this morning we are specifically discussing the interference in the judiciary by anc politicians .
many people served long sentences which they did not deserve , and the judgment was based on the apartheid system .
one can imagine the mother of that baby after that judgment - what had happened to her hopes ?
he said that the anc was doing everything it could to support the judiciary .
there is no one who can bring any evidence to the house that the anc has interfered with a judgment .
mr speaker , when one looks at the order paper , it is a pity that the new np is reacting in this way .
frankly , these double standards and dual morality are something that we will continue to expose , mr speaker .
the new np said that they would reduce the number of dp cabinet seats , but the dp said , " just try it !
six years of democracy have shown and proved that the new np cannot ride both horses at the same time .
dr van zyl slabbert , in his book afrikaner afrikaan , speaks about a conversation he had with constand viljoen .
mr speaker , it is all right for them to make sure that white privilege is preserved in this province .
they fight against every single piece of transformative law that will bring my brothers and sisters into the central fold .
the motion was really senseless in the debate conducted here by the new np .
when i went outside earlier i saw a poster stating , " piet meyer in custody " .
in fact , they became so successful that they managed to enter joint ventures with bigger consortiums .
these people had struggled entirely on their own with their own personal money for five years , but became a success .
sir , small , medium and micro businesses can play a major role in solving some of south africa 's biggest problems .
presently this sector is a major source of employment and needs the full support of all three spheres of government .
the market needs to be attracted in order for economic growth to become a reality by measures such as i have suggested .
we have liaised with the portfolio committees on trade and industry in the national assembly and the national council of provinces .
mr speaker , finally i would like to say that we want the banks to do their work .
there are a couple of other problems , experienced by black businesses particularly , which hon members did not raise .
the eastern cape never even took the trouble to nominate an official to come to the formative meetings .
let me tell hon members that we do not have a white eurocentric person in charge of our tender board .
we have a black woman in charge of our tender board , if hon members really want to look into the eurocentric approach .
reports of the auditor-general on the financial statements of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1999 :
- a cost-benefit analysis showed that the purchasing of the specific copier would be more beneficial in the medium to longer term ;
local governments : management support programmes ( auditor-general 's reports [ pr 34 / 2000 and pr 24 / 2000 ] )
( iv ) adult basic education and training bill [ b42-2000 ] .
and therefore we ask whether we are correct in our predictions that the newly formed da is just not working .
madam speaker , having been in goodwood yourself , you know it very well and how we fought for this .
what did the people and the ratepayers of pinelands contribute to neighbouring townships , such as langa or even to garden village ?
one is 6 is estimated to be technically bankrupt , and only 1 in 4 can raise credit at commercial banks .
a 2 % tax on land could depress land prices by 12 % and net yields could fall similarly .
the draft property rates bill oversteps the mark by dictating the system of rating all local government councils must use .
of all the political parties only the anc made a submission in regard to our vision for the unicity .
what i have indeed heard is differences of opinion concerning the mechanism to be utilised and how the redistribution is to take place .
eventually we arrived at the 12th bill , if one could call it that , which was published for comment .
this year , the previous year and the year before that there were rates increases of up to 15 % in some areas .
i firstly wish to ask whether the hon minister of local government and development planning would accept a question .
madam speaker , before the interruption i was referring to the participation in the debate by the hon member mr mckenzie .
it is a great pity that we have to say to one another today that the whole debate on rates has taken a negative turn .
i want to ask the hon minister whether that is a case of brown and black lives as against white lives .
in this instance i allowed the request , given the mood in the house and the nature of the debate .
south africa needs its agriculture which , through expertise , forms an essential lifeline with the rest of the world .
what is the government doing in order to shift this devastating impact on the food producers in this country in a peaceful direction ?
( iv ) adult basic education and training bill [ b42-2000 ] .
mr w p doman ( chairperson ) ms l brown mr r j king mr l ramatlakane mr d silke
in my opinion it is irrefutable that the hon minister of social services was reacting to interjections by hon members .
mr speaker , next i wish to refer to the proposed amendment of schedule ii of law 4 of 1996 .
mr speaker , i have pleasure in introducing the western cape ninth gambling and racing amendment bill .
it is now more than three years since the western cape gambling and racing board and its staff were appointed .
the public who gamble at these gambling houses have no protection against the manipulation of payouts and other dishonest practices .
the subsequent limiting of the definition of " social gambling " will reduce the potential for abuse by criminal elements .
after numerous public hearings and other evidence had been considered by him , he submitted his report on 12 january 1999 .
there is no doubt in our minds that there are some serious problems in the new np-controlled south peninsula municipality .
hon members know who the building inspector is , but if they want his name i can give it to them .
on 2 august 2000 the anc released a very sleazy report , and i wish to quote from the press release at that time .
if we had had concrete , prima facie evidence we would have acted upon it , but at this stage we have none .
the fact that mayor jacobs , who is an honourable man , lived next door to me for 30 years is fine .
the hon member must ask for a proper investigation and then a finding can be made and the matter be dealt with .
of course , the hon minister does not see anything wrong with this , because it is business as usual for him .
however , we have a problem , because he is now a minister and he is accountable to the taxpayer out there .
we have raised only the interests of the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism , because we are holding him accountable .
the companies act is not the relevant legislation when it comes to the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism .
therefore , he has to abide by this legislation and the executive code of ethics , and they are both clear on this .
his board consists of a lot of - let me be the racist that i apparently am - white men .
more importantly , the executive members ' ethics act requires this , including for family trusts .
] i am proud , i am extremely proud that we have somebody there who understands projects like this .
mr speaker , last week the newspapers reported on some tape recordings by mr hayman , a dp member from tokai .
in this debate the dp has come out in defence of the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism .
mr speaker , if the opposition think that they are weakening my resolve i have some bad news for them .
i am not going to rule against the hon minister because i do not think he did it on purpose .
i will supply any information that he may require , and i would ask the anc to put up or shut up .
( iv ) abolition of lebowa mineral trust bill [ b49-2000 ] .
( viii ) home loan and mortgage disclosure bill [ b53-2000 ] .
it seems to me that the government is not prepared to sit down with pagad .
mr speaker , thank you very much for the privilege of participating in the debate on this exceptional occasion .
in blue downs he said many things about problems relating to the crime that takes place there .
hon members will recall that some time after that the bombs did not explode so regularly , and so on .
the defence goes on to argue that the birth of democracy was accompanied by terrible pain and struggle .
mr speaker , the onslaught on our democracy is becoming so severe that not even we as leaders escape .
within this context , then , it is inexplicable that the national government does no want to sit around a table with pagad .
one is that if the premier is vulnerable , all of us in the rest of the province are more vulnerable .
in rustenburg in the north west province two right-wingers were found guilty of bombing a mosque .
it is also a history that attests to tough action , great bravado and leading our people to freedom .
very few thinking people wish to associate themselves with the anc as it stumbles from policy blunder to policy blunder .
the performance of the national minister of health on television last night illustrates the result of this sorry state of affairs .
they said that they wanted an end to an ineffective presidency , because his deputy was running the country .
one after the other they got up at that conference and said , " dene smuts does not speak for me .
" and the devil replied , " man , i get the blame for everything , even though i do nothing .
( 3 ) deplores the fact that individuals may not freely express what they believe in ; and
- any expenditure in terms of section 25 ( 1 ) which relates to unbudgeted expenditure of an exceptional nature ; and
we need to ask ourselves what the problem is with calling on organised agriculture to do a very simple thing .
that hon member need not be worried , i have not yet identified him as a rotten apple .
however , madam speaker , what we are seeing in the western cape and what we are also becoming accustomed to is an utter disgrace .
on that same farm hendrik petersen , andrew petersen , john mentoor and hettie ruiters were paid between r35 and r70 a week .
however , in some areas where crime and violence may be considered stable farm violence is on the increase .
we have to bring a case , so to speak , because one christmas he evicted one of his managers .
he is a building contractor and he does not even live on a smallholding , but the hon member conveniently ignores that .
he spoke about a minimum wage for farm workers introduced by the anc - and i have the pamphlet here .
mr speaker , on a point of order : i would like to know the procedure in regard to motions .
( ii ) adult basic education and training bill [ b42b-2000 ] .
bills received from national parliament and tabled in terms of rule 208 : ( i ) adjustments appropriation bill [ b60-2000 ] .
( ii ) council for medical schemes levies bill [ b61-2000 ] .
reports of the auditor-general on the financial statements of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1999 :
an opinion on how deviations from collective agreements and resolutions by the bargaining council can be resolved must also be obtained .
a more cost effective and quicker service provided by the private sector should not be excluded as an option .
( v ) adult basic education and training bill [ b42d-2000 ] .
( xiii ) home loan and mortgage disclosure bill [ b53b-2000 ] .
half yearly report of the public service commission ( october 2000 ) .
mr speaker , on a point of order : is it permitted for another member to question the chair ?
mr speaker , i hope that with all the interjections you will be considerate to me as regards time .
it is very good that ministers have a good working relationship with their officials ; that is not in question .
they went further and embarrassed the tender board with another contract , which we will discuss later .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon member mr strachan whether he is aware that sadtu teachers ...
the new np and the dp did not allow proper process in the standing committee ; that was filibustering .
in the same period the anc votes dropped by only 4,2 % - 30 000 votes in absolute numbers .
mr speaker , as chairperson of the scof i inform the house that we support the western cape finance bill , 2000 .
on behalf of the standing committee i thank the hon ministers for their honesty and for the fact that they were available at all times .
i would submit that the results speak for themselves , although my cabinet colleagues will elaborate on this .
various votes have been allocated a portion of a total of r516 000 for the new pension fund for political office-bearers .
the premier 's vote has been allocated r3 million for administrative support for voter registration for the coming local government elections .
there is no gender policy , no programme on them and an endless roll-over of funds for those categories .
mr speaker , i am delighted to take part in the debate on the opening address of the hon premier .
mr speaker , the point i am trying to make is , what happens when the public lose confidence in their leaders ?
it is true that the da won the elections in the western cape , but not in the entire country .
the da may have won the battle in the western cape , but the anc won the war in the elections .
if they remember , it was first the rooi gevaar , then the swart gevaar and today it is the rates gevaar .
it will be our privilege as the anc to destroy and eliminate the da in the forthcoming elections .
] mr speaker , on the day when the tables are turned you and i will drink to it .
] patrick , you dropped the rev hendrickse like a hot potato , just as you are going to drop ebrahim rasool .
sir , i promised the hon member mr dugmore that i would answer him , and i do so with great pleasure .
it is a crying shame that , as at 31 december 2000 , r1,6 billion of housing funds had not been spent nationally !
yes , they do not have houses , because the hon member mr dugmore did not do his work properly ...
they hold conferences at citrusdal , they run around from left to right , but the end of the anc is in sight .
the motives of the masses are noble , but the leaders have led them down a cul-de-sac and put them on a road to nowhere .
the reality is that the da government of the western cape is spreading a mood of enthusiasm among the voters of the western cape .
we will instead recognise their own positive experiences and expressions by encouraging and promoting them .
i want to challenge the house to take , as a project , a visit to the squatter camps at barcelona and lusaka .
the reality is that at manenberg high school , in that big area where many children attend the school , there were 34 matric passes .
out of the 34 children who passed , not one of them has an exemption to go to university .
after that , we went around and met a few people , because it is the hon leader of the opposition 's constituency .
nowhere is the lack of delivery by the government of the hon premier more conspicuous than in the black african townships .
all those hon members see in front of them are criminals and they want to nail them and jail them .
i analysed what the hon minister of community safety and the hon minister of education said in the house .
i listened yesterday to the cruel response of the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works to the elsenburg problem .
die dice het verkeerd geval vir ons " , which is the issue that the hon member ms rossouw raised .
a further objective is to empower the poor of the province through the provision of basic services .
not one has stood up here and said that they , as members of the anc , are sorry for the necklace murders .
sir , let us look first at the results for ward 6 , the ward where the hon member mr mckenzie lives .
the ngos in the province have the confidence , the capacity and the integrity to reach thousands of people every day .
i must say immediately that i do not think a single party actually got absolutely everything it wanted .
( 3 ) further believing that racist prejudice lies at the heart of the campaign led by the da councillor ;
the hon member made a grave mistake when he tried to preach to me about cooperative governance .
i say , let the people of south africa and the western cape , as well as our international partners and investors , judge for themselves .
of course , in every province , in every part of south africa , there will be examples of racism - all kinds of racism .
mr dumisane makhaye from kwazulu-natal , a colleague of hon members on that side of the house , is a case in point .
he is a despicable man for saying so and the anc has done nothing at all to censure him .
mr speaker , in response to this the leader of the dp made the following comment , and i quote :
it is the responsibility of the school clinic to advise parents on where to place their children .
is there something fundamentally wrong with referring a jewish boy to a predominantly muslim school in the new south africa ?
who gives the hon minister the right to decide what muslims would and would not do ?
mr speaker , it is important for all teacher organisations in the country to know what the dp really thinks about education .
i am particularly interested to know what the muslim and jewish members of the new np think about this .
mr speaker , i would like to congratulate the hon premier on his opening address to parliament on 8 february 2000 .
decisions in education should rather be educationally justifiable and should not be imposed for the sake of a budget .
on the eve of the russian revolution the clergy were busy debating the length of their robes .
while they were busy debating the length of their robes the bolsheviks came in and took over .
did hon members know that water-bomber planes are used in italy and france during the summer season for fire-fighting .
that can and must be interpreted as a motion of no confidence in the hon premier by his own caucus .
all of a sudden the hon minister 's memory returned and he remembered that he did , in fact , have certain powers and competencies .
he was part of the government when dr death manufactured mandrax and scattered it across the cape flats .
i would like to refer to the hon premier 's invitation to the opposition to become constructively involved in governmental activities .
that is clear from remarks by the hon leader of the opposition which appeared in die burger .
i would also like to support the hon premier 's initiative to establish an electronic democracy in the western cape ...
the hon premier , in his opening address , emphasised the need for a realistic budget allocation between the social and economic sectors .
i trust that the predictions of wesgro will come to fruition and that they will not just be empty words .
already we are seeing significant new support from the community for the coalition government , based on our performance in just six months .
nowhere does the hon premier broadly make any mention of children , in particular children that find themselves in state-aided shelters .
it has become a national problem , but particularly in the western cape where the highest cases of rape and domestic violence occur .
when an hon member has finished speaking , then the fight has to end so that we can begin a new fight !
in the last fire , two weeks ago , 27 huts were destroyed and 79 adults and 40 children were left homeless .
thirdly , the research centre should have as its objective the unification of the hiv / aids prevention message across the province .
when a member intends to quote from a newspaper , a magazine or whatever , then it is acceptable .
mr speaker , it is a privilege for me today to congratulate the hon premier on his opening address .
" it was nowhere , but that is where the golden thread of racism could be seen running right through the anc .
not one hon member in this entire debate brought the name of courtney sampson into question .
] it is about the fact that we are giving them the money , but we are not going to do their job .
] surely the money has to be correctly utilised and there must be proper control over the use of the money .
] the hon member also assures me that that he has not even spoken to rev samson in this year .
we are still looking forward to the hon premier leading the western cape in creating jobs for the people .
until when are we going to be subjected to some corrupt senior police officials who do not have respect for the law ?
we are " wes-kapenaars " and we know that most of the claims that the hon premier has made are untrue .
another point the hon premier touched on was the racial divisions and colour-line politics in this province and country .
from may 1996 to today , some r2,3 billion has been invested in new hotels and other assets in the metropolitan area .
others such as the hon minister of finance and development planning simply used frivolity and silly jokes to defend themselves .
there is racism in this province - on the beaches , in the shops and even in the corridors of power .
if the new np realises that in terms of being effective in delivery to the people of the province ...
the hon member mr dugmore is not prepared to take a question and unfortunately his time has expired .
to me his opening address lacked anything to do with the real issues in the province .
we are six years down the line and the disabled still cannot enter ; they enter through the vip section .
] i was an hour early and i went down to the caf to buy a newspaper and fruit juice .
like the family of the child who is abused , the hon premier is saying , " let us not deal with that matter .
] the irony is that they are falsely accusing me of sectarianism so that they can whip up the muslim and jewish vote .
i do not intend spending any more time on the pathetic sectarian strategy of the anc .
if one belongs to the anc , according to their logic , one is automatically good and right , irrespective of one 's criminal record .
the principal of the recently built school told me , " we are serving the eastern cape in this school .
in the debate of 6 september 1999 she said , and i quote from hansard : western cape , vol 2 , p 129 :
mr speaker , some hon members have referred to the migration to the western cape and the implications that that has .
but i have been to guguletu , langa , nyanga , bonteheuwel and manenberg more times than i have had a hot breakfast .
i want to congratulate the hon premier sincerely on the message which he brought for the inhabitants of the western cape .
did any hon member in this house observe a demonstration , orchestrated by members of political opposition parties , before the parliamentary buildings ?
did any hon member observe any form of disrespect while the president was taking the national salute or listening to the national anthem ?
the target for the western cape is to test 25 % of the adult population within the next three years .
often relatively minor and inexpensive interventions can keep hiv-positive persons free from disease and , most importantly , reduce the high incidence of tuberculosis .
at times i feel that we bemoan crime almost as if it had become an unavoidable natural disaster , like drought or an earthquake .
we cannot allow unkept promises to become the management style of this new nation of ours .
madam speaker , i was going to devote most of my time today to issues of safety and security .
] after mr baadjies was released that night , he had to set out on a journey of approximately 20 km to get back home .
madam speaker , a responsibility rests on the shoulders of the government of the day to create legislation that promotes job creation .
i can assure hon members that the hon premier of the western cape would never , but never , have allowed this .
the hon minister in the office of the premier might be wearing a new dress , but she is still frieda adams .
i know , and those who were with me at bishop lavis know , the kinds of standards we experienced in our education .
i would like to draw the attention of the house to the importance of their calling for my resignation .
mr speaker , on a point of order : i think the hon minister of finance and development planning is misleading the house .
we have sought to facilitate the participation of smmes and formerly disadvantaged businesses and individuals through the new procurement policies .
an analysis of spending patterns show that they are slowly but surely aligning them with our policy priorities .
the province is thus evaluating the feasibility of generating new sources of own revenue in liaison with the national department of finance .
actual receipts in the 1998-99 financial year from motor license fees , as a percentage of own revenue , were in the vicinity of 48 % .
if this conditional grant is excluded from this budget , a nominal decrease of 12,4 % is reflected year on year .
i wish to remind hon members that a presentation on the budget will take place in the auditorium after the adjournment .
mr speaker , amidst all the havoc and chaos there is also a ray of light , sunshine through the clouds .
it also allows us to understand what we can expect at the end of the year as the key outputs of the government .
i would firstly like to raise the issue of the problems that existed about the voter registration programme of the provincial government .
mr speaker , even the members of her own party in the standing committee indicated their embarrassment on this issue .
four years after the national procurement policy preferential framework bill has been passed , the provincial government implements the bill .
if we consider our total budget of r11,288 billion , we are raising only r516 million , which is 4,6 % , which is absolutely unacceptable .
for the past six years in this province , the acdp has been studying possible ways of generating additional income .
the only thing that the national government can do is to regulate the way that those levies are imposed .
the departments have gone through remarkable change and improvement , except for the few hiccups that we experienced here and there .
it is clear that the hon premier 's leadership in the cabinet has had an effect on all the departments .
it is being said , with regard to job creation in the western cape , that the construction companies involved are mostly gauteng-based .
one such example is that while we were rationalising the academic health centres , we were at the same time expanding the primary health care base .
i believe that the individual ministers , in the committee stage , will be able to reply to the individual matters that have been raised in the scof report .
questions were answered and those people received all the information that this house , scof and hon members have received .
however , the good thing today is that i have two bites at the cherry - one now and one later .
madam chairperson , that is why the premier 's budget seems to have grown somewhat compared with last year .
my department includes the corporate services component of which the personnel function has been delegated to the hon minister of transport and works .
madam chairperson , regarding transformation , i am on record as saying that i want to see greater representivity in the western cape administration .
madam chairperson , this being a budget debate , i would also like to refer to the national minister of finance 's budget speech .
now the government wants to appoint people on its panel of aids experts who believe azt is really the cause of aids .
i would now like to get back to the matter concerning the higher standards and poor rating which south africa has just been given .
we are going to need a notch or two on some of the big guns holding up our true potential .
i agree with the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism that poverty is far more than a bread-and-butter issue .
the desks in my office will also take part in specific awareness projects in partnership with other departments and external role-players .
as far as the staff management function is concerned , the cabinet has decided that the aspects relating to coordination , human resource strategies and research should remain centralised .
the cabinet has launched the transformation 2000 project , which will take shape within corporate services within this financial year .
labour relations supplies inter alia a bureau service to the relevant departments which do not have sufficient skills in this regard .
as such they make a major contribution towards giving practical effect to the dreams and endeavours of this province .
a conditional grant of r1,5 million has been provided for the coming financial year to fund various initiatives in this regard .
i would further recommend stronger partnerships , communication and interaction with ngos who advance gender issues , specifically issues affecting women .
madam chairperson , i want to start by congratulating the hon minister of finance and development planning on his 2000-01 budget .
i also want to congratulate and thank the hon minister 's officials , dr stegmann and his team , for the excellent scof budget session .
future plans are for a provincial aids council to be put in place to liaise with the national council .
] i am not sure whether there is a plan in place , although she has claimed that there is a plan .
as we heard today , the acdp gave notice of a motion for the benefits of this type of regional agreement .
we would also like to congratulate those involved on the provision in this vote of r2,5 million for voter registration .
we believe that this spending is critical , provided that the process is transparent , structured and ordered as reported .
it is true that the rights of the disabled , the empowerment of women , and youth affairs are certainly being accorded cinderella treatment in the province .
it would also be very nice if she could provide hon members of the house with a copy of this business plan .
these entrepreneurial skills should be broadened to include skills used in public life and stewardship .
i do not know why the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation goes for me every time i speak .
that government is the first coalition in europe since the terrible holocaust where there has been even a whiff of neo-nazism .
none , not one , but i must tell her that in 1998 the western cape provincial administration adopted rod .
in this regard i want to refer him to what we mentioned this morning during the meeting , and to the scof meeting .
it is wonderful to hear the hon leader of the opposition say here today that they support the budget .
] there are many people out there who do not know what this province is doing and how well we are performing .
] it is my duty as the premier of this province to empower people to get their identity documents .
not to worry , we are going to do it irrespective of what those hon members say , because all of a sudden they are running scared .
if he waits , hansard will even translate it and then he will read in afrikaans what i have to say .
there was a positiveness about the comments on that side which i have not seen before .
but she continued to say that she had indicated to the standing committee that there was a business plan .
portfolio committee amendments to division of revenue bill [ b 8a-2000 ] .
the contribution of the law officer in aiding the speaker and his administration regarding legal and labour matters has been of incalculable value .
i am grateful to be able to report that a new breeze has been perceptible since they met my officials recently .
if discipline through party caucuses does not have the required result , sterner measures such as penalties may be the only alternative .
madam chairperson , this is also a good time to page back a little and take stock .
the patience of job and the wisdom of solomon on both sides will not make our problems disappear in this regard .
a vacuum exists in the marketing capabilities of the provincial parliament and we need to fulfil our duty in that regard .
has this limitation been imposed to clip the wings of certain chairpersons ?
madam chairperson , i have dealt with one constraint on the effective exercise of the constitutional obligations of committees .
one of the interesting things is that the salaries of mpps are paid as a direct charge against the revenue fund .
the hon member mr ramatlakane also asked that the declaration of financial interests should be included in our code of conduct .
to this end , we budgeted for r1,1 million for secretarial allowance , to be divided among the parties .
however , i will consider the staff positions that hon members create and how the money is used during this year .
i want to point out to him that rule 85 ( 3 ) actually refers only to the administrative matters of committees .
firstly , mr dick parris , the director : national operations of sa national parks , says very clearly , and i quote :
south african national parks staff ( ie mr joubert ) were present at western cape nature conservation 's request .
the hon premier should be looking at what steps he is going to take against ministers who misuse the government to the people campaign .
the temporary employees from the national department of home affairs earn r15 per hour , and the coordinators r30 per hour .
mr speaker , four photographs will be taken , two of which will be going to the office of the director-general .
the hon member mr mckenzie also alleged that we were now about to take over the work of the iec .
mr speaker , if this is solicitation to assist me , i would be delighted to accept it .
there is good cooperation between the department and a non-governmental organisation , being the western cape community-based paralegal association ( wesccopa ) .
( 1 ) the globular costs would take several months to quantify , given that -
( 1 ) what are the terms of reference of the provincial commission of inquiry into the cape peninsula fires ;
paragraph ( 3 ) r105 million per year ( temporarily on contract ) r36 million per year ( substitutes )
yes , but only for the financial years 1997-98 and 1998-99 as the board was only established on 9 april 1996 .
the hon minister has on his desk in front of him the tabled annual report for the period 1998-99 .
mr speaker , another piece of factual information is that the 1998-99 annual report was not submitted on 27 october 1999 .
it is not simply a matter of taking a document of this size and dealing with it in a rubber stamp situation .
if we as an opposition did not maintain oversight on this procedure , we would never have seen it .
mr speaker , i have noted the point raised regarding the period 9 april 1996 ...
we hope to submit it to the cabinet shortly for approval in principle and then to take it through the process .
my department has made the excuse that they lack the capacity to police the conditions of approval .
all applications , of which the recommended subsidy exceeded r25 000 , were submitted to the minister for consideration and approval .
cheques issued by the western cape cultural commission are co-signed in accordance with the decision of the western cape cultural commission .
senior staff members of the directorate : culture and heritage have been authorised by the western cape cultural commission to co-sign cheques .
mr speaker , may i request that this be tabled , as it is very difficult to follow .
my appearance in my official capacity at the meeting in question on 28 march 2000 was requested by a public representative .
this will also form the basis of further feedback to scof as i undertook earlier in the house .
if one looks at the actual dates , the hon member is correct about the gap that he mentioned .
( 1 ) according to statistics about 25 to 30 pedestrian-related accidents per year have occurred of which 15 are fatal .
transport was tasked with the keeping of accident statistics for the province as of 1 october 1999 .
on 6 june 2000 the interdict was set aside and each party ordered to pay their own costs .
a black person walks into the guguletu police station and loses his eye and the hon minister says absolutely nothing .
if the hon member would like me to read it , he should indicate this to me by way of a nod .
( 2 ) whether the submission was discussed by the standing committee on economic development ; if not , why not ; and
] that is pure speculation and i do not think that the house should allow that type of question .
mr speaker , again it is irrelevant , because a question like that is not meant for the house .
] the national minister has the powers that the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation does not have .
my appeal is : let us once and for all not politicise policing and the safety of our people .
] that is what the western cape government will stand against and not allow it to happen .
it has a population of 88 million as against the 4,5 million of the western cape , but their unemployment rate is 3,1 % .
there are photographs showing his open wounds and the awful conditions he lived in .
various white papers , legal requirements and collective agreements between the state and employee organisations give direction to the transformation process and long-term reform by the state .
on the initiative of the hon premier , there were also discussions over a long period with the top management of the pawc .
furthermore , mr speaker , in all the departments of the national government , most of those managers manage 105 officials .
as far as costs are concerned , it is estimated that an additional r16 million will be required for the senior posts alone .
the fear of true transformation is what drives this agenda and it is , with all due respect , a window-dressing exercise .
to answer the question about the bkv , i do not know since when she has been serving on the bkv .
addressing the violence in the public transport sector in the cape metropole enjoys the government 's highest priority .
whilst the security actions continue , a number of steps are being taken to resolve the economic and commercial issues involved .
i want to convey my gratitude to the former minister of community safety and the hon minister of transport , sport and recreation .
it transpired on 15 august that they had not checked that the president had signed the legislation .
mr speaker , it is a pity that the hon minister of community safety did not lift the veil a little .
to commissioner lennit max and his top management i extend my deep gratitude for the professional relationship we have enjoyed .
are the schools in lambert bay 's going to be amalgamated from 1 january 2001 , as requested by the disadvantaged community in lamberts bay ?
mr speaker , i am not aware of the millions of rand that the hon member mr ozinsky talks about .
the mec told the house in march that the value of the projects that were then outstanding ...
social economic contribution / commitments to education and training , health and welfare , housing infrastructure , land reform and rural water , crime prevention and affirmative action .
mr speaker , i venture to suggest that the questioner said , " if it is found " .
i am willing to find out , but i do not want it to be taken out of context .
( a ) the brief has been received , approval of drawings to take place in september and october 2000 .
you investigate the first national bank - the sandf or any other special unit involved in this regard ...
it is apparent that the hon member mr stali is out of his depth when he asks a question like that .
i regret that only the member who put the original question is allowed to put a follow-up question .
is the hon minister able to make sure that the money , the payment that has been made , is being put to good use ?
whether a preference procurement policy has been developed ; if not , why not ; if so , whether he could provide the details of the policy ?
the latter requires that amounts be prescribed for which a maximum of 10 or 20 points may be allocated for specific goals .
] it has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that the national government has not yet promulgated regulations .
as i have no knowledge of the matter , the hon member should put the question to me in writing .
could the hon minister indicate whether the question should be repeated , or whether it should be put in writing ?
( a ) remuneration is generally regarded as poor for someone who has studied for 5 years .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon minister of health what the ratio of patients to pharmacies is .
( 2 ) whether certain patients who visited the hospital during this period were turned away ; if so , how many patients ;
( 3 ) whenever possible , pharmacists are brought in from other facilities to the guguletu community health centre to staff the pharmacy .
the western cape directorate of sport and recreation , however , contributes financially towards the budgets of major events in the province .
( a ) the city council obtained a legal opinion and it was decided to take no disciplinary steps .
( 3 ) provincial developments for disability as it relates to the key focus areas of the desk are the following :
promotional materials for commemorative days have been developed and continue to be developed for this year 's international day of disabled persons celebrations .
if that is the question , the answer that the hon member is looking for would then be that i would certainly condemn it .
( 1 ) how many prisoners in the province have been released in terms of the recent release by the department of correctional services ;
has the hon minister made specific provision to cut the maintenance and repair backlog of r250 million ?
all vault facilities at examination centres were evaluated in advance by circuit managers to ensure that they comply with the required safety requirements .
the incident occurred yesterday at a school in khayelitsha when the english second language paper i was to be written .
the tender has been advertised , tenders evaluated but not yet awarded by the cmc .
( 2 ) educators are and will be responsible for the implementation of hiv / aids life skills education within the curriculum .
( 4 ) all schools have been provided with information on universally accepted precautions as well as additional information on how to take precautions .
secondly , the hon member mr dugmore will have to withdraw the words , " the hon premier is deliberately misleading the house .
i believe it was the hon leader of the opposition and his " cahoots " in the anc ...
i would like to say to the hon leader of the opposition that he should cast his mind back and examine his conscience .
i do not think that the incident at mcdonald 's had a major impact on investment in the western cape .
there are social grants and these must be awarded and one must look at the poorest of the poor .
the province spent in the region of r5 million , and i believe the cmc spent about r6 million .
the community patrol officer programme , in which this government is a partner , has brought down the levels of crime significantly in areas right across the city of cape town .
secondly , we are developing a comprehensive strategy to curb the gang violence that plagues parts of the province .
the province have selected the guguletu day hospital and paarl hospital as the two sites where we will dispense nevirapine .
regarding vote 8 - planning , local government and housing , the question remains : how much progress has been made in the delivery of housing ?
there were no public hearings on this matter , but scof must constantly agree to rolling over these funds .
there are other problems , too , in relation to the roll-over of funds for olympic projects and one or two others .
however , it should be taken into consideration that in this particular budget year we are talking about a total of r135 million .
more specifically , this allocation was made to enable the province to meet increasing spending pressures ;
the provincial cabinet adopted an incentive policy , with certain conditions , for departments to retain revenue collections above budget target .
when it comes to managing diversity , let me give the hon leader of the opposition a tip .
we on this side of the house will not allow them to burn this province with their scorched earth policies .
i want to assure those hon members that this coalition government , contrary to what they say , will deliver to the poor .
i was referring to the hon minister of housing , and i was asking how much money he had in his pocket .
this not a circus , but let me tell them that clowns are among the spectators .
] if they want to buy any more of our members , they should do it in full view of the public .
i made a public statement with the hon leader of the opposition and i have kept that promise .
the invitation to the anc is still open ; the door has not been closed should they want to work with us .
the long-term plan is to upgrade the zandvliet sewage treatment works so that it can handle an additional capacity of 35 megalitres a day .
mr speaker , i have one more concern in that specific area , namely the pump station at macassar and the electricity supply .
we are talking about a 40-megalitre capacity which sometimes goes up to 55 megalitres or even 60 megalitres a day .
( 3 ) we have requested this information from the department of community safety and we hope to receive it .
i would like to ask the hon premier if he would accept such an integration of the cpos into the saps .
for instance , a court case - which has since been settled out of court - resulted between the developers and the council .
( 1 ) how many police officers have resigned from the saps in the province for the period january to december 1999 ;
earlier he said they are not paying market-related rentals and now he is saying that they are paying market-related rentals .
mr speaker , i cannot answer the last question put by the hon member mr strachan .
it is a fairly wide definition which the hon member would be quite able to live with and support .
the department is , however , committed to addressing problem cases accordingly , as was clearly demonstrated in the klein river case at hermanus .
i did not receive a report from the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation at the meeting this morning .
( 2 ) expresses its thanks to the saps , sandf and all traffic departments that took part in this joint operation ; and
the previous concentrated emphasis on bringing the province within budget was continued into the 1999-2000 financial year .
during september 1999 the national department of finance introduced the new government finance statistics ( gfs ) budget formats to provinces .
the rainbow nation is standing on the brink , gazing into the abyss , wondering if it is going to sink or swim .
madam chairperson , i would like to give some background on the provincial service commission for our new hon members here .
it then went into limbo because of a court case against the then national minister for the public service and administration regarding the public service amendment act .
the dp on this side of the house will support any legislation that aims to alleviate this problem .
the hon minister told us about the policy for small and medium enterprises that would be tabled in cabinet in due course .
what was the role of the hon minister of finance and development planning in ensuring that this policy received urgent attention ?
we in the western cape are rightly proud of the fact that focused financial training at management , middle and lower levels takes place here on an ongoing basis .
i saw a document , which is already in circulation , with regard to what the hon member pointed out .
if hon members go to the goodwood site right now , they will not find one coloured steel fixer .
the hon minister of finance and development planning is following the right course in being prepared to introduce legislation .
how many hon anc members sit in the house for just a few minutes - can the hon member mr byneveldt confirm this ?
i would like him in future to be my speech-writer , because i thoroughly enjoyed his speech .
we will not get our own revenue by starting to dig for gold or diamonds in the middle of adderley street .
madam chairperson , i believe that it is necessary for us to keep on looking at the matter .
i will not keep on repeating what was said by other speakers who have spoken positively in that regard .
however , that bill is not complete without the regulations - and i am repeating what i said to the committee .
tender board - i thank the hon leader of the opposition for that - had gone against the department 's recommendation .
i also want to give an undertaking that i will see that a presentation to scof is made in so far as his is concerned .
madam chairperson , i have not got anything left on my notes other than to thank the house for its support , in the main .
those hon members who are struggling to listen to what i have to say have copies of my budget speech in front of them .
it is necessary to determine whether the three spheres of government are complementing and supporting one another in the common fight against the evil of crime .
the answer is that one cannot heal a sick person by recirculating his own diseased blood .
the remaining 8 543 members are all to a lesser or greater extent , depending on the management echelon , involved in classical policing duties .
successful social crime prevention will lead to less criminal activity with eventual savings in the entire criminal justice system , as well as other support capacities .
it clearly had a positive effect with officers being appointed to address the truancy problems in schools .
he should consider when the time will come that all law enforcement agencies in the province will operate under one command .
madam chairperson , to continue with specifics , neighbourhood watches have an extremely critical role to play in the combating of crime .
the anc asks that the hon minister consider better support for neighbourhood watches , specifically in respect of equipment ...
and then it is said that this deployment is being done in accordance with due and sound consideration of the crime profile in our province .
in addition , madam chairperson , the department of community safety is not proactive enough in regard to the launching of projects .
therefore , madam chairperson , can we really be surprised when it is our broader criminal justice system that fails us ?
this can only be ensured by consistently addressing the undermanning of the police service at the central level .
in this regard i should like to refer to the good results achieved by police forums and neighbourhood watches in the little karoo .
the police forum at oudtshoorn is doing valuable work when it comes to support of the police service and i am very proud of that .
i wish to express my thanks for the hardworking policemen in my constituency in the little karoo under the leadership of ass comm kosie japhta .
it is a pity that the hon minister did not mention the good work that business against crime is doing .
i would like to know what programmes they are handling together with other departments to deal with the abuse of the elderly .
indeed , it is his initiative and his baby and it can quite correctly be referred to as " mark 's chrysalis " .
after our discussion i saw another mark wiley - a person with a sincere compassion for the community that ...
after the community police officers have done their work on our streets , they still have to go and do an eight-hour shift as reservists .
nowhere do they actually talk about the central government who is meant to be doing the policing in the first place .
the fact remains that the truancy officials were among the first who got left behind when the education budget was cut .
i believe that there is still confusion at the moment about whose responsibility school sport is , as the hon minister has said now .
we want to know where these are and when they are being opened , as they can really assist our sports players at grassroots level .
the costumes were sewn by the teachers and parents and the community raised the money for their travel arrangements and expenses .
i should like to consider three aspects , namely school sport , sport tourism and the issue of internal auditing in the department .
we must not become a chair sport nation ; we must become involved , so perhaps she will be taking part in one of those sports .
the cabinet of this province has endorsed the soccer bid , and i call on the house to do the same .
however , i believe that education can do much more and that they should make a commitment to prioritise this learning area .
why should the people in guguletu and soweto run around in the streets and be pleased when the springbok rugby team does well ?
i think we give r100 000 to the disabled ; i am speaking under correction but i think our annual contribution is r100 000 .
i think only 10 % or 15 % goes toward administration and the rest goes towards the very general sport .
" i believe we can communicate more efficiently to let the people know what we are achieving .
the bavarian car manufacturer , audi , is to sponsor young artistes from the western cape to perform in bavaria during the european summer .
the western cape is the only region in africa , and one of only two regions outside europe , to be given this status .
alternatively , he should give the western cape its own full provincial policing powers and the budget to go with it .
the " old coffins on four wheels " to which president mbeki also referred on friday must be taken off our roads .
america 's world watch says the state of nature throughout the world is not at all good .
being obsessed with centralising power is not the example someone like laurent kabila wants to learn from .
promotion of equality and prevention of unfair discrimination bill [ b 57b-99 ] .
this is clearly not possible in the opposition benches ; they are not even prepared to listen to the point .
putting any more money into it would be , in the words of prof bengu , " putting money into a money shredder " .
we strongly support the drive to greater equity , but we must also ensure that this has an impact on educational quality .
mr chairperson , our second success factor is benchmarking to measure trends in quality at schools .
this is of considerable concern , as it is through this learning area that we can place the necessary emphasis on hiv / aids education .
the safe schools project was initiated in february 1999 , almost exactly a year ago , and it has achieved some remarkable successes .
the schools agreed to the changing strategy and it freed up r11 million to initiate the safe schools programme .
mr chairperson , 83 schools in the most violent prone areas entered into this agreement with the wced .
in the coming financial year the figure will be of the order of r15 million , and may have to be supplemented .
this is part of our policy of rewarding achievement and encouraging excellence in our schools across the system .
" khanya " is a xhosa name which means " to brighten , or to enlighten or to lead the way " .
i have sought to act upon them and this is precisely how things should work in a functional multiparty democracy .
for this purpose an infrastructure has already been established at school clinics to train teachers in the handling of behavioural problems .
the new youth care centres will be provided with professional staff and they will undergo specialised training in the course of the year .
i want to make an earnest appeal to the wced to ensure that a healthy body still houses a healthy mind .
according to the national norms and standards for the funding of schools , the feeding scheme is apparently to be terminated at certain schools only .
in south africa , with its horrible legacy of apartheid and the monumental inequality that continues to exist , this perspective must be very appealing .
given the non-linear and chaotic nature of change , if change is to be effective , it must be properly managed .
above all , one cannot alienate teachers , as the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation tried to do the other day .
in the case of the tembalitsha primary school , a new school to the value of r2,7 million has been budgeted for this year .
much of this national legislation has been good , and with much legislation we have experienced deficiencies as we have implemented it .
we have to recognise that the wced is the department that has been best able to implement national legislation and implement it in an orderly fashion .
covey 's book , the seven habits of highly successful people states , " we must all begin with the end in mind .
what we must do is heed the saying that goes : " do not do the things right .
" when the acdp looks at this whole matter , we see a couple of things that we would like to give priority .
however , we do believe that discipline needs to be enhanced , and i see that the hon minister has been playing a strong role in that .
it is reassuring that it has been shown that the hon minister is attending to this matter within the confines of a limited budget .
i want to know from the hon minister why there has been no initiative to change the conditions in this school .
i propose that the hon minister should act on this matter and report to this house in the next two months .
the south african schools act , 1996 ( act 84 of 1996 ) , dramatically changed the management and governance of our schools .
i had felt that it was totally unfair to use the condition of a building as a criterion for a feeding scheme .
hence , i presume , the myth emerged that we do not need textbooks to run curriculum 2005 .
- " v " stands for " visible improvement in prevention and control measures for hiv / aids and tb " ;
the " i " in " service " stands for " improving ( the ) public perception " of our hospitals .
amounts of more than r1 million have been allocated just to bring about visual changes , and this will affect 11 hospitals .
for the first time in five years , the health sector is stabilising , with prospects of improvement ahead .
we are still oscillating profusely , owing to the transition from one stable condition to another .
in belgium , i managed clinical trials in which the doctor 's remuneration was the equivalent of seven figures in rands per patient .
the hon minister of health touched on three very sensitive pressure points , especially the whole matter of the perception of hospitals .
some of the case studies over the past few years under the guidance of dr sutcliffe have been extremely successful , such as the pinelands linen outsourcing experience .
the site c hospital is always overflowing with people , and it does not have the staff to treat them .
although the employment equity act makes provision for this , it is difficult for the management structures to implement the act .
his death made no headlines and there was no cape at six , punt radio , television cameras or commission of inquiry .
we were too busy focusing on and preparing for the next election to hear his pleas .
we are further reducing health personnel in spite of projections which indicate that our infant mortality rates are likely to worsen because of hiv / aids .
the hon leader of the opposition quoted from my 100-days speech regarding what i would do about hiv / aids .
the provincial aids council will now be instituted , because it is national policy and the interministerial council has been taken over at national level .
as far as the contribution by the hon member mr marais is concerned , i want to congratulate him on his first speech in his new capacity .
a consultant was appointed - the ngo streets - and they had a pilot project for six months in the western cape .
regarding secure-care facilities for children who have committed serious crimes , we are now establishing two such facilities .
i must just mention that at all shelters women and their children are accommodated , not just the women .
in this budget there is only an amount of r500 000 available and that can only help us with the planning process .
hopefully , with the eerste river , guguletu and caledon district offices coming into operation , it will help to alleviate this problem .
when it comes to fraud and corruption , there is a specific inspectorate within the social services department that deals with that .
i would like to conclude by congratulating this branch for really building partnerships with the community and ngos .
these were the words of the former president of the country , mr nelson mandela , at his inauguration speech on 29 may 1994 .
the process of involving more ngos has been rather slow , as service delivery at ngo level is service-field orientated .
the development of affordable community-based care and support models is an important mechanism by which networking and service rendering are underpinned .
mr chairperson , the launch of the women 's partnership against aids campaign took place on 8 march last year , on international women 's day .
the department played a significant role in the success of the launch , which was attended by 5 000 people .
the social services department i am sure provides the best shelters , orphanages , crches and places of safety for children .
the integrated development approach that the department strives for can strengthen and build the lives of children and also lead to cost-effective service delivery .
as for the acdp , i can truly say that we have always been passionate about the plight of women and children .
that is also why i am so pleased about the hon minister 's announcement today about the service level agreements , which are performance-orientated .
we should take this portfolio away from the hon minister in the office of the premier , if we are serious about poverty relief .
madam chairperson , in the past we spoke about welfare ; nowadays we speak of social services in a developmental way .
madam chairperson , with reference to the hon member ms essop - i can only laugh when i look at her .
this was the result of the introduction of an allocation formula that favours provinces with a more rural base .
together with our partners in the province and in local government , we have spent r100 million since this time last year .
funding has also been provisionally approved to erect a security fence along the r300 freeway to delft and a pedestrian bridge across it .
madam chairperson , at present the funds we receive are only sufficient to provide for approximately 22 000 housing opportunities .
developers then submit project applications to the board , who adjudicate and approve the projects on the merit thereof .
currently only 76 % of posts in the department of housing are filled , and that obviously puts pressure on the officials .
if one is not from oostenberg , one will not get a house in oostenberg , but rather one in delft .
while the hon minister said that he has to think about the rentals , i want to know when we are going to introduce body corporates .
why , at that point , was the hon member mr mckenzie not allowed to proceed with this particular amendment ?
mr chairperson , the focus of developers has remained on the delivery of formal housing , with the most expensive service product offered .
the argument for this approach is that this is what the beneficiaries want , and what they say they can afford .
the influx of homeless people from other provinces is another major contributing factor to the growth of the informal housing sector .
this compact living without adequate sanitation or basic water supply negatively affects the health of the many people living under such conditions .
we in this province , and those in our local governments , need to formalise some sort of planning around this problem .
the people are being sold out by those who are staying there , because they are left empty and the skollies are staying in those houses .
i would have to thank some hon members more than others , because some hon members were more constructive and objective than others .
i said that there were projects to the value of r765 million that could not be approved because there was no money .
madam chairperson , i want to thank the hon member mr winde for the cordial words that he addressed to me .
last year i had the privilege of giving the top performer of all the towns an award of r100 000 .
the jagersbosch community in still bay and the flagship project in beaufort west to which we referred yesterday each received r35 000 as runners-up .
other aspects on which there is cooperation are housing , health , disaster management in particular , nature conservation and the improvement of the infrastructure of municipalities .
one of these factors is usually political interference in the performance of the officials ' duties , where money has to be collected .
i want to refer briefly to some of the projects on which this money will be spent , and i will refer to them according to their service category .
there are a flood working group , a drought working group , an emergency aid working group , an environmental working group , a training working group and a fire-fighting group within and outside the metropolitan area .
today i can tell hon members that the document is now ready and we can make it available for public comment .
this will be a major additional burden on me , but it is a great privilege to serve on this committee .
initially , in the non-metropolitan area , we wanted to look at making no appointments from category 0 to category 3 .
i received a letter signed by the employers , and by imatu and samwu , in which they support this proposal totally .
] honestly , if one has matters in place and has to wait for the national government , that , too , is a disaster .
of everything that he promised the people with respect to the 100-day programme we heard nothing today .
i am not even going to talk about what happens outside the metropole ; let us talk about what happens within the metropole .
let us take oostenberg as an example , seeing that its people are sitting here in large numbers and the hon minister comes from there .
do hon members know what they did for the poor people of oostenberg in terms of writing off arrear rentals ?
we are very grateful for this documentation and we thank him for his assistance to the ordinary members of this parliament .
madam chairperson , the dp will press for the maximum devolution of power and delegation of functions to those sub-councils provided for in the local government : municipal structures act , act 117 of 1998 , that have the capacity to perform their own powers and functions .
the hon minister has alluded to many of these in his very broad-ranging speech and i also now wish to amplify them .
the second key element is , we remain concerned about the financial arrangements leading up to the creation of the new structures .
are we now satisfied that our assets at local government level are being maintained intact , and that spending by all authorities remain in check ?
we will need to make much better use of our expenditure to achieve better service delivery models and in so doing generate more rates .
i am disappointed about the entire restructuring process ; not only of the unicity , but also that of the municipalities outside the metropole .
i have known messrs faan naud and michael brewis for a long time , and one does not get better than that .
if those hon members want to be centralist in their thinking , they should allow me to be federal in my thinking .
we have budgeted r1,236 million for civil protection and disaster management , yet there is no disaster fund in this whole country .
members of the new np are divided about whom they have to cooperate with to do the best for their people .
sakkie pretorius and others are kicking up a row and saying that manie schoeman is wrong to invite arnold stofile to the new np conference .
we are talking about the development of 5 500 units there , which is being led by the hon minister of housing .
i want to ask the hon member when he was last in khayelitsha to see how service has expanded .
mr speaker , on a point of order : is it possible to move an amendment to such a motion ?
a green paper on these matters is currently approaching completion under the auspices of my colleague the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism .
the gis component of the subdirectorate continues to assist local authorities , institutions and departments with their metropolitan and province-wide mapping requirements .
once again i thank the members of the standing committee who spent long days and many nights in the committee room .
madam chairperson , community development and planning was used in the heyday of apartheid to further the objective of racial segregation .
i believe that the person most suited to administering this is the minister of local government .
up to six years ago some families needed to visit the graveyards of their great-grandfathers and were prohibited from doing so .
one of the planning initiatives mentioned by the hon minister was the initiation and promotion of bioregional planning throughout the province .
all these zones are interdependent and managed and protected according to the zone definitions i have alluded to .
so , the second thing that i have learnt out of it is that we need to keep politics out of the review board proceedings .
however , madam chairperson , i also find it odd that the department of development planning is linked up with the department of finance .
if we look at the job titles , we find that there are one white chief town and regional planner and three black .
i am still asking why , in the course of these five years , we have seen local authorities struggling with this capacity building .
i hope and trust that the hon minister will provide an answer from which we shall see what we have achieved .
that is all he said on the issue , but it was a very good statement in its brevity .
i would like to say , if you permit me , madam chairperson : max , you were not at your best today !
it is not my intention to go down the road of talking about transformation or affirmative action again .
if the possibility exists that certain matters in it are unconstitutional , what would the hon member say about the land use planning ordinance ?
to this end , an independent western cape nature conservation board is planned to come into existence on 1 april 2000 .
it shows that if all those applications were approved , which is unlikely , it would have created almost 10 000 jobs .
we should not allow the politics of the hon minister to affect the importance of the issue of the environment .
i want to mention our grave concern that we are not developing our own in-house capacity to deal with environmental impact assessments .
we shall not await the results of a two-year environmental impact assessment before stopping the release of toxins into rivers .
madam chairperson , i am not going to speak about culture as a form of dancing , music , art , literature or drama today .
how do we create a culture of non-violence when murder , rape and abuse are the order of the day in this province ?
furthermore we have the succulents of the karoo which have the biggest variety of flora of any semi-dry ecosystem in the world .
with the exception of the small nature reserve at wolfgat there is no nature reserve that incorporates the marshlands of the cape flats .
must provide for the establishment and reasonable funding , within the province 's available resources , of a cultural council or councils ...
i want to refer specifically to the speeches by two previous speakers , the hon members mr a j williams and ms versfeld .
it is a pleasure to inform the hon member that various christmas choirs have received financial support in this year .
i agree wholeheartedly with the hon member that our cultural heritage is not being supported by the media in the western cape .
the hon member can rest assured , i will have a hands-on approach to funding by this cultural commission .
finally , i turn to the hon member mr king , who made a passionate plea for the reopening of the klein river mouth .
now everyone is saddled with debt of thousands of rands and the anc are sitting here in these benches as if nothing has happened .
in my opinion it is disgraceful to call members of the public the peanut gallery .
at this stage there are 75 000 houses left , and that creates the opportunity for ownership for the public .
the western cape department of transport alone can no longer meet its financial obligations as far as the roads in the province are concerned .
i would like to take the opportunity to thank the hon minister for what he is doing in the department .
madam chairperson , on the prior item , i believe we have come a long way in this matter of the metropolitan transport authority .
now we are told that a viability and feasibility study will be done to see how it will work holistically .
we must learn from this that when we design buildings , we sometimes need to get professionals in and have a more inclusive approach .
the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism spoke at length about this and his role in addressing poverty .
the department of transport and public works should be geared to dealing with poverty through the public works programme .
it is , however , my view that the implementation thereof requires long-term planning , which should make provision for job creation during the construction period .
brother johnny with his bus in manenberg must be part of this process , as must brother johnny in grassy park .
here i refer to the traditional example , namely the administrative adjudication of road traffic offences act which that minister passed .
madam chairperson , i should like to dedicate my speech today to those on the west coast for whom humans rights day has acquired a new meaning .
allowing only one company the opportunity of manufacturing these special plates is far too centralised for my liking .
our people have already had to face increases in the fuel price , and now there will be an increase of 25 % in licensing fees .
i think that everyone in the house has great appreciation for what they have done in the little karoo in recent times .
sir , the work teams worked 24 hours a day to make the roads accessible for us to travel on them .
in december 1999 we were able to hold a meeting for the first time to see to it that we could operate this thing .
there is now an argument as to whether the department should be known as " public works " or as " works " .
we have 10 500 buildings comprising a surface area of approximately 7 million m  administered by the department of works .
the question he put to me reads , and i quote from the question paper of tuesday , 14 march 2000 :
] we are now helping them , because they did not have the experience to tender .
there sits the hon lady who , next year at the scof meeting , is going to ask : " what became of the r10 million ?
madam chairperson , the initial opposition to personal number-plates has disappeared like mist before the sun .
when it is necessary to use the anc to help us to do that , we must do that .
] fortunately my wife went along , as did her husband , so nothing was done which we ought not to have done .
he categorically denies that he gave any instructions to remove cisterns or any other maintenance repair work that was done .
does the hon member mr byneveldt wish to move the motion without notice , in other words , request that the motion should come up now ?
the hon members who object may not elaborate on it further and no further discussion may be conducted on the issue .
( 4 ) calls on the minister of local government to ensure that the transformation continues ; and
( 3 ) calls on the anc to declare if they will follow the same approach in the western cape .
hon members will appreciate the fact that they cannot move motions in different words but on the same subject all day long .
on 7 september 1999 i made a policy statement to the house on the intentions of the government regarding this portfolio .
governments worldwide are forced to become facilitators of enterprise development in a much more hands-on manner than ever before .
from the input received , it soon became clear that certain aspects of the green paper would have to be revised .
to date the minister of trade and industry has given no indication as to his future policy approach on this matter .
for the purposes of these difficult decisions we need a policy framework which clearly spells out the criteria for decision-making and weighing up interests .
it is an act that has substantially in the same form been adopted in most other provinces , with the exception of kwazulu-natal .
in afrikaans the word " cluster " is translated as " tros " .
the tourism board is also going to sponsor 10 new tourism entrepreneurs from previously disadvantaged area to participate in indaba 2000 in durban .
as hon members know , cape town ranks 28th in the world as a global destination for conferences - without a conference centre .
we are very excited about this process , and our plans are on track for the centre to be opened in 2002 .
the second key factor is to initiate processes to establish the cape as a major international food and wine centre .
the provincial government and local government will be expected to contribute about 25 % of the funding .
in support of this investment promotion function , wesgro continues to produce a number of outstanding publications on sectors and general macroeconomic projections .
i am grateful , amongst others , for their taking the responsibility to get the cape film office off the ground .
the endorsement of title deeds in our name and the issuing of item 28 ( 1 ) certificates continues to be an arduous process .
madam chairperson , we have almost completed the rationalisation of rental accommodation in the city bowl ; the process is also complete in oudtshoorn .
madam chairperson , it is indeed a great pleasure to follow the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism .
the cmc , however , has kept to that financial plan , as have other local authorities , and they have kept on escalating .
i want to tell the hon minister that it is a critical thing to negotiate public / private partnerships .
madam chairperson , it is a pleasure to rise after the hon member mr gelderblom - especially after his concluding remarks .
between 1994 and 1998 employment growth occurred in those sectors , although there was a downswing in the year up to july 1999 .
every day 50 000 of our illegal operators function ; 1 500 operators have asked the liquor board for registration of liquor outlets .
this was made possible through public / private partnership and is directly empowering the public to become involved in the mainstream tourism market .
not one of the guesthouses that are now making an appearance in khayelitsha are advertised in this guide .
cape town is also an excellent venue and could become a strong global player if proposals to develop a convention centre are realised .
over the past few years , much publicity has been given to a few megaprojects related to the western cape 's tourism industry .
madam chairperson , i want to digress from that information and make a few remarks about the argument in regard to liquor licences .
it was extremely exciting to be exposed to international debate on the issues surrounding the knowledge society and the knowledge economy .
that a million people have lost their jobs since 1994 and that we are back to 1970s employment figures .
" that hon member , like me , signed an oath to uphold the constitution of this country .
if wholesalers supply liquor to retailers who are unlicensed , i would certainly consider taking the wholesalers ' licences away .
agriculture is still regarded as the source of economic growth in africa and the main counter to famine and poverty .
madam chairperson , on the subject of international competitiveness i should also like to comment briefly on the price of diesel .
secondly , the return on government investment in technology is higher if it can be developed in conjunction with national and international partners .
the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism ought to investigate the possibility that state land could be used for these projects .
increasing use is being made of contract workers and mechanisation , as the chairperson of the standing committee mentioned .
let us look at some of the agricultural industries , and view them in the light of the input costs as against the poor production prices .
as the result of mass dumping of milk-related products , the price of milk is now 10 cents per litre lower than three years ago .
for example , people who do not see ostriches every day can be taken through an ostrich farm on a coach .
circumstances are such that bokkie is totally dependant on the farm shop on the farm where she works and lives .
what is more , he also remembers all the help he received - the land bank of south africa , state subsidies , institutional and research support .
i should also like to lead a delegation and take the hon minister along , so that he could learn to know those areas .
let me say that the same rules apply when the speaker , the deputy speaker or any one of the temporary chairpersons is in the chair .
( 1 ) expresses its discontent with the events in zimbabwe , where human rights are being violated and the cornerstones of democracy are being disregarded ;
( 3 ) believes that the statement by the deputy president on 17 april 2000 is a step in the right direction .
that the house recognises the comments made by mr justice heath that this province was the cleanest where his investigations were concerned .
" i believe we can communicate more efficiently to let the people know what we are achieving .
the bavarian car manufacturer , audi , is to sponsor young artistes from the western cape to perform in bavaria during the european summer .
the western cape is the only region in africa , and one of only two regions outside europe , to be given this status .
alternatively , he should give the western cape its own full provincial policing powers and the budget to go with it .
the " old coffins on four wheels " to which president mbeki also referred on friday must be taken off our roads .
america 's world watch says the state of nature throughout the world is not at all good .
being obsessed with centralising power is not the example someone like laurent kabila wants to learn from .
in 1997 we accepted the same type of legislation by unanimously passing the western cape municipal ordinance , 1974 amendment bill .
mr speaker , on a point of order : the hon member mr ramatlakane is misleading the house factually .
this they did by taking some of these emerging entrepreneurs from khayelitsha to an indaba in durban last week .
however , the hon member mr ramatlakane comes here and waxes bitter , but he has expressed his support of the whole amendment .
we were compelled to draft the amendment bill whether or not other provinces had already done so two to three years ago .
we are still in a situation in which the security forces and the saps can do the work with the necessary support .
we must also take into account that it is not only the bus and taxi companies that are at issue here .
i am really pleased that we were able to convert that clause to some extent and link it up with the original act .
it is important that we who are the chief spokesmen on transport and are in the midst of this thing , respect one another .
i acceded and asked the hon premier to give us time to draft a well-considered bill .
mr speaker , provision is made - and in that regard i must grab my friend by the throat - for objections .
in uitsig and matroosfontein in particular there is tremendous mourning ; there is anxiety and uncertainty , and there is despair .
he prefers to attend a ratepayers ' meeting at tokai - he does not see his way clear to going to uitsig and elsies river .
she chases teachers around , cane in hand , and sends e-mails about her understanding of predominantly jewish and muslim schools .
we do not carry guns , knives or ak-47s and most of the time we do not take the law into our own hands in retaliation .
i am not condoning it , what i am saying is that there have been murderers on both sides of the political spectrum .
mr speaker , i should like to conclude , hopefully with the agreement of the house , by singling out another point .
sir , the recent incidents of violence , not only in elsies river and ravensmead , are cause for concern for all of us .
the 15-year-old ravensmead girl , crescendo august , who was murdered over the weekend , was a grade 6 pupil in my class four years ago .
the errors of the teacher and the church are sitting in pollsmoor and the errors of the doctor are lying in the graveyard .
the hon minister must stop making cheap politics out of the death and sorrow of brown people on the cape flats .
in addition , all the detectives , all the intelligence members and all the members of the special forces must be deducted from this number .
mr speaker , let me tell the hon member ms essop , with respect , we have to be fairly serious about this .
the nai then became involved , because they were attacked , and after that the national government was dragged into the whole story .
we must say to them , " men , you are doing good work , " but where are those hon members when that takes place ?
the police were only notified when the press came out with it , and the anc made a fuss about it .
i gave them a cheque for r60 000 , but they said that i did not want to cooperate with them .
unfortunately , in his speech today the hon member mr byneveldt did something which i must stop here and now .
sir , this letter was sent on 17 november 1998 and we had to bring it to the people 's attention on the same day .
after all , we cannot argue - and water down our powers here - that we cannot authorise it .
when we called them to national service for voter registration , they were not as keen .
" the dp once again , with its coalition partner the new np , has conducted itself in an immoral , shameless , unethical way .
mr speaker , we certainly assisted and supported national government , because that is where the request came from .
it was a campaign , so my party and i strongly believe , that gerrymandered the requirements for voters in south africa .
when the court case was lost , the dp and the new np sprang into action - too little , too late .
the chairperson of scopa should answer to the house on how he believes the case should be handled .
independent pollsters now show that if the election were held tomorrow , the anc would win with an overall majority .
should the error not be sought in the anc central government that did not plan scientifically and in an orderly fashion for the 1999 election ?
and not only to speak with reference to a position linked to me or anything else .
owing to my lack of knowledge as to the procedure followed in handling this matter , i cannot elaborate on that .
the deputy chairperson of the anc in the western cape , the hon member mr fransman , should listen carefully to what his members are saying .
they allow the hon member ms essop to run circles around them , taking them completely off the track .
the question before the house today is whether we as the house , when the minister does not in terms of ...
madam chairperson , i would like to know on which days the actual expenditures took place in terms of the r65 000 .
madam chairperson , the hon minister indicated to me which programme the r30 000 came from .
i recall that there was an amount of r1 000 in terms of payment if they work all three days .
as far as pollution and the brown issues are concerned , the request for r1 million was made long after this ever happened .
madam chairperson , i spoke to mr johan fourie , who is the deputy director-general in charge of finance , before this debate .
madam chairperson , on a point of information : i was asked questions across the floor and i just want to ...
four people who work in the office of the premier had to assist with the registration on 5 , 6 and 7 march .
where in the vote it comes from i do not know , but there again it is a case of ditto , ditto .
madam chairperson , between the two hon ministers , could we get an explanation for the remainder of the r316 000 ...
madam chairperson , i leave it to your discretion to rule whether i am in contempt of the house or not .
if an hon member insults an hon minister or attacks his / her person , then i can protect him / her .
however , i can tell her , to save a further question , that 23 people were involved at r1 000 a time .
- or womanpower - but that we could not afford to do that and that we needed to be reimbursed .
it is clear , the hon minister has to explain how he applied his mind because he cannot give us answers ...
madam chairperson , the other side of the house has made the assertion that in other provinces it was done voluntarily .

south africa has the fourth highest income distribution gap in the world based on the gini coefficient , and the western cape has the highest in south africa .
our pass rate is the highest in the country and i would like to congratulate the hon minister of education for this achievement .
i want the whole house to commend our provincial traffic services for an excellent job done during this festive season .
that is certainly an ambitious vision , seen against the background of the enormity of the problems in the community and the availability of resources .
these key measurable objectives try to reach all levels of society and through all the different communities .
the department and i would like to use this opportunity to thank every official for the work already done .
mr speaker , in my tradition we have a totem which says , " he that helps himself or herself will also be assisted .
these critical issues cannot be addressed only by good political speeches ; they need good strategies , planning and commitment .
the hon premier spoke about a number of things that should happen and things that he intends to do .
i must say that the hon premier was the minister of police services for two years and the plan is still coming .
mr speaker , i wish to point out further that the provincial commissioner of police has been appointed for approximately a year now .
if that does not happen then a good occasion , as in the case of the n2 , will be seen as nothing but political opportunism .
we were able to have monitoring cameras installed along vanguard drive with the assistance of the business sector and in the central business area of cape town .
this statement took us right back to the time of peter makoba 's " kill a farmer , kill a boer " .
yesterday the people expected the hon premier to tell them when the job opportunities would be created for them .
mr speaker , let me inform the house about the situation in riebeeck-kasteel near malmesbury .
here the da council sold four rdp houses which together are valued at more than r60 000 for less than r20 000 .
the hon premier says he shares the concerns and wants to give a helping hand to the people of this province .
they are mature enough to know that the development of the western cape is interconnected with the development of south africa .
there are significant inputs and contributions made by the rest of south africa that contribute positively to the western cape economy .
take the events at van rhynsdorp as an example , and see who claimed for themselves the successes achieved by other people .
during their recently completed lekgotla at citrusdal they indicated that they want to devote special attention to the rural areas .
the day after those people left , the farmer used his neighbour 's harvester to harvest the crop .
mr speaker , one of the decisions taken at this meeting related to the administration of nevirapine .
is the western cape proposing to secede from the rest of the country and the world on the issue of mtct transmission ?
mr speaker , i do not want to respond to that because mr noludwe himself was involved in the allocation of the sites .
do you remember telling me at pick ' n pay that you wished you were in the anc ?
an elderly man , mr hanker , developed tuberculosis after working on the farm verwoerd in suider paarl for eight years .
mr speaker , we are grateful that the situation in rural areas is a serious matter to the hon premier .
those are people who owe more than r5 000 and they are people who have been charged and found guilty of misbehaving .
this person had not intended laying a charge , but after political interference he laid a charge .
the leaders of the anc appeared in court in large numbers after mr jonker had to sleep in cells that night .
mr speaker , agriculture contributes 4 % to the economy , but 10 % to the workforce in the province .
they claim that from about 1997 until 1999 the established bus operators outsourced or subcontracted out to them the transport of tourists .
but they are no longer black entrants who get the work , they are new white entrants who get the work .
i concede that the senior partner of the anc made it difficult for them in the rest of the country .
public opinion strongly condemned the anc , but therefore they did not do the right things .
mr speaker , i should also like to refer to the polemic that has developed recently about generic medicine .
i must emphasise that the western cape department of health are not here to protect the profits of pharmaceutical companies .
mr speaker , i do not take it amiss of the opposition if they run out of steam to such an extent by this time of the evening .
the money was in the department of social services and it has now been rolled over into the department of the hon premier .
the then anc-led cape town city council , together with the province and the national department , were involved in putting the cameras in place .
mr speaker , i would firstly like to thank my department and mr langenhoven for the work that they did .
] - correct , there is a shopping centre attached - and i understand that they cleaned out a complete jewellery shop .
it involved only the cameras - our contribution - and the total amount spent on it was r13 million .
as i mentioned at a previous sitting , we paid out approximately r3 million after a long period to certain professionals .
he said he would come with a business plan , and as soon as it is ready the hon member will receive it .
installation on the n2 , which the hon member mentioned in his speech earlier , is not really a big issue .
the intention is to let the camera network coincide with those geographic areas which we believe need to receive intensive attention .
i was listening to the department making a presentation on this subject this morning and it was explained to the committee .
the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism answered that question earlier and i think that he answered it correctly .
( 2 ) the desperate circumstances which the workers and dwellers of the farm koelpark in the koelenhof region find themselves in ; and
on 27 march 2000 discussions began between the taxi association codeta and golden arrow , after golden arrow had been threatened by them .
two taxi associations - webta and laguna at the time - were fighting each other for control over routes and ranks .
if he were to close them tomorrow and the violence were to escalate or spill over to other places , he would also be criticised .
communities were hoping to see something being done , but it was in vain - there is no change .
mr speaker , to complete the factual dissertation , it is also true that the anc has already politicised the debate .
" but when they want to gain political mileage , they instruct the police to go softly on law enforcement .
they are not allowed to enjoy the constitutional right of a safe environment - is that what she is saying ?
] this is because we need not only a representative board , but one that works on the best of criteria .
in khayelitsha , where the hon member ms phenduka lives , there are half a million people making use of public transport .
i want to ask the hon member ms essop who on that side of the house made such an allegation .
we cannot simply take anybody and put him on the board because he is a member of the taxi association .
i called this sitting because i wanted to inform hon members of the house and the public in general of our position .
if i give the udm the opportunity , then i must give the anc , the dp , the acdp and the new np the opportunity .
i am not prepared to give in to the taxi companies and not have law and order enforced .
mr speaker , i do want to refer to the input by the hon member mr lewis in regard to the standing committee .
however , this is the first time that the hon member dr van zyl has transgressed , so i will allow it .
] there are objections and the motion will appear on the order paper for possible discussion at a later date .
by and large , these centres are not money-spinners , but they are enormous generators of wealth for the region .
secondly , i want to thank mr pierre oosthuizen of my office who is already a veteran as regards legislation in this parliament .
as he said , convention visitors and their spouses will spend considerable sums of money on accommodation , wining and dining , shopping and sight-seeing .
mr speaker , we regard the convention centre initiative as crucial for tourism growth in the province , and we support the hon minister in this .
we are asked to authorise this province 's shareholding in convenco , and the shareholding is governed by the shareholders ' agreement .
i will deal with one of them , and that is the question of the issuing of guarantees by the province .
convention centres have their origin as far back as 1865 in europe where the caf royal was started by a parisian wine merchant .
the caf royal is one of europe 's largest conference and banqueting centres , catering for up to 3 000 guests at any one time .
our venue will be modern , flexible and technologically advanced , unlike many older convention centres in europe , and north america for that matter .
the world-class convention centre is a welcome injection in the further expansion and development of tourism in this fine province of ours .
the success of this convention centre will also depend largely on professional international marketing , effective liaison and effective coordination among the various role-players .
secondly , they realised that clause 2 explicitly stated that we were authorising a shareholding .
he said , for instance , that the first part of the clause only covered the convenco agreement and not the shareholders ' agreement .
i want to tell the hon member that the house is not being asked to ratify or authorise any shareholders ' agreement .
i always enjoy debating with her and she seems to relish the prospect as well .
on the empowerment issue , let me tell hon members that we are bound by the gambling board arrangements regarding empowerment .
madam chairperson , on a point of order : i believe that what is happening now is incorrect .
provincial treasury 's reply to resolution 3 of the report of the standing committee on public accounts dated 31 may 1999
vote 11 - education ( auditor-general 's report [ pr85 / 1999 - page 8 , paragraph 3.12 ] ) : catering services
if the hon minister was given the wrong guidance , why did he not listen to the official of the department ?
if bonteheuwel , his own constituency , turned their backs on him on 2 june 1999 , what good can come out of gadara ?
we have had enough of them . they want to take over everywhere and therefore i am pleased that the hon minister made provision for this .
the hon member mr mckenzie has referred to the fact that the bill excludes one option , that of executive mayor .
as far as can be ascertained , anc-controlled provinces are pushing for the very opposite of this western cape model , that is , an all-powerful executive mayor .
sir , i did not see the hon member mr mckenzie again , nor did i see any member of the anc .
when we get to 1 november , or as the newspapers now report , 2 december , i believe things will go well .
mr speaker , to begin with , on behalf of this side of the house we wish to pay tribute to the late chief justice ismail mahomed .
mr speaker , what i now have to say is specifically for the attention of the hon member mr dugmore .
political discontent or dissatisfaction with the outcome of a case is not justification for recklessly attacking the integrity of judicial officers .
by that i do not seek to intimate that anyone who does not have that exposure will necessarily make unfair findings .
in the louis luyt / sarfa case the then minister of justice , mr omar , said that all pre-1994 judges were biased .
is the hon minister as minister of community safety , sport and recreation playing a useful role by questioning those ...
mr speaker , hon members also need to understand that many people support what the anc is suggesting .
i would like to say that the house should also be sensitive to the fact that when our members and supporters ...
it was not the white afrikaners that moved into constantia , which had belonged to the muslims , or into tramway road .
it will still die if that is not the case , but perhaps over a longer period of time .
on the one hand we have the rightist dp and sections of the new np who defend and preserve white privilege .
] i must honestly say to hon members that i am not going to say today that we were satisfied with that .
i wonder if we could not investigate where he actually is , if you would not mind , mr speaker .
the numbers of complaints about access to finance that have come our way have , unfortunately , not come from white businesses .
the new np commits itself to the creation of an environment which will promote small , medium and micro businesses and eliminate restrictive factors .
contrary to this the smmes tell us about events such as the recent story referred to by the hon member ms essop .
we have been informed that the banks demand fixed assets or personal life insurance as collateral security before granting guarantees for bridging finance .
the budget of the nsbc should be redirected into opportunity vouchers which unemployed people can exchange for business training programmes and micro-enterprise start-up kits .
sir , the issue that is being debated is a critically important one and i am very pleased that we are debating it .
hon members must go and speak to enoch goragwana , wiwu from the eastern cape and the mec in gauteng and the other provinces .
the hon member mr ramatlakane , obviously , tried to take a side-swipe at the dp to vilify us .
despite the protestations from the hon member ms essop , i think we were able to get to the truth at the end of the day .
the standing committee on public accounts , having heard and considered evidence on certain aspects included in the -
the copier in question is currently still in use and was , among others , utilised to produce the 1998 and 1999 examination papers .
( a ) the tender board in its consideration of the ex post facto request indeed had no legal mandate ;
we do not have a motion before us , therefore i do not think we can take a point of order .
( 3 ) calls on all banks to reconsider their criteria for the support of this very critical sector .
( 2 ) that thousands of seabirds , including penguins , cormorants and gannets faced death from this disaster ;
( 4 ) that thousands of capetonians from diverse backgrounds volunteered their time and effort to assist in this clean-up operation ;
the hon premier is well aware of this because he would remember how we as a region fought about this issue .
it immediately becomes clear that the people of clifton have been benefiting , on the back of the greater part of the citizens of this city .
it is the paradox of the government that while it tries to do much , it also fails to do the essential .
madam speaker , i have been asked to speak because our provincial leader , mr rasool , has a family crisis to deal with .
the anc has been fighting poverty and it will continue to champion the fight against poverty .
one of the biggest problems with this draft legislation that is on the table is that it was drafted in secrecy .
] that is going to be one of the things that we need in the metropolitan area - not in the ...
they did not need a two-thirds majority and therefore they could not even have been vetoed in regard to the budget .
agriculture provides 38 % of the formal job opportunities in our rural areas and maintains approximately 1,2 million people in the western cape .
good , prime agricultural land belongs to a small minority while brown and black emerging farmers are being settled on relatively poor agricultural land .
there are provinces with which we can have sympathy , particularly gauteng and kwazulu-natal , where things are going far worse at the moment .
a great deal of research has already been done about this and it appears as though in many of the cases crime plays a major role .
i agree with the hon member mr fransman that that does not even begin to constitute a motivation or justification for their actions .
however , this must not be seen as a precedent , because it could be very dangerous if members continued with this .
i want to thank the speakers who made a positive contribution and in particular the hon minister of community safety .
i want to express my concern about what we have heard from the hon member mr byneveldt over the last few minutes .
mr speaker , what is happening is that we are soft on our criminals and we are quiet - we do not hear about that .
mr speaker , may i address you on that before i react further , or do you just want me to withdraw it ?
the hon minister may certainly address me first , after which i shall give a final ruling to which the hon minister must react .
there is , firstly , the protection of the man in the street against unscrupulous operators and more specifically illegal operators ...
the time has now come for the province 's investment in the western cape gambling and racing board to start bearing fruit .
we are continually closing loopholes in the law , which will make it more difficult for illegal operators to escape criminal charges .
it is therefore recommended that certain categories of staff working in the horse-racing industry be exempted from being licensed by the board .
the hon premier withdrew it and then continued with another statement , which he is allowed to do .
mr wiley is however still a member of the party , and this is a political task team that i appointed .
his own legal counsel on convenco indicated that they could not give an opinion on the constitutionality of the matter .
mr speaker , we are saying that the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism has to abide by the national constitution .
was it simply to suggest that the anc was playing petty politics launching personal attacks , and so on ?
it goes without saying , of course , that interests in the hotel industry in areas adjacent to the convention centre constitute such a conflict .
the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism was not even a member of this provincial government at that time .
mr speaker , i cannot tell you how delighted i am to be able to take part in this debate .
the only time one needs to make a disclosure in terms of the companies act , and mrs - is it ms or mrs ?
he was exactly 14 minutes late , as he usually is , not being at the convention centre meeting at 07 : 00 .
and then i left it for a period of time , which i can only judge to be 10 or 15 seconds .
i suggest that if one goes the latter route 90 % of public company directors would have to resign .
i agree with the hon premier when he says that he refuses to believe that pagad is the culprit .
democracy is also being charged with neglect of duty , particularly since it is apparently unable to protect the community .
at one stage the then government came to its senses and realised that they had to speak to those terrorists .
an encouraging trend emerged out of the taxi conflict - after the present hon minister of community safety took over , i may add .
mr speaker , i take pleasure in following the hon leader of the opposition , who i think made an outstanding contribution .
the second fundamental principle is that there can be no order without justice and , similarly , no justice without order .
in so far as progress in dealing with the terror campaign is concerned , the security forces conducted an intensive joint planning session last week .
they made the deputy minister for justice and constitutional development , the national minister of correctional services and their senior officials available .
" we do not cut your kind of hair here , " was the reply when someone went there for a haircut .
we need to devise drastic measures to identify , discourage , curb and punish perpetrators of racial discrimination .
they could have elected a black leader if they wanted to , but i do not want to see that as preferential colour treatment .
die samesmelting tussen die da en die np is niks anders as ' n oorgawe van die afrikaner aan die engelsman nie .
] they have four coloureds , six whites and not a single - to play their word game - black african .
mr speaker , in the da itself it was only recently , interestingly enough , that they acquired a black african .
mr speaker , the fact is that when the anc unmasks this reality , they accuse us of being the racists .
to do this it has to paint all whites who do not happen to belong to the anc as a racist enemy .
very often it is a characteristic of anc affirmative action that if someone does not carry the membership card of a certain party ...
i want to remind the whole house that last year at one stage 28 directors-general were appointed at national level .
the anc government has failed the people by pursuing a set of contradictory economic policies without prioritisation .
not only does it seek to avoid a discussion of race and racism , but to render it illegitimate .
in fact , that day dene smuts came closer to the white mineworkers ' union than all the other whites who were there .
this is not a case of , as someone put it , making someone welcome if they have an anc ticket .
mr speaker , the hon member mr lewis said that the administration failed to make the necessary appointments .
( 3 ) calls on the minister of community safety to announce measures to curb this increasing menace .
mr speaker , permit me to deal with the major adjustments which total r355 million .
mr speaker , many of the farmers in the western cape watch television and hear on the radio what is happening on farms .
the anc is in the process of clarifying these matters so that the people in the western cape can understand them .
madam speaker , this is a road which the western cape farmers and their employees must take together to the benefit of both .
the wages of farm workers in the province are approximately r365 per month for men and r282 for women .
i request the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works to go to that farm and carry out an investigation .
mr speaker , i want to extend my sincere thanks to the hon members messrs gelderblom and winde for their positive contributions to the debate .
( vi ) african renaissance and international co-operation fund bill [ b65-2000 ] .
that more clarity be provided regarding transitional funding arrangements for devolving the tourist guide function from national level to provincial level .
the standing committee on public accounts , having heard and considered evidence on certain aspects included in the -
( c ) the standard and effectiveness of training which has been provided to staff of the relevant security firms be determined ;
a progress report on the forensic audit should be submitted to the committee within 30 days of the date of this report .
public health sector service providers may purchase laboratory services from the nhls ( " may " is substituted for " must " ) .
( xvii ) african renaissance and international co-operation fund bill [ b65b-2000 ] .
the committee recommends that - ( a ) the amount of r201 654,18 be authorised by the provincial parliament ;
report of the public service commission on career management in the public service .
no , i am sure the hon minister of social services and poverty relief will come to the bill and the reasons shortly .
they can also discuss that and therefore i must allow the hon minister of social services and poverty relief to do it .
had the rest of the ministers been sitting for their matric exams , they would have added to the dismal record of matric examination results .
where they were deployed and what the result of their work was , not simply that 786 000 voters were registered .
that is what the hon minister of finance and development planning did yesterday - dictionaries , jokes about suckers and so on .
on 16 november 1998 the rev lulumile mbete , the director-general of gauteng province , wrote to the director-general of this province .
what has happened is that the dp / new np government of this province has ignored that fact and wasted the money .
] if the new np and the dp apply the very same tactic in a standing committee , they call it " bulldozing " .
this is a more common sense approach , not only for analytical purposes , but also resulting in greater transparency .
] there are objections , and therefore it will appear on the order paper for possible discussion at a later date .
mr speaker , by the same token i want to congratulate all the iec officials and educators who were involved in the local government election .
firstly , i would like to refer to what the hon premier said in his opening address , and i quote :
is this a partnership to benefit only those entrepreneurs whose initiatives and contributions to the economy have always been supported ?
we saw evidence of this in the recent local government elections when the stayaways by so-called supporters of the anc occurred .
mr speaker , the hon premier is absolutely correct when he compares tourism to the discovery of gold on the rand .
how close this is to the current performance of the anc government at both the national and the various provincial levels !
like in zimbabwe only succeeds in keeping the poor , poor and keeping the cronies and party hacks wealthy .
now there has been a massive coloured stayaway from the elections and , therefore , of those who did not vote for the da .
they literally moved their base , their headquarters , from gauteng to the western cape - here in cape town , down the road .
this will be just like the northern cape , the eastern cape and the various other parts of the country where they have lost .
if one looks at the election results , one will see the inroads made by the anc into those communities .
this is an evil that i have been fighting tooth and nail since my first day in this office , and i ...
in a decade of government the anc has yet to make a substantial difference to the living standards of the poor .
such actions by the anc government convince no one , and even hardened anc supporters such as ben turok question the route being followed .
it is clear to us that there is a significant change of tone and some content in his opening address this year , compared to last year .
i want to challenge the house to consider visiting the people who live on the east side of the n2 .
] his reply testifies to the fact that they have no direction and that they are still hammering away with the old half-baked rhetoric .
we should each take out r1 and give it to sport , rather than buy sweets with it .
mr speaker , the summer games project was a huge success , reaching more than 15 000 children during the school vacation .
we all know that the western cape is riding the crest of the wave in regard to tourism and a very ...
the strategy of the da in the recent local government elections had nothing to do with issues of local government .
the lesson for the da in 1999 was that they did not get their core constituency out to vote .
mr speaker , the house can clearly see that it was indeed the da 's strategy to racialise the campaign .
i am sorry to disappoint her , but the election results show that their analysis is narrow and hides the facts .
at least mr verwoerd not only thought these things but he had the conviction to say them .
all this needs to take place with full recognizance of the existing patterns of land ownership and a plan to redress them .
the nnp office in elsies river was closed , but a month before the elections it opened and one saw activity there .
it is a pity to have to say this , but the anc members in the councils would have liked to take part in the executive committee .
] i do not now what is discussed in their inner circles - this is all that i can imagine is being discussed .
] there are objections , and therefore it will appear on the order paper for possible discussion at a later date .
( 1 ) notes with shock the severe damage caused by the devastating mountain fire in gordon 's bay and surrounding areas ;
( 3 ) expresses its thanks to the staff of the emergency services and the fire brigade for their assistance in this regard .
( 2 ) further noting that , despite this commitment , the premier has failed to provide this information ; and

it is an age associated with retirement , but that is something i have not even thought of yet .
the hon minister of community safety correctly referred to the cooperation with the national government and the necessity of good relations .
i also thank him for the encouraging report on the foundation for cooperation laid during the demarcation and voter registration processes .
he should also look out for the dominee , because i hear that he has his eye on the position of leader of the anc .
in fact , mr speaker , i was heartened to hear that the hon leader of the opposition wants me gone .
to quote the hon member mr strachan , " if that is not racism , then please tell me what is .
on his return , the western cape education department referred him to the cape town school clinic for placement in a school .
the hon premier said that despite budget constraints , the government have delivered to all our people , especially the poor .
i also want to congratulate the former minister of social services and poverty relief , as well as the official in charge , mr colin du sart .
we believe that the inherent health and development level of a community can be measured according to how one cares for those in need of assistance .
the painfully imploring eyes of our women and children , particularly those on the cape flats , are fixed on the hon premier .
" give us our own cops .
the founder of the world-famous microsoft company , bill gates , goes to great lengths to ensure that his company rewards thinkers amply .
new ideas for creating work and sustaining it must also be generated and rewarded here at home .
he refused either to say " yes , the iec has requested assistance " , or , " no , it has not " .
it is unfortunate that the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism said it was nobody 's responsibility .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon premier why he keeps on dividing the people of the province ?
the hon minister in the office of the premier said that she had appointed directors ; directors doing what ?
it is clear that we have nothing to hide or fear from the criticism of the anc .
the hon premier is a total discredit to the community and they have already given him a vote of no confidence .
the fact of the matter is , if one person is killed in constantia , the hon minister will be found there .
no , it is not in order and the hon minister has reached a point where she should discipline herself .
] if only she could be big enough not to wait for a director in a company to ...
mr speaker , they no longer ask what the new np is going to do ; they are off the political agenda .
we listened to them , and their inputs have been incorporated in the implementation plans of the cabinet .
they were led by - i should rather say influenced by - the hon member mr dugmore .
we cannot just give money to any other organ of state and then allow that money ultimately to be misused .
they could not have asked the hon premier to talk about these achievements if they were beneficiaries thereof .
we all know that disinvestment means no jobs , intoned poverty and a further increase in the rate of crime .
other advantageous components of local infrastructure include three well-developed national motorways , linking cape town to the rest of south africa .
mr speaker , over the past two or three days that we have been in session , we have been listening to the criticism from the anc .
if hon members say that apartheid lives , then it does indeed live , but then it lives on that side of the house .
his opening address contained much food for thought for parliamentarians , and there are many positive aspects of policy about which we can all get very excited .
mr speaker , cooperation with the central government is also going well , according to feedback from our coalition cabinet .
mr speaker , their grandmothers have never post-1994 still entered through the back door of a doctor 's surgery .
while it is pointless to try and enlighten the anc , ordinary people - particularly the poor - are far more sensible .
over the past four years we have built 24 schools , many of them to accommodate these very needy , poor children .
from this kind of response it is clear to me that the hon premier is not in touch with the issues .
let me ask the hon minister in the office of the premier whether we are really looking into the issue of transformation .
some of the children who are among the 92 % that the hon premier spoke about have failed mathematics and science .
they impress people outside with their rosy programmes and policies for delivery , but where are the results of the programmes ?
the police are losing between 40 and 60 members every month as a result of death , resignations and things of that nature .
i said that i wanted to bring to his attention a letter that i got from one of the magistrates ' courts .
it is clear that the pass rate percentage that the hon minister of education is proud of is concentrated only in a few schools .
she , as a leader responsible for the disabled and as a women , is supposed to have a vision .
in the eastern cape 70 % of primary health care clinics are open today , but 30 % are without any medicine and water .
last year 's expenditure on stores in the chso was r63 million , which worked out roughly at r30 per patient .
it has gone up from 180 000 per month to 220 000 per month , 40 000 more than in the previous year .
we must also redeploy all available policemen where they are needed most - away from jobs in which they perform clerical functions .
why is it necessary for policemen to guard statues , while the lives of the people of our communities are threatened daily ?
all the law-abiding people of this country want is for criminals to be nailed and jailed .
mr slabbert then went to the graafwater police station , after which constable van lill took mr baadjies prisoner and ...
] no , it would do no good for me to give those hon members the details . they do nothing anyway .
i believe that mr baadjies pondered on the whys and wherefores of the situation over and over again as he sat there in that police van .
madam speaker , i would like to congratulate the hon premier and thank him for his outstanding opening address .
i want to talk briefly about the extension of security of tenure act , 1997 ( act 62 of 1997 ) .
mr van schalkwyk must be very worried about this , and it should be a wake-up call to him .
if hon members are going to heckle - and we generally do heckle - they should try not to give a running commentary .
i would love to challenge the hon mr ramatlakane outside this house on that interjection , because it is absolute nonsense .
( a ) multi-year budgets - as reflected in the medium-term expenditure framework or mtef - and the new government finance statistics budget formats .
i am pleased to be able to report that total provincial and education spending is at last bottoming out .
with respect to health , given the substantial increases in allocation to this vote , there are specific conditions attached to these increases . among them are :
while our powers in this regard are constitutionally limited to monitoring and oversight , projects such as operation chrysalis have great merit .
( f ) national government has expressed its intention to implement the allowed list for provincial taxation later this year .
as an example , the records of two of the province 's largest departments - health and education - are worthy of mention .
i would like to thank the national minister of finance and his officials of the team finance for their cooperation at budget council .
the impact of the year 2000 on computer systems in national departments and provincial administrations [ rp 39 / 1999 ] ;
i sent a delegation of top officials to these provinces last week to determine where we can be of assistance .
sir , i will not read the paragraphs under the headings , " budget documentation " and " acknowledgements " , into the record .
mr speaker , i would like to raise the point of efficiency and the well-resourced nature of the province .
we hope that the dp will see their resolution through to its proper conclusion , and not complain about the influx of people into the western cape .
are they being open and honest when they say it is for voter registration , or is there something else going on behind the scenes ?
at the latest that concession was to have been reallocated in october 1998 , 18 months ago , by the national department of environment affairs .
this budget is the clearest and most far-reaching commitment to the war against poverty of any government at any level in south africa .
after all , it is true that hon members on this side of the house are positive about the future of the western cape .
i would like to echo the words of the hon member mr ozinsky when he referred to the mtef and the gfs .
mr speaker , how can we have a provincial government where only one department has put a policy framework on the table ?
we have said here from time to time that we want these companies to be western cape-based .
any entrant that enters by way of corruption should be condemned and steps should be taken to reverse that .
we saw one crisis after the other being created in expenditure shortages , overexpenditure and so on .
i remember when there was a refusal to reprioritise and to create a basis for equity and so on .
for example , we tried to show that by rationalising our expenditure in various departments , we could also expand our service base .
i want to point out to the hon member mr ozinsky that we do complain that we are not getting enough money .
i nearly called the hon member mr strachan " minister " , but that is very far in the distant future .
the ffc has recommended that the provinces should have their own tax , but central government has not accepted this .
as i said in my speech the other day in the ncop , i came up with the idea of an airport tax .
madam chairperson , in my budget speech today i would like to touch on several aspects on how i see further developments in our province .
both the gender equality and disability desks are up and running and are focusing on provincial awareness programmes which link up with national and international days .
i will consult with sanco in the near future as well as other cbos and civics in informal settlements to solicit their opinions .
allow me a few words on hiv / aids before the anc accuses me of ignoring this major threat .
it is a good start , but we are going to need a bit more than the one notch at standards and poor .
it is therefore , as a matter from the heart , that i repeat my plea to hon members on both sides of the house .
] their reckless disregard of the facts could become an embarrassment to them again , as has happened in the past .
madam chairperson , on a point of order : is it parliamentary for the hon minister to call three hon members liars ?
as regards the budget allocation for this , all the above , except the development of the monitoring and evaluation tool , will be developed and formulated in-house .
it was stated earlier that there was some duplication of transformation initiatives by the directorate : corporate services and this office .
as far as my portfolio is concerned , i call upon each hon member of the provincial parliament please to refrain from petty politics .
the system of job evaluation that has been envisaged for a long time ought also to be given effect to officially in this financial year .
furthermore , the overall upgrading especially of external communication initiatives to enhance two-way communication between the province and the community will receive priority attention .
the directorate 's registry , typing , messenger and reprographic services are currently being investigated for possible decentralisation during the course of this financial year .
i also wish to thank my colleagues for their cooperation and the hon premier for his outstanding leadership of this province .
madam chairperson , i would further like to know if any of the disabled sectors were part of the drawing up of that special project .
madam chairperson , this vote contains many diverse elements , many of them crucial to the functioning of this parliament .
i find that there are conflicting statements , because the hon premier said in his speech that such a document did exist .
if they are not sector-driven , that would mean that they are being negotiated in a vacuum with the other province .
we are not certain about the aspect of communication , as contained in the " professional and special services " section .
we also support the notion of the cabinet to the people and we are glad to see that this will take place four times a year .
for me the core problem is , how does one shift the family structure from being completely destructive ...
there are two difficulties linked with jrg haider.the one is that he plays down all the crimes of the nazi period .
mr chairperson , it is all very well to say that we can put this or that in place .
they have to come up with a plan to make the building more accessible , particularly the entrance to 7 wale street .
the hon member mr louis also referred to the communication programme , as did the hon member mr n m isaacs .
one thing they did not mention , however , although somebody did mention it here , is that the anc are derailers .
] no , they were not interested in hearing what she was saying , because their minds had been made up .
amongst other things , i said that africa was expected to be the world 's fastest-growing region in the year 2000 .
i also said that africa was home to 70 % of all people over the world suffering from aids .
the anc knew that , and looked at the scoreboard and said , " fine , these other guys have not got it .
on page 6 , in line 21 , after " responsible minister " , to insert " after consultation with the board " .
to my mind the present system is too lenient , and it does not promote discipline in the house and its committees .
for that reason , on this particular issue , we on this side of the house object to that funding mechanism .
herein lies the crux of the matter : " to serve the citizens of the western cape optimally " .
however , this administration needs to be more adequately funded , just as we , as members , have the need of better backup and infrastructure .
at present the existing committee clerks are overburdened with work and the committee chairpersons are not able to perform their own duties adequately owing to these staffing restrictions .
in consultation with the hon minister of finance and development planning , they worked out a viable feasibility study and they should be congratulated .
this function is expressed in section 23 ( 2 ) of the provincial constitution , which holds that , and i quote :
it is not so far-fetched , and i think the committee chairpersons of whatever party cannot sleep easy .
my colleague over there , the hon member mr lewis , has referred to the paucity of resources allocated to committees .
it might be that a particular former member has such expertise in a particular area that we can use him or her .
the hon member mr king went on to request that the same committees be involved again , after the appropriation bill has been formally tabled .
as far as the demographics of the province are concerned , we have not reached our target yet - i fully admit it .
particularly when we are looking for skilled african people for parliamentary jobs , we look to the national parliament and experience this problem .
those hon members ' own parties have been working with the iec and said that the elections were always free and fair .
this expenditure is being financed by the office of the hon premier and it is being run by the office of the director-general .
or will they , because of the mistrust on that side of the house , ask their own members not to register .
( 4 ) it is impossible to quantify the number of litres of water used , as it was not measured .
the hon minister knew that the hon premier was going to be nailed today for non-compliance and it is here for that reason .
it is the responsibility of local government to zone the land , but from my personal point of view , i would say , no .
all applications received are scrutinised on a weekly basis by an internal staff committee , chaired by the director : cultural and heritage of the chief directorate : cultural affairs , and during these meetings the applications are scrutinised to ensure that they contain all the required information .
( ii ) there are no litigation costs to date , except for the consulting commercial lawyer 's costs of approximately r52 000 .
we are running out of time and i will allow only two follow-up questions from now on so that we can finish with the question paper .
this is a reasonable request so that we can enable those hon members to appear in the ncop .
my question to the hon premier is : what has he as premier done to alleviate these problems in our province ?
no , i do not have a good gambling memory like the hon member has , because i do not remember all the numbers .
the hon member should not ask me to agree to something that i have not seen in writing .
his problem is that he blows hot and cold - first he has powers , then he has no powers .
when one listens to the stories one hears on the cape flats , the hon minister is a big consultant .
women on the cape flats are entitled to be treated in the same way as women in bishopscourt and constantia .
he deliberately mislead the house by saying that i did not issue a statement about the thabo mabaso incident .
mr speaker , i am very confused by this answer , because at the time the agreement was made between ...
should there be a need to change this approach , the matter could be taken up with the saps at national level .
it was a good deed from our side - it was not something that we had to do .
i do not want to go into the details , but it is exactly what the hon member mr isaacs said now .
they are manning police stations because we do not have enough policemen and women in this province to do the work .
( d ) the farm owner made arrangements for a woman on the farm to prepare food for mr mcotshana .
mr speaker , a year ago , the anc had exposed the lack of representivity in the public service at the senior management echelon .
the hon premier goes on public record as saying that there are no competent blacks and that they are searching for competent blacks .
mr speaker , he said that they are going to head-hunt for competent blacks , but competent blacks come and they leave .
what steps are taken to ensure peace in the public transport sector in the cape metropole and to prevent unnecessary violence ?
on 3 august this year all taxi ranks , taxi routes and other public transport in khayelitsha were closed for a period of 24 hours .
is that hon minister over there the minister of transport , or is the hon member mr meyer the minister of transport ?
this is exactly the same as what happened with previous ministers who liked to get into transport issues .
] when that principle was established and we said that we would move in , we had excellent cooperation from all sides .
mr speaker , i can table the list for the hon member mr lewis or i can read it out .
a big debate and a great deal of pressure eventually resulted in that school , and that school is ...
i wrote to the circuit manager and asked him to go to the schools there and talk to them .
could the hon minister explain the excessive delay which is costing people millions and millions of rand in implementing these regulations .
i must make it clear that the planning legislation , western cape planning and development act , act 7 of 1999 , is not unconstitutional .
the hon member mr fransman was there with me and he is on the photograph taken there .
in terms of the constitution of the republic of south africa , that person can make a complaint to me , after which it will be investigated .
yes , in nominal terms there is an increase year on year , but in real terms there is not . when one considers-
the two major constraints we have to deal with are the high cost of the prostheses and the limited operating time that is available .
the intention was not to complete the implementation of all of these initiatives in 100 days , but in my term of office .
we have strengthened management , appointed a business manager and have made progress in appointing chief executive officers to our hospitals .
this practice has , in the meantime , fallen away , and an opinion had to be obtained before an absolutely final amount could be submitted .
( 2 ) what is the property portfolio with regard to the 700 properties that are registered in the province 's name ;
it was on the minmec agenda but the national minister removed it from the agenda because the matter is sub judice .
there is no preference procurement system here and we challenge the province to look at the rest of the country .
it does not instruct any organ of state that they should wait for regulations before they draw up their own preferential procurement system .
there , there is not a single contract that will go through without being scrutinised for its black empowerment component .
mr speaker , unfortunately i do not know off the cuff what the ratio is ; i will have to establish that .
vacancies have been advertised and recruitment interviews conducted with pharmacists , and if suitable candidates are identified appointments will already be made this month .
the impairment may be of a physical , mental , sensory , learning or psychiatric nature which is medically certified .
various visits to the different regions took place in partnership with the department of social services on the integrated provincial disability strategy .
if the hon member mr dugmore would like to ask a question he should ask the speaker if he may do so .
development of a best practice model for the monitoring , evaluation and reporting of the integrated provincial disability strategy is currently in the tender process .
mr speaker , it would be very difficult to give a breakdown of cost per health facility off the cuff .
additional security equipment has been installed at head office in order to create a still safer environment for the handling of examination papers and scripts .
mr speaker , is the hon member asking the question or the hon leader of the opposition ?
the chrysalis project was on the go when the former minister of community safety , sport and recreation was still in office .
mr speaker , when i last spoke to the former minister of community safety , sport and recreation he was involved there .
we have shown that equity and excellence can go hand in hand , and that empowerment can lead to better government .
thus , the promotion of tourism is one of two key ways in which to drive the development of the provincial economy .
we are determined to ensure the success of our recently launched export development programme with the chamber of commerce and industry here in cape town .
the decision to establish an interests office was preceded by thorough research and the development of relations with various regions of europe .
the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs will lead the clean-up campaign , but we require the participation of responsible , concerned citizens .
it is therefore not surprising that the past year has seen major new investment projects and infrastructure come on stream .
we must ask the departments to bring this matter of roll-over funds to a head , so that these funds do not keep on being rolled over .
as far as vote 5 - education is concerned , i cannot understand the fact that education personnel spent only two minutes in the scof meeting .
as we know , the dp pushed very hard for provision to be made in the constitution for an environmental commissioner .
mr speaker , i wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the hon premier on his 60th birthday .
mr speaker , any analysis of the vote that we are involved with today must take into account two particular issues .
r37 million is a very large amount of money , and i hope that this issue will be clarified over the next while .
one of the conditions on which we paid it was that there would be no interest paid on the consultants figures .
this is our clear action plan toward achieving our 2020 vision , which closely follows our nine policy objectives in letter and in spirit .
i listened to the comments of the hon leader of the opposition , but the anc are obviously in disarray .
mr speaker , it is unheard of in any modern democracy , except perhaps in anc circles , for voting to be done by stealth .
has the hon member mr strachan told his children about the millions of people who died of starvation under communism ?
has he forgotten the meeting that he and i had with madiba three days after i was elected as premier ?
i hope that the cape argus will print my reply to that letter which i will not read to the house .
i feel that you therefore have the power in terms of rule 1 to make a ruling in respect of eventualities which do arise .
the closed dewatering process is enjoying attention ; the inlet sieves have been replaced ; and the capacity of the biological reactor has been increased as an interim measure .
the capacity at zandvliet is adequate at this stage , and we do not believe that the black mack will be used .
mr speaker , the hon member mr mckenzie referred to promises made by the cmc and by members .
( 1 ) what is the total estimated cost to the province of school vandalism for the period january to december 1999 ;
the western cape education department spent about r3,2 million on its major unscheduled maintenance programme during the period january to december 1999 .
in trying to prevent vandalism and violence at our schools we put it up to r15 million last year .
however , i am worried about the actions of the hon member mr mckenzie in that he has been having meetings with the cpos .
( 1 ) 392 have left the service this last year due to retirements , medical boarding , discharges and deaths .
( 1 ) what progress has been made with the formulation of a policy framework and criteria for the sale of provincial assets ;
as they will remember , the hon minister and the province have monitoring and oversight powers which they use very well .
i would like to draw hon members ' attention to one of my major concerns for this province .
the total estimated expenditure on this project will amount to r234 million over six years and includes infrastructure requirements , exchange rates and maintenance costs .
a special word of thanks to dr j c stegmann and his team finance for a job very well done .
madam chairperson , not long ago south africa regained its rightful place in the united nations and the family of nations .
i love my country , i love the people in it and until the day i die i want to be a south african .
] it is not just a national competency , but the way in which it is framed there refers to it as a national competency .
that is not to say that the tender board cannot do that under all circumstances , but it is cause for grave disquiet .
i think , in this regard , that the maxim about letting the managers manage , but holding them accountable , represents an outstanding principle .
i find words about poverty relief being used without proper budgetary support , and this , of course , is not pragmatic .
we were informed that the director-general had indicated that the department was not progressing because people wanted to apply affirmative action .
the way in which this department , with the hon minister of finance and development planning at its head , manages its budgetary responsibilities impressively is noteworthy .
it is important for the western cape , however , that we now also have the opportunity to promote capacity-building in the financial training programmes .
we generally check from here whether or not we have a quorum , and we have sustained a quorum throughout the sitting .
the hon minister was quite right when he said that we already had a problem with illegal gambling in this province .
despite the exceptionally difficult circumstances that they work under , commissioner max and his staff have produced service of the highest calibre .
the four phases of the course will be basic training and orientation , leadership training in a wilderness experience , skills training and community work and voluntarism .
today it is already at the level at which we adopt the aaa approach , and certain former ministers never even dreamt of that .
this is a headline and the opening lines , in the life and times of the dp and new np coalition in the western cape .
of course , one of the problems with community patrol officers is the fact that they are often probably more highly educated than normal police officers in police stations .
i believe , mr chairperson , that the other side of the house will join the new np in expressing the strongest condemnation of that .
these are quite disturbing figures , especially if one takes into account the fact that 21 police stations close at 16 : 00 .
we are pleased to hear that the saps are holding workshops with the elderly and are helping them with self-defence and empowerment programmes .
on monday the hon premier made an appeal to the people of the western cape when he said , and i quote :
madam chairperson , after my discussion with the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation i saw a different mark wiley .
it will also provide them with opportunities to be positive role models , and provide these young adults with an intensive personal growth experience .
the person who went to work in oudtshoorn after him , area commissioner japhta , can say that he is standing in a big man 's shoes .
do not hold me accountable for transformation in the police when it is the responsibility of sydney mufamadi and steve tshwete .
it is totally unacceptable and i am afraid it is yet another legacy of a budget that has been underfunding the criminal justice system .
the next time an hon member makes a paragraph of interjections , i am going to have to remove that member from the house .
this programme was backed by regular monthly sport activities , also known as community games , in these communities during the period between school holidays .
this particular programme affected 6 000 young people who participated , and the cost to the department was r50 000 .
they are the western cape education department , the united schools sport association of south africa , known as ussasa , and the western cape department of sport and recreation .
ussasa benefits to the amount of r100 000 per annum from the department , which we give to them to run their affairs .
secondly , ussasa is responsible for organising school sport leagues and competitions , while the yeoman work is done by a dedicated band of teachers .
for example , i call to mind the international success achieved this morning by herschelle gibbs when he scored a fine century ...
they are the thousands of faceless officials who devote hours of their leisure time to ensuring that our clubs and federations continue to exist .
i also wish to convey my thanks and appreciation to the many teachers who make great sacrifices in the coaching of children .
i can already see the hon leader of the opposition with a cricket bat helping to coach the pupils for the cricket minute .
" , in this house while our children are still playing on dark fields while theirs are playing under floodlights on green grass surfaces .
one of key outcomes of the gold book is to increase sporting tourism to this province by hosting major events .
mr chairperson , i just want to mention that gary kirsten also scored a century in this morning 's one-day international match against india .
madam chairperson , i would like to agree with the previous speaker that sport is one of the greatest contributory factors towards nation-building .
i commend them for the work that they are doing and ask all hon members of the house to support their efforts .
the r600 000 that we have given to rural sport facilities is just supplementary to the municipalities ' establishing the basic infrastructure .
the hon member mr stali also mentioned women in sport , and so did the hon member ms mqulwana .
] i think we are the only province to have become involved with an organisation called wassa , which is women in sport .
there will also be four practice venues , of which athlone is one , and i think there are venues in the strand , green point and stellenbosch .
i too am part of the majority of people president mbeki referred to on friday , who are proud to be south africans .
last week , the provincial cabinet firmly supported the country 's bid to host the 2006 world cup soccer series .
the proudest people are not those who necessarily have the best of everything , but those who make the best of everything .
this is in line with one of our nine policy objectives : preparing the people for the knowledge economy of the 21st century .
people who cannot afford to pay for id photographs will nevertheless be helped to obtain them .
as hon members are probably aware , i visited the german state of bavaria , as well as upper austria and france , in november and december last year .
organisations like the aa and every recognised , registered garage should be equipped to make vehicles roadworthy and issue roadworthy certificates .
we also have a kaleidoscope of differing religions and philosophies , the predominant being christian , islamic , jewish and african traditional .
the national minister of safety and security already wants to change the constitution and i do not doubt that his motives are honourable .
it believes that the people should elect their leaders - not the leaders elect the representatives of the people .
mr speaker , the details are set out in the schedules to the bill and i would therefore like to move the first reading .
others are probably amongst the weakest in the world , although we have no official benchmarks to establish this objectively .
we must look very seriously at how we establish a culture of personal responsibility and accountability as the foundation of our education system .
i would like to tell the hon member mr dugmore that the whole of sadtu were very helpful - unlike the anc .
an examination that determines exit standards is necessary in every education system , and we support its retention as a very important educational yardstick .
in this regard i must make particular mention of the excellent examinations department in the wced headed by mr andr clausen .
mr chairperson , within this project we have established a special focus on mathematics , science and technology , with particular emphasis on grade 7 .
mr chairperson , our fourth priority and critical success factor is creating school environments that are safe for our teachers and learners .
however , we must also remember that for every rand we spend on security , we spend r1 less on other crucial education projects .
with the aid of , inter alia , school clinics , pupils will develop the necessary knowledge , skills and values that are essential for acceptable behaviour .
there is one view that argues in favour of rapid change in education , and curriculum 2005 is an example of that view .
the argument is that slow incremental change may result in the stakeholders regressing to the old way of doing things .
the principal noticed that some of the stamps were missing and immediately surmised that there would be some falsified reports .
proportionately south africa invests more in education than most countries in the world , according to unesco 's comparative statistics for developing countries .
i must also add that while visiting schools in the southern cape , i was most impressed by the percy mdlala high school .
with dedication like this from the staff and the community , the school will surely produce excellence for the province and the country .
in the previous political dispensation education was used to marginalise communities and generations and to destroy them , as it were .
i do not want us to transform education and in the process destroy education , as is happening elsewhere .
madam chairperson , the most important challenge is to support all our schools , at whatever stage of development they are .
it takes the teacher 10 minutes to sort out the class before he or she can begin the lesson .
i certainly went to bishop lavis , thanks to the hon member mr n m isaacs , and went from school to school there .
my commitment is to using the budgetary allocation available to us to make that vision a reality in the next few years .
we have budgeted r43 million for this purpose , and the hon minister of local government will be glad to hear that .
part of spending more wisely also means beginning to address the enormous backlog of medical equipment .
the equipment allocation has therefore increased to r50 million , which is the largest equipment allocation within health for the last five years .
it happens with the district surgeons and with the staff who are sometimes overworked and tired , but it ought not to happen .
then there is the report from the national department concerning pilot projects to test pupils for hiv / aids at several schools .
madam chairperson , there is no indication in the allocation of which aspects , if any , of the tb programme will be enhanced .
the incidence as measured during 1997 alone was 496 per 100 000 people and about 600 per 100 000 people during 1999 .
some of this results from the untouchability of the academic teaching at tertiary hospitals , and i can give some examples .
the fact that these statistics are still current indicates that , in fact , we are delivering a high quality of service with a reduced staff component .
i am not sure how it should be dealt with , but i plead with the hon minister to privatise those hospitals .
since 1995 the western cape health department has reduced its staff by 9 007 and hospital beds were reduced by 3 628 .
i feel that to some extent the hon minister of health has missed what his budget speech ought to be .
it was not possible to get private paying patients into our hospitals because they were really not saleable commodities .
i think the hon leader of the opposition was very unfair to judge us , his former department , according to that .
the unfortunate thing is that the bulk of injuries are self-inflicted and alcohol abuse is also a major contributor to trauma problems .
madam chairperson , it is quite clear that malaysia has done the hon member ms essop some good .
the district offices render services to our customers at grassroots level , either through the offices themselves or through a network of service points in the community .
at this stage we have the missing-file syndrome in that branch and we really want to address that concern .
it was also mentioned that the welfare projects in crossroads and in bekkersdal in gauteng are among the most successful in south africa .
this is a very serious concern and i hope that it will be addressed in the house in the future .
madam chairperson , thank you very much for the opportunity to discuss a very important matter today , namely poverty relief in the western cape .
i regard this as totally unacceptable when we speak about cooperating on a collective basis at both the national and the provincial levels to combat poverty .
the point of departure of my office is that poverty relief is a function that ought to be addressed by all departments , individually and collectively .
mr chairperson , we must tell ourselves honestly that there is no simple solution to the endemic tragedy of poverty .
these are children who have for example done woodwork up to std 8 or matric level who can be involved in a kind of project .
a policy document for the western cape was compiled in 1997 , in collaboration with all major stakeholders in the field of hiv / aids .
this flies in the face of those hon members ' belief that black people and women could not do the job .
after the carte blanche programme , the hon premier of the province declared abuse of the aged as one of the bad apples .
i say again , it cannot be only a welfare problem - it must , for instance , also be the problem of the police .
while i believe in accountability and responsibility , i also believe that people in glass houses should not throw stones .
she then went on to say that the departments would be obliged to work on disaggregated data on the matter .
we should also challenge the national government on phasing out the maintenance grant for children up to the age of 18 years .
this was replaced by a child support grant as from 1 april 1994 , but to date only 6 377 such grants have been issued .
mr speaker , i move without notice : that the house congratulates the national cricket team on their exciting win against india this morning .
the 2001-02 financial year will see a further reduction to r316 million and in the 2002-03 financial year we will only receive r263 million .
at national level , the western cape also received recognition when the construction consortium delftcon was chosen as the best up-and-coming builder in south africa .
i am , therefore , confident that the western cape housing development board will be able to look after the needs of all the communities in the province .
communication of the department of corporate services , is in the process of launching an information campaign which will kick off in the little karoo district .
perhaps we should do as the old folk song says , and go " marching to pretoria " , in order to strengthen our cause .
i have already referred to the communication and information campaign due to begin very soon , and to the capacity-building programmes , some of which are already under way .
] that hon member parted his hair too forcefully this morning , and that is why he is sitting there talking so loudly .
madam chairperson , there is a saying that goes : " show me your friends and i can tell you who you are .
i want to ask the hon minister to ensure that when we talk about integration , we do not base that integration solely on skin colour .
i am appealing to the hon minister on behalf of my people there on the flats - those in steenberg and across to the other side of the hottentots-holland mountains .
these are new np-controlled councils and that is why , we believe , the hon minister is failing the poor .
he then wants to sell non-residential land at market value without first asking whether that land could , in fact , be used for housing .
housing development also serves as an engine for economic growth by providing potential business opportunities to the private sector and employment opportunities for the poor .
now , although hon members are trying to take heed of that , i must say that it is very difficult to hear the debate from the chair .
the point here is that there are people who are using the opportunity to benefit themselves while the process is disorganised .
i thank the hon minister that he accept the fact that farm workers make an enormous contribution towards the economy of the western cape .
numerous excuses are offered , of which the best known is the fact that people are in arrears with the payment of their rent and service fees .
the funds that we receive from the central government put us in a position to build only 22 000 houses per year .
this developer owes the western cape provincial housing development board over r1 million for houses that were never built in crossroads and ktc .
i challenge him - my learned friend - to take those sections and test them with mr justice chaskalson .
i would like to thank the officials present here today , namely messrs africa and naud , and the rest of the team .
i think we should recognise this and see how we can give the necessary support in order to achieve financial or project viability .
we saw this in manenberg , when those hon members flew at some of their ministers , so they know what i am talking about .
i am not going to refer in detail to the local government : municipal structures act , 1998 ( act 117 of 1998 ) .
it was decided , in the course of a process of consultation between the national minister and the nine provincial ministers , that by-elections should be postponed .
on the other hand , there is the voters ' roll of 2 june 1999 , which is to be used , but adjusted for the municipal elections .
another condition that i communicated to the unicity commission is that the name cape town / kaapstad should be retained .
we will have to take these into account when we look at the division of functions between our district municipalities and our local municipalities .
that is also critical - whether it is 4 % or 5 % - in order to protect the integrity of municipalities .
i am only elaborating on some very important things , and telling the anc where the problem lies .
every single rand of the tens of millions of rand that he mentioned today comes from the national government through the hon minister .
the hon minister said in september 1999 , " it is my passion , " and , " it is my greatest challenge .
the fundamental question is whether this is possible or desirable , given the huge size of a country like south africa and its diversity .
it is essential that labour come on board during the transitional phase with as much enthusiasm and commitment as all the other stakeholders .
given the election pressures that we are all starting to feel even now , a more inclusive and non-party political attitude will be needed in these negotiations .
i give the hon minister of local government the assurance that i do not mean this as a personal attack on him .
i do not want the hon minister to have to try to defend himself today , because i wanted to spare him that pain .
madam chairperson , in south africa and in the western cape , local government is in the process of undergoing the most comprehensive and far-reaching transformation .
they do have one representative for the unicity , and i hope and trust that they will not bring that attitude through .
the dawning of the unicity will hopefully serve as an economic equaliser between the haves and the have-nots .
it remains an untested system , but it is at least a system which will hopefully equalise the inequality that there has been in service delivery .
madam chairperson , i gladly take part in this very important debate - this is where the rubber hits the road !
i must thank the hon members of the anc , with the exception of one hon member who acted rather clownishly .
yes , the hon member is correct , that legislation is not yet on the table and we find ourselves in a dilemma .
i am coming to the next point , and i want to respond specifically to certain aspects that the hon member mr mckenzie mentioned .
i referred to one municipality . i did not refer to a single municipality currently being governed by the new np or the dp .
i am sorry to have to put it so baldly , and i am not addressing this personally to those hon members or to their parties .
i do not want to put it too favourably , because then it might start sounding as if i agree completely with what the anc says there .
hon members also know that the house looks at the realities of south africa , and that is why he mentioned his realistic aspirations here today .
kogelberg was declared the first such biosphere reserve in south africa , and the cape west coast reserve was submitted to unesco in november last year .
that organisation started its process of application evaluation during january this year , and the outcome can be expected in august or september of this year .
the next challenge i want to discuss is how to ensure public participation , especially by the more marginalised communities , in planning processes .
in terms of the national constitution , provincial planning is an exclusive provincial function , and in the western cape this has been entrusted to the chief directorate : development planning .
simultaneously we are running a campaign to inform the general public , and that started on 7 february this year .
finally , i wish to inform this parliament of a decision that i and the cabinet committee have made concerning the contentious dassenberg development in noordhoek .
the second one , which i think the hon minister needs to take very seriously , is the issue of the metropolitan spatial development framework .
these biospheres are , as the hon minister has said , registered with the un educational scientific and cultural organisation ( unesco ) .
i believe consultation is one of the most critical elements in good development planning and that consultation should bring on board as many role-players as possible .
we have african representation numbering 23 individuals , asian representation numbering 4 and coloured representation numbering 426 .
the challenge to the hon minister is that he must address , in his transformation plans for his department , the work environment itself .
what amazes me is that the development facilitation act provides for opportunities for planning for residential areas , as well as small-scale farmers .
i would like first to respond to some points that the hon member mr louis made about dassenberg .
also , he needs to look practically at how civil society is going to get involved in drawing up the development framework for the province .
madam chairperson , i want to go into the question that the chairperson raised regarding local governments dealing with planning .
our approach to environmental affairs must have as a central reference point the environmental right in section 24 in the bill of rights in our constitution .
the emphasis in cultural affairs , with a budget of r70,564 million , is delivery of services directly to the people of the western cape .
the western cape language committee commenced operations in 1999 and was also appointed through an open and democratic process .
we shall also assist ad hoc initiatives of merit proposed by community cultural organisations , celebrations of significance to the province and major cultural events .
in so doing , the expenditure related to aids-related programmes is therefore similarly embedded in the budget allocation of the environmental and cultural programmes themselves .
the hon minister spoke about searching for a permanent solution for the future of the performing arts in the western cape .
i would like to congratulate dr hein willemse and his team on the success of the past year , during which the language commission was established .
in that environmental management policy document there was consensus that environmental education was no longer a subject to be confined to institutions only .
perhaps it is because the hon minister used to be a member of the anc and was offered a high-flying position in the dp .
what i found tragic on that occasion , however , was that so few people know about this important cultural heritage of the community .
i am going to speak about culture as a way of life for us as south africans as we try to transform ourselves into a rainbow nation .
madam chairperson , i was greeted this morning at the entrance to the provincial parliament by a new black face - a woman .
madam chairperson , finally i wish the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs and the new western cape nature conservation board everything of the best .
i then tried to figure out exactly what this particular organisation was doing , and i discovered that a lingerie workshop was also funded .
i serve on the board , but i did not attend the last meeting , which was the hon member 's first meeting .
madam chairperson , there was one more question that the hon member mr lewis raised , and that related to libraries .
in regard to the hon member 's concern about the money allocated to brown issues , i agree with him entirely .
i would not advise the province to become involved , unless the national department delegates the function with the funds as well .
i agree with her entirely that one should be looking at where the funds are going in terms of our ad hoc budgets .
in the past hon members on both sides of the house have accused one another of acting in terms of certain policies .
the hon member mr mckenzie made such a fuss that no one could even hear what he had to say .
we are fortunate that at this time the extremely dry climatic conditions are helping to extend the life of our rather aged road infrastructure .
other provincial transport legislation in the course of preparation includes the road management bill , the transport regulation bill and the transport planning bill .
as far as transport authorities are concerned , work is well under way in the cape metropolitan area in investigating the establishment of the metropolitan transport authority .
the contracts for the repair of the flood damage in meiringspoort are under way and those of uniondalepoort and caledon are virtually completed .
a contract of more than r2 million for the repair of the chapmans peak pass has also been funded by the department of transport .
i should also like to thank mr roy petersen for the part he has played in making sure that the people on our roads travel safely .
from my heart i would like to say that they have done well done and thank them for the work they do .
firstly , there is transformation ; secondly , development and implementation of an accommodation programme ; thirdly , building and maintenance ; and lastly , the merlin system .
the standing committee on economic development would like to receive the completion of the accommodation model , to ensure the optimal utilisation of provincial buildings .
madam chairperson , this morning between 05 : 00 and 05 : 30 i was travelling on the worcester-robertson road and no fewer than ...
i want to extend my sincere thanks to the hon minister of transport and works , mr petersen , and the other officials of the department of transport .
this is the piece of road on which most rapid progress can be made because there are no really expensive bridges on the road .
apartheid has left the majority of the population in poverty , with little access to employment , education , better basic services and the like .
the critical question that faces all of us is how we can use the budget to turn the situation around .
during the period up to 1997 the western cape generated 1,36 million work days , or 5 222 person years as a result of the public works programmes .
it is a matter of record that the budget of r428,169 million for transport and r227,173 million for works will deal with this issue .
however , i would like to propose that we deal with the matter of restructuring and reorganisation of the minibus taxi industry as an administrative issue .
i want to ask the national government whether they are going to send us almost a million wheel clamps to start immobilising cars .
we referred to section 79 ( 1 ) of the constitution of the republic of south africa , 1996 , which reads as follows :
a points system may now be introduced with which they can catch you when you go to buy a new licence .
i have now been informed by the hon minister that we are going to have an increase of 25 % in motor car licence fees .
the anc thinks that a minimum of even 30 % could be built into the tender documents for the pdis , without difficulty .
in the west coast district council region 63 % of these gravel roads have been classified as poor to very poor , as against 37 % in the western cape .
the hon minister and i went to call on these people on a saturday afternoon when the stormers were still doing a little better .
sir , the chief executive officer remarked playfully at that meeting that they had graded the road for these prominent guests .
however , there is one dark spot in the budget report before us , and that is that the licensing fees will be increased by 25 % .
i do not think we should be too quick to get excited about the other provinces that have thus far not increased their licence fees .
the hon member mr mckenzie knows , after all , that we cannot at will increase the salaries of the officials in a provincial department .
with the transformation of local authorities and the merging of the little karoo and the south cape district councils , the traffic will increase even more drastically .
they are in connection with the hiring of vehicles with drivers for the transportation of personnel to and from the airport , a shuttle service .
the hon minister can correct me if i am wrong about the following , as i would like the correct information .
it may still happen in the second or third half of 2001 if we do not devote serious attention to it now .
if we had got a different company to build the casino , we could have achieved a lot in the city centre .
we also decided to use the mtef allocation to advance the work on the second part of the road by a year .
( b ) the reasons are due to financial difficulties , failing to produce guarantees and failing to perform in accordance with contract conditions .
madam chairperson , i am replying to the hon member mr ramatlakane and not to that hon member .
account will be given of every cent spent on poverty relief , because that money was allocated under the budget .
mr schwabe must please inform him that we in this house thanked him for the work he did there .
it is suspected that someone threw a cigarette butts out of the window of a moving vehicle , thus causing the fire .
however i can already assure her that those problems do not lie with the departments of transport or of works .
in this case there is a danger that the wording is not clear and accordingly the motion cannot be submitted immediately .
if they do not do that , they run the risk that the house will not be able to attend to the motion immediately .
we must clarify one point for once and for all , a point which in my opinion many hon members have no understanding of .
the members are c b herandien ( chairperson ) , r j king , l ramatlakane , n m isaacs , d silke and r williams .
given that i moved that motion first , i want to ask you whether the motion of the hon member mr silke should stand .
madam chairperson , i would firstly like to thank the chairperson of the standing committee on economic development and the members of the committee .
finally , during the last decade or so the world economy has undergone huge structural change , driven by new technologies and new markets .
madam chairperson , i believe that in many regards we are well suited to meet the challenges of the knowledge economy .
they have a close development orientated relationship with subcontractors , thereby contributing to the learning and competence development within our own companies in the western cape .
the marketing activities of such an agency will also facilitate the entry of products from lesser known areas and townships into the mainstream tourism market .
on the one hand the bulk of the liquor industry producers - in fact , about 90 % - in the liquor industry in south africa operate in this province .
tourism themes , contained in material developed by the tourism education trust , are woven into the rest of the children 's curriculum .
the multiplier effects of these investments are likely to result in at least 1 % value being added to our gross regional product .
madam chairperson , the economic green paper will address the future role of wesgro along the lines that i have already set out above .
madam chairperson , the department continues to render consumer advice services directly to members of the public , and also indirectly through agent organisations .
they would pay a 12 % tax rate , capped for five years , if they created employment for more than 200 people , for example .
as a businessperson , i think taxation is a critical element , and this brings me to the new capital gains tax that has just come in .
now , since then , the provincial government has not kept to this financial plan , and yet we have expected the same level of delivery .
we are saying that we want wesgro to fulfil the capacity of some critical institutional gaps , particularly around economic data and technological development .
yet we are saying that by october we want to produce 8 000 to 10 000 applications for section 28 ( 1 ) certificates .
we , too , wish to thank the hon minister for the leadership and vision he is displaying in the department in regard to business promotion .
such an industrial programme must make provision for incentive measures in line with the particular characteristics of each industrial sector so that each industry can develop to its full potential .
it is gratifying that the hon minister also said this morning that they must be considered in future in the financial sphere .
madam chairperson , wesgro , whom the hon minister correctly congratulated , receives under half of its funding from the province .
] we know that , and we listened to it when the hon minister was not here and we agree with it .
i commend all of them on these initiatives , and i am sure it is the culmination of many months of hard work .
madam chairperson , another policy that the hon minister will be working on is the developing and administering policy regarding business regulations in the province .
if this was a factory , the unions would have had the management before an industrial court for exceeding the laid down noise pollution levels .
the owners of the establishment know that if they contravene the curfew , the local residents will have them shut down immediately .
to illustrate my point i want to refer to the accommodation guide which the hon minister so kindly placed in our packets .
the responsibility is to achieve this objective whilst retaining the jewel on which the opportunity is based - the natural environment .
foreign investments cluster around the larger hotel projects , some of the megaprojects and infrastructure developments , and international franchise-linked investments .
average expenditure for a trip to the western cape by domestic visitors was r189 per day , 36 % more than the national average .
i do believe very seriously that the hon minister must do something about increasing the amount that this province contributes to wesgro .
it is a key sector , and the hon minister cannot be blind to it in his overall economic vision for the province .
] i want to announce that the anc will proactively be taking the initiative to host an alliance summit on job creation and job security very shortly .
what it proves is that the more one reveals about what one is doing , the more one can have debates of this type .
let us deal with the issue of black empowerment , as empowerment is one of the most important issues facing this country .
if we had implemented that bill , every single licence allocated by the western cape liquor board would have been assailable in a court of law .
i will not apologise for it , because i was not prepared to have the liquor industry in this province disrupted .
in the longer term this leads to downward pressure on the prices of agricultural commodities , which is usually made less obvious by short-term fluctuations in agricultural prices .
the aim of the legislation is to develop an enabling and voluntary framework for agriculturists with which they can differentiate their products .
next month the cabinet will take a decision on the allocation of r3 million towards the investigation of further scenarios .
the importance of this scheme lies in its enormous job creation potential for affected rural people and the settlement of new farmers .
this is a very innovative way of using the market trends of the 21st century to promote job creation in agriculture .
at present it is expected of the tobacco industry to reduce tar and nicotine levels to 12 mg within the next two years .
there is no doubt that time and money should be invested in developing a risk management strategy for agriculture in the western cape .
farmers must have a clear understanding that their financial survival is dependent on the ability to be the first to adopt cost-reducing technology .
our role as provincial government is , firstly , to provide an effective research and extension service through the development of a western cape agricultural development service .
the most obvious part of the solution would lie in the developing of alternative uses of resources - natural , capital and human .
where there are alternative areas for wheat production , can the combine harvesters not be swapped to maximise the use of higher technology ?
this would especially be of benefit if it fell into the programme of regionalisation that the hon premier is ardently committed to following .
a year ago there was no form of cultivation of this piece of land , now it looks totally different .
accordingly i appeal to the hon minister of housing to put the housing policy of the western cape in place soon .
why should farmers still be planting stein grapes when there is a disproportionate production of white and red wine and the white wine prices are falling ?
how many of the textile industries are closed today because we did not give the necessary protection to our local markets and factories ?
is it not possible to operate on a broader scale to increase the adding of value in regard to tourism ?
bokkie plaatjies is now about approximately 36 years old , her parents are , like her , farm workers - good , hardworking , god-fearing people , bokkie would say .
i want them to answer this question for themselves : if their income were to drop by 50 % , would they come out ?
we in our province must also look for state land on which we can settle new farmers , and i should like to do so .
i do think that with industries such as agri-tourism and job creation and new agri-industries on farms , we shall be empowering women as well .
at this stage the new farmers comprise a mere 10 % , but 30 % of the budget is being spent on them .
hon members have objected to vote 1 in its entirety because they have a problem with one area in that vote .
( 2 ) requests the south african government to immediately attempt to resolve the situation in a peaceful manner through diplomatic intervention ; and
i too am part of the majority of people president mbeki referred to on friday , who are proud to be south africans .
last week , the provincial cabinet firmly supported the country 's bid to host the 2006 world cup soccer series .
the proudest people are not those who necessarily have the best of everything , but those who make the best of everything .
this is in line with one of our nine policy objectives : preparing the people for the knowledge economy of the 21st century .
people who cannot afford to pay for id photographs will nevertheless be helped to obtain them .
as hon members are probably aware , i visited the german state of bavaria , as well as upper austria and france , in november and december last year .
organisations like the aa and every recognised , registered garage should be equipped to make vehicles roadworthy and issue roadworthy certificates .
we also have a kaleidoscope of differing religions and philosophies , the predominant being christian , islamic , jewish and african traditional .
the national minister of safety and security already wants to change the constitution and i do not doubt that his motives are honourable .
it believes that the people should elect their leaders - not the leaders elect the representatives of the people .
specific targeted providers of transport are now being prevented and restricted from providing this service to employees , school-going children and the community .
we administer these contracts and we cannot permit the contractors to be prevented from carrying out their contractual obligations .
this type of legislation has been passed in other provinces , and that shows that they have already taken the course that we are taking .
we are going to expand it to " any authorized officer " and that is how the amendment was accepted by the standing committee .
mr speaker , it has been exactly 51 days since the dispute arose between the taxi and the bus operators on routes and permit issues .
we have tabled the solution document and the hon minister has indicated that he has no problem with the thrust of it .
not a single person from the government visited the family of mr ganuganu or even sent a message of support .
from what i have heard from the hon member mr dugmore , it is clear that he has not gone through the act .
if he had gone through the act , he would have seen that there are ample ways and means to deal with the situation .
i agree with the hon member mr louis that this amendment should not be seen in isolation to the principal act .
yes , we must consider the rights of the taxi owners , and the rights of the community , the bus company and other operators .
i want to thank the hon member mr winde for his support and for the wonderful contribution he made in committee .
i want to add that the people who violate that right should also understand what " the rights of our people " mean .
i am also grateful that he also referred to the 51 days that have passed - i have already dealt with that .
no wonder kleinvlei is still not as well equipped as kuils river , ravensmead and parow and manenberg and sea point .
we were deputised by the then bishop lavis police , and we dealt with criminals harshly when we got them on the streets .
our obsession with fairness in the post-apartheid era has ironically tipped the scales in favour of criminals at the expense of the rest .
] the courts gave an interpretation of that clause to mean that one cannot take a murderer 's life .
the majority of the policemen and women are people of integrity but we must always reinforce that perception from our side .
he then mentioned the wouter bassons , and he attacked and he spoke about his ears and he attacked the coalition .
" i am speaking for the motion of the hon member mr byneveldt , and he is a man of the church .
mr speaker , the last speaker asked whether the minister had the power to contain crime in the province .
] unfortunately , i do not pay the police nor do i appoint them , but that is not the point .
two or three times a week the anc or its front organisations are engaged in strikes and marches , as they are of course constitutionally entitled to do .
can they not understand that every time they do that , the police have to be there to guide the marches ?
we had a debate on that matter in the house , and there is a motion on this matter on the order paper .
i find it logical that the people who served at these service points did not all have their own transport .
hon members will recall the registrations that were done with the " zib-zib guns " which sometimes lay around everywhere .
mr speaker , when the hon member mr ismail attempts to present logic to this house i become very worried .
mr speaker , the hon member mr ozinsky has provided us with an oxford definition of " volunteer " - what it means .
this is the only province that could not mobilise its public servants to do voluntary work during voter registration for democracy .
perhaps it is because they are now in bed with that great fighter for democracy , accountability and transparency , lucas mangope ...
we should call for a full hearing in scof , at which the iec officials and others are called to give evidence .
for understandable reasons the anc voted against the finance bill in committee - the answers did not satisfy them politically .
] in terms of the constitution , chapter 2 , section 19 ( 2 ) , as pointed out by " mr bean " ...
it seems to me as if the anc of the western cape is criticising the request which the western cape received from the central government .
mr speaker , yesterday at the meeting of the standing committee i tried to get a picture of the background of the bill that has been tabled .
mr speaker , it is simply not true that the government asked the province to pay volunteers for voter registration .
in fact , no public servants were paid for the first voter registration weekend , which was in december 1998 , or the second weekend , in february 1999 .
the hon member mr ozinsky then told us that at first there were 430 volunteers , but who were those 430 volunteers ?
i wish to state bluntly that what the director-general did was done to get voters to the polls .
i am glad the hon member is off the dp and onto the new np ; we need the publicity .
the hon member mr lewis did not realise that if he wanted to abstain from voting , he had to leave the house .
madam chairperson , with reference to the question that the hon member ms essop asked , what time allocation is allowed for questions ?
i am considering adjourning the house for two minutes in order to consult the speaker in this regard .
to put it in simple language , what we have here is money that we required to pool together in order to deal with iec registration .
if the hon member is prepared to put his question in writing , i will provide the details that he has requested .
the other process is that hon members can ask these questions again , if they need to do so .
the savings are as a result of posts on the establishment which could not be filled as a result of the sica report .
in the meantime , however , each minister will speak to his / her vote for the time that he / she is on the floor .
] could i ask the hon minister , given his reply , whether he was absent from cabinet on that day ?
i will certainly obtain the information as to whether it was teachers or officials - i do not have the information now .
as has been explained on numerous occasions , the money went into a central fiscus and it was distributed as they saw fit .
madam chairperson , my submission is that the 1998 and 1999 expenditure was a continuation for a service .
madam chairperson , could the hon premier indicate to the house from which particular programme and subprogramme this r4 000 was saved ?
i call the place where one registers a vote a poll , a polling station , whatever . four of them went there .
must my standing committee budget for the supper , or will the office of the speaker pay for it since the delay is occurring here ?
furthermore this was given in support of the director-general in the office of the president who asked us to help .
madam chairperson , i could only take a decision based on the information at my disposal at the time .
we know that the department of environmental affairs came to motivate that they need more money in the 2000-01 financial year .
] given that hindsight , the hon minister still has the opportunity not to authorise that expenditure now .
as the hon minister is very firm about teachers being at school every day , what action will she be taking ?
i would like to know how the hon minister applied her mind to this and from which programme that particular department could have saved r1,6 million ?
madam chairperson , we would like to have an answer or an opinion from the hon minister of education regarding the following .
madam chairperson , i am very grateful for the compliment , but i am not prepared to give any answer to that .
motions may , however , be put without notice , and i will allow the hon member mr dugmore to put his motion .
( 2 ) calls on the minister of agriculture , property management and works to immediately intervene and rectify the situation .
at the same time government cannot be suicidal and ignore the powerful , the skilled and those who are resourced .
with pride , mostly rightly , he mentioned developments like canal walk , grandwest , the v & a waterfront and the roggebaai canal .
chief spin doctor of the anc , the hon member mr dugmore should be more chastised by the election result .
mr speaker , the anc thought that they had an inalienable right to the support of the black voters of south africa .
furthermore , the employment programmes need to be coordinated from within that community , and not by some or other official or officials sitting somewhere else .
a large number of householders are being severely affected by the fact that their traditional sources of income are disappearing because there is no longer enough work .
mr speaker , the fact that in the entire speech the hon premier devoted only three lines to the gang problem is outrageous .
perhaps that is the message for all of us , but particularly for the hon premier and for the hon minister of community safety .
i want to emphasise to the hon premier and to the hon minister of community safety that in this regard we have certain responsibilities .
the time has come for the monitoring cameras to be introduced in the townships as well , because that is where crime is most felt .
if an anc member had mentioned this aspect in a speech , he / she would have called it " municipal police service " .
hon members know that in both instances the national government played an important role in addressing and resolving this .
sir , the hon premier has committed himself afresh to being the premier of all the people of the western cape .
where is the helping hand in their journey of life that the hon premier promised , or are these just again empty words ?
the old rent board has been abolished , but tenants face rapidly escalating rentals that are no longer subject to rental control .
the anc fared remarkably poorly in this ward in the local government elections , and it is quite obvious why .
i am quite aware that the local teacher is also the mayor and took two days off for this workshop .
mr speaker , i want to convey my best wishes for 2001 to you , the hon premier and hon members of the house .
the anc controls some of the municipalities in local councils outside the metropole and still enjoys support among key sectors of this province .
it is this realisation that has indeed embarrassed the hon premier and affected his performance in the province .
the hon premier should provide us with a plan that demonstrates the redistribution of resources and transforms the lives of these communities .
i bring this greeting to them not only from myself but from my constituency , that being plettenberg bay and knysna in the southern cape .
i would like to congratulate the town of knysna and all its inhabitants for being awarded south africa 's engen town of the year .
the gap between the rich and the poor is ever-widening and in this province it is going very well for the wealthy .
the hon minister of education can sit there and scream and shout as much as she wants to , but that is the problem .
] what has happened is that this family has not been able to pay the school fees because everyone in the house is unemployed .
the poor in the city earn less than r1 000 , and they constitute a third of the city 's people .
the hon premier has not told us how we are going to restore the lives of our extended families in this province .
the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs should not find it in the lotto ; he should find it where we are .
we cannot do what the np government of old did , give state maintenance grants to a small group of coloured , white and indian people .
when he was minister , they started two flagship projects for the women who were coming off the state maintenance grant .
we probably only have to drive down the n2 to realise why the focus of each of our parties is so very different .
sir , today it is a privilege to participate in the debate on the opening address of the hon premier .
i am actually asking you to seriously consider asking the hon member ms rossouw to withdraw that remark .
the proposed sites for nevirapine based on the mtct programme for the western cape included khayelitsha , paarl , worcester , guguletu , bonteheuwel and george .
almost 80 % of the exports of the western cape go to europe , while 60 % of agricultural exports world-wide come from this province .
he made mention of a motion that he wants to introduce which will compel us to stop the evictions at elsenburg .
many of them will not be able to find other sources of income , which will result in social problems , such as criminal activities , malnutrition and alcohol abuse .
it may be rogue elements , but by the hon premier 's silence he is actually condoning what they are doing .
the national minister for welfare and population development himself fears that aids will result in black people becoming a minority in south africa .
i am sure that the new deputy director-general will continue to manage the hiv / aids programme as efficiently as in the past .
our department of health has a commitment : we will strive this year to build the best hiv / aids unit in the world .
i am not sure whether it is as a result of that relationship , but the money has still not been spent .
mr speaker , this r10 million is not a reflection on how poverty relief money is generally spent in this province .
a total of r13 million was spent and we contributed , if i am correct in saying so , approximately r5,4 million .
i know that the hon minister is working on that , despite not getting in money from outside sources .
mr speaker , i was referring to somebody on our side of the house , not that side of the house .
madam chairperson , the intention of this government will always be that where it is necessary - for instance when shacks burn down ...
madam chairperson , i would like to ask the hon minister of community safety what the next priority areas for the installation of cameras are .
nevertheless it is true that after an interjection by the hon member mr dugmore , he referred to that hon member .
firstly , we call on the hon minister of transport and works immediately to draft a public transport policy .
the hon minister and i know that there is r22 million to draft a policy regarding transport in this province .
in the contract system one solution is fast-tracking the bringing in of small and medium enterprises in joint ventures in the public transport system .
i also wish to thank the national departments of transport and of safety and security for reinforcements that have been redeployed to the province .
a child in site b hospital had been shot and he died on the scene because there were no doctors .
mr speaker , do hon members know that in 15 police stations in the western metropole there is no longer a visible policing capacity ?
the first statement by the provincial government was made by the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation , who blamed recapitalisation .
let me say for the record that two years ago other provinces implemented legislation to deal with the taxi industry .
i am not quoting what anyone on this side of the house said - i am quoting the hon minister .
we need to regulate the taxi industry and we hope that at the same time it can be dealt with in an atmosphere of discipline and zero tolerance .
they need to feel the iron fist in order that tongues can start doing their work in fashioning an agreement that can be stuck to .
] if i close the taxi ranks , more people will die in the violence than have died thus far .
he said as long as the crisis continues , the taxis have more than they want .
mr speaker , the hon member mr ramatlakane also talked about training and the forming of a cooperative in this province .
( 3 ) six registered nurses be allocated to pma to bring about the recommended nursing complement of 14 registered nurses ; and
the " broad brush " idea of provincial government assistance for the construction of a convention centre was first mooted shortly after the 1994 election .
it is one of the fastest growing tourism sectors , accounting for about r80 billion in delegate expenditure globally in 1998 .
however , according to the april issue of the magazine , convention and incentive travel , cape town has leapt into the first place globally as the top-selling city for incentive travel .
mr speaker , as usual the hon member mr n m isaacs has once again misrepresented the position of the anc in the house .
mr speaker , we think that the shortcomings , the risk inherent in the shareholders ' agreement will come back to haunt the house .
mr speaker , cape town has achieved this ranking before the construction of its new international convention centre even began .
the building of this convention centre could give the necessary boost to tourism , which could result in billions in foreign exchange rolling into the western cape .
we on this side of the house wish to convey our sincere thanks to them - i think that is only good manners .
they then realised that we would be having our last sitting before the recess today , and they had therefore to push the bill through .
we have bound ourselves to a shareholders ' agreement that could have longer-term financial obligations , without considering the shareholders ' agreement .
the board consists of 12 members - i am not discussing the alternate members - and they are all men .
there were a number of disagreements on the board as to whether it should be only revel fox or whether we should go for something else .
there are a number of suspensive clauses in this agreement , but one such clause states that approval must be obtained for zoning and land use .
in the first agreement it was really simple - each of the partners had an equal share - 100 : 100 : 100 .
it is a whole new grading system that we were not briefed about and do not know the implications of .
for example , when mr hennie taljaard was short-listed for the position of ceo , he recused himself from all discussions .
we must consider the fact that every successful convention centre is extended at a particular point because it runs out of space .
the clarification we obtained was what the hon minister has now said , that it did not cover the shareholders ' agreement .
madam chairperson , i need clarity on why the wording has changed without official amendments being tabled here .
the auditor-general reported that tenders for the purchasing of sound equipment amounting to r33 006 could not be submitted .
mr speaker , in my response i shall discuss that briefly but i ask that the house agree to the bill as submitted .
mr speaker , we had two amendments under category b. we are very positive , we want to help and we want to build .
mr speaker , we are living in a country where creeping political control from the centre has become a key feature of this anc government .
all in all , the system is better suited to managing conflict resolution , especially during such a period of local government transition .
the whole idea is that we get inclusive local government at the executive committee level , where we can at least have all represented .
the hon member mr lewis stated briefly and concisely that he had considered the bill , understood and supported it .
i thank the hon member mr gelderblom for his contribution and for the perspective he outlined concerning the executive mayor .
i want to put a question to the hon member mr mckenzie about something in his speech that i cannot understand .
it makes one wonder : is pressure perhaps being exerted on people in the legal profession not to proceed with cases ?
the conclusion to which all these learned writers came was that the judges in the apartheid era were only procedurally and formally independent .
this is not my view but the view of learned lawyers - academic as well as practising lawyers - in the country .
] this is the only way that legitimacy and credibility will be bestowed on the judiciary in the eyes of all south africans .
upheld the mass detention and banning of political opponents and who reaped the benefits of those detentions and bannings .
] and that , despite the fact that the constitution of the republic of south africa act in section 165 provides , and i quote :
once again , the comments of hon members on that side of the house are based on what was reported in the newspapers .
the hon member mr dugmore asks that we mention an example of interference with the decisions of the judiciary .
after all , that is one way of questioning his judgment when he is persistently told that he comes out of the old era .
the hon premier was right when he said that no coloured person would vote for the dp under a dp banner .
] what we heard was speaking in terms of group politics , which is what we thought we had got away from .
mr speaker , the dp 's policy has always been to support the existence of trade unions and the right to industrial relations .
it does not matter that dr fidemofora is uninterested in doing her job and leaves the poor to perish .
jeremy gauntlett introduced a very nice term in the hansie cronj case , where he accused hansie cronj of " theological ventriloquism " .
before proceedings are suspended , i wish to give a ruling on the point of order raised by the hon member mr ozinsky .
in terms of my pronouncement earlier this is unparliamentary , although i gave the correct guidance but imposed it wrongly in respect of the words .
the hon member mr isaacs indicated his preparedness to withdraw the statements , and did so .
this is the kind of response that african and coloured people still receive today in south africa when they apply to banks for finance .
and the new np is not saying that for the first time today ; it has said so repeatedly in the past .
the new np supports these projects and the commitment of the cmr to the social and economic upliftment of the western cape communities .
i would like to thank the hon member ms essop for tabling the motion and leading the debate .
" they were also told that they would receive business benefits once they had joined up with the economic desk of the dp .
surely they do not exist because they are not applicable to a white constituency - it happens to the other constituencies .
however , they cannot guarantee that they will refer people to these black panel-beaters because they are not in preferred areas .
that is of course right , but it is a procedural step , very close to what dene smuts suggested , which was the class action .
proportionately already , the western cape has more entrepreneurs - many of them from black communities - than any other part of south africa .
i repeat , the recess is until 17 july 2000 and the next meeting of the house will be on 22 august 2000 .
" . 2.6 the treasury also confirmed that r2 million had since been made available from roll-over funds for the purchase of the reprographic equipment .
( f ) the purchasing of the equipment was executed on a verbal authority and that written authority was only provided afterwards .
that the house , after a visit by the standing committee on economic development to the areas of khayelitsha , mitchells plain and philippi -
the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works must hand the motion in to the table , after which the chair will be able to decide on it .
firstly , the western cape gambling and racing board is a vat registered body whereas the province is not vat registered .
if one looks at the sea points , the claremonts , the welgemoeds , the plattekloofs and so on one finds lovely green parks and lovely benches .
because at a local level we still refuse to outsource all services which can be provided more cheaply by private companies .
in terms of the proposed new legislation there will not be any tax rated on specific infrastructure in the metropolitan or non-metropolitan areas .
in this case a blank cheque is being given to a municipality in that they are able to impose this on the community after consultation with the community .
now the hon member mr mckenzie comes and points a finger here and says that there are other parties that do not provide the service .
according to the landbouweekblad this may be an indication that the attacks are linked to racial hatred , retribution and / or sheer terrorism .
madam speaker , i wish to thank the hon member mr a j williams for having introduced this subject in the house .
it is pointless our saying that we should maintain a minute of silence here in sympathy with people who are already dead .
the committee recommends that this chapter be referred back to departments ; that they reprioritise and make provision for it in their main budget .
mr speaker , i had thought that you would see me before the hon member mr silke ; indeed , i rose before he did .
3.1 this proposed amendment broadens the circumstances under which the board may pay a reward to informers , and has been necessitated by practical considerations .
there is no possibility that any person will offer horse racing without simultaneously applying for a totalisator and premise licence .
mr speaker , the standing committee on finance , environment planning and gambling supports the western cape ninth gambling and racing amendment bill fully .
the insertion of section 70a in law 4 enhances the ability of the board to monitor the integrity of the operator .
from this application it was clear that it was made to regulate the illegal building work that had been done on the site .
the new np has said - and marthinus van schalkwyk has said this over and over - that they are the corruption watchdog .
if it means that whoever is responsible in the south peninsula must answer to this , we will see to it that it happens .
one cannot simply appoint a commission of inquiry without at least having some form of prima facie evidence .
the anc have their backs to the wall and they will try with any sort of innuendoes to personally attack people .
however , as i have said , if the house investigates a matter and an hon member makes a wrongful accusation , then matters change .
fine , good enough , we are glad that we are at least getting the convenco board to look at its legal requirements .
his affidavit was unanimously accepted without discussion - according to the hon minister 's press statement , the board did not discuss the matter .
in fact , they did object and we have the minutes showing that they did object .
the hon minister 's own press statement says that it was not discussed at the convenco meeting , but was adopted unanimously without being discussed .
councillor mowzer was , in fact , three minutes late and in that time it was adopted but not discussed .
" then he is pushed and pushed and pushed and a day later he says , " oh , yes , my family have interests .
the hon member mr dugmore is quite correct , but we must take into account that hon members sometimes do not do it on purpose .
the hon member mr strachan said earlier on that mr mowzer , a director representing the city of cape town , was three minutes late .
i am at an age which is accepted in business and public life as being in the retirement period of one 's life .
this is the first occasion since the convention centre company was formed that any political matter has been brought into any board meeting of the ...
that the house congratulates penny heyns on winning the first medal for south africa at the olympic games in sydney , australia .
mr speaker , i move without notice , and trust that the motion will be unopposed on both sides of the house :
when one looks at it , it is clear that the intelligence service stands alone and without neglecting its duty , ensures that that information is conveyed .
in the good old days , before a minister or a very important person appeared in public , the whole place was under observation the entire day .
mr speaker , let us look at pagad 's vision and mission - they came into this for the right purpose .
the minister of community safety must reassure the people that he and his department are there to help them .
those plans have been implemented and i am delighted at the level of cooperation that we are , in fact , seeing at the moment .
in paarl many complaints have been received about brutality on the part of the police and these complaints are also along racial lines .
who serves on the cabinet is the sole discretion of a premier , who is obviously accountable to his party structures and hierarchy .
mr speaker , we can sit in this house and pretend that there is no legacy of racism in this country .
and , in a little while we are going to hear from that side of the house their sanctimonious and self-righteous chirping on the matter .
out of his cabinet , currently consisting of 10 ministers because they have been firing people left , right and centre , they have four coloureds , ...
it is not a white minister who is refusing to pay the reparations promised through the trc process .
in the limited time at my disposal i shall attempt to cover the whole issue of affirmative action in the pawc .
it is good and just to condemn the western cape government for their application of affirmative action and their delays in transformation .
mr speaker , originally the anc wanted us to consider two motions today , both dealing with issues surrounding racism .
mr speaker , crying " racism " has become a mantra for warding off criticism of the ruling party .
whites and blacks are now the dominant and the dominated , and the coloureds and indians are simply left out of the picture .
the government has been in power for six years - yet everything is still the fault of history and apartheid .
the fact of the matter is that if one takes into account the anc views on representivity , then they are deceiving the house .
mr speaker , the fact remains that racism is international and we must reject it here and overseas and wherever it occurs .
( 2 ) that the anc was prepared for this debate and is still prepared for it at any time ; and
basically that is what the hon member mr fransman and others tried to do when a farmer was murdered in the citrusdal district .
to me " boer " is not an ugly word , but " hottentot " and " kaffir " are ugly words .
i want to tell him that the anc does not have the sole mandate to speak on behalf of the workers of the western cape .
their actions are condemned and such employers can and will receive no sympathy from this side of the house , and ...
my daily visits to farms in the boland and elsewhere confirm what the human rights commission , non-government organisations , sectoral workers and others deplore every day .
this farmer was found guilty and is serving a prison sentence and no one is making a fuss outside the prison and saying that he should be released .
mr speaker , all this is part of the strategy by the anc to break down the relationship between farm workers and farm owners .
i call upon those hon members not to generalise in that way and say that all farmers treat their people badly .
the committee heard evidence to the effect that possible discrepancies at the department of health were investigated by the internal audit component of the administration .
( a ) the cost effectiveness thereof be monitored by the director-general with due cognisance of the other activities of the internal audit component ;
a legal opinion must to be obtained on the implications , mechanisms and constraints of the transfer of assets from a province to the nhls .
borrow money ; enter into indemnities or guarantees ; and enter into contracts , which may financially bind the national revenue fund .
( ii ) portfolio committee amendments to competition second amendment bill [ b41b-2000 ] .
although the overall amounts had already been voted on in the second reading debate , the committee stage was used to debate the principle once again .
mr speaker , i would like to alter my previous statement and add " except the hon minister of transport and works " .
mr speaker , there is a fallacy and a flaw in the logic presented by that side of the house .
the hon minister of education cannot put a question before she has been granted permission to put a question .
] i have given great thought to what he has said and i intend to continue with my frivolity .
an amount of r225,188 million has been allocated to improvement of conditions of service , which is r22 million more than originally indicated in the main budget .
( 2 ) these multinational pharmaceutical companies have tried all means to block cipla from supplying cheaper drugs in africa ; and
mr speaker , another issue that i want to bring to the attention of the hon premier is the fact that ...
in the same province that the hon premier is claiming is the best there have been incidents in various areas recently where children have been killed .
nevertheless , we are disappointed to learn that it has been communicated to us by the da that they would like to punish the acdp .
however , there are two issues to be dealt with which fall into the last category that i started my speech with , class inequalities .
in fact , the likud party received a higher percentage than labour had in the previous election , a record percentage .
mr speaker , the hon " dr dugmore " accuses the da of being against the labour laws in this country .
i am afraid that since his marriage , his spindoctoring and general advice to our comradely colleagues have not been of the best .
thereby giving the anc a proper mandate to govern almost 86 % of the population of the country , ...
at that time he could not have been sure that president mbeki would pay a snap visit to south africa on 2 february 2001 .
mr speaker , the fact remains that , for the first time , there has been a ruling on what constitutes a shelter , meaning a dwelling .
that was money given to the unemployed of leeu-gamka , and we are very proud of the fact that they obtained that money .
our hon ministers do not hesitate to give expeditious attention to issues relating to their portfolios - all the issues , no matter how small .
firstly , the hon member mr mckenzie is bitter about the coalition government because he jumped onto the wrong ship .
we should go there now in summer when it is going to be 35  and they have to live in those tin shacks .
i was a bit surprised at the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism talking about election results and failing support .
it seems that the bosberaad did not help much either , if one listens to the hon leader of the opposition .
that is why the opposition constantly grasps at straws in its efforts to put the government of the western cape in a bad light .
mr speaker , my department is involved with the organisation of major sports events and in particular with the absa athletics series ...
the hon premier should remember that a child in sport is a child not in court .
mr speaker , the idea of the hon premier to provide security for the residents of the western cape is really laughable .
mr speaker , it is indeed an honour and privilege to take part in this very interesting and complex debate .
it was the hon minister of health who spoke about the fact that elections revolve around perceptions and not facts .
their strategy was based on what the np did so effectively before 1994 , which was to play the race card .
if the hon member mr king wishes to express his opposition to its negative nature , the chair cannot rule that it is out of order .
he gave his version , and the hon member mr fransman is equally entitled to give his version .
yesterday we heard from the hon member ms rossouw that the anc lost miserably and won only one district council .
where our candidate , mr frans pietersen , took 76 % of the vote , her candidate took 13,25 % of the vote .
mr speaker , one will never find learners wandering around during school hours in the privileged areas and missing valuable education time .
we in the anc are the people who pick up the basic concerns of the people every day - not only at election time .
mr speaker , i want to concentrate on one point highlighted by the hon premier , and that is cooperation with other spheres .
three days before they were proclaimed , on 1 december 2000 , he consulted me on the matter , and then the proclamation took place on 4 december 2000 .
i want to highlight the case of paarl , where the mayor received r105 000 per annum before the transformation and amalgamation process .
mr speaker , i would like to express my gratitude to all hon members in the house for their kind words of congratulation .
that is nonsense , and i am on record as saying that i regard myself and the province as an integral part of the whole .
there is nothing new in the anc trying to label this government as being insensitive to the poor .
we in this province cannot allow this kind of racism and sectarianism to continue at the highest levels of our administration .
mr speaker , i am going to send a copy of the letter to the hon premier and then he can see it for himself .
the poor must be empowered to help themselves through sustainable projects which must be monitored on a regular basis .
it is a shame that at this point in time there are hon members of this government who do not have these services .
as long as efforts are being made in south africa to fit education into a budget , this illness will just get worse .
what is tremendously shocking is the fact that , after every incident , this commissioner was simply allowed to continue happily in the service .
the hon premier has come a long way - the tricameral parliament , the minister of police service , and so i could go on .
i quote from section 181 ( 2 ) for the benefit of those hon members who do not have it in front of them :
section 181 ( 3 ) then says , and this is probably the most important piece of advice that the government should take :
adv heunis , in his legal advice to the government on the matter of how it should deal with voter registration , says in section 16 :
a few months ago when teachers rendered an item in the civic centre they were chastised by the hon minister of education .
mr speaker , the hon premier has said that the western cape is a beautiful province - yes , it is , but to whom ?
it is a beautiful province only to the few , and i would like to tell the hon premier why i say so .
those amenities belong to all of us , not only to a certain few who live in table view or wherever .
the hon premier wants provincial policing powers so that he can continue to assure his own security and that of his clique .
if one went to guguletu , one would still have to cross a bridge ; but what about the houses right next to manenberg ?
mr speaker , it is unfortunate that in his speech the hon minister of housing again referred to one particular population group .
we have prioritised it in every minister 's portfolio as part of the 100-day initiative , and they know that all too well .
just like him and 95 % of the country , i think we are fortunate to be able to live in the western cape .
in belgium , if someone moves to another address , he or she must register the new address in that municipal area .
" walking the talk " for hiv / aids means , firstly , putting standard operating procedures in place .
] the dp said that they were gaining a great deal of new support , but the proof of support is in by-elections .
mr speaker , the coalition government know they are not fit or capable of leading the province as a government .
mr speaker , on a point of order : the hon minister in the office of the premier is conducting a running commentary .
i cannot curb the debate by not allowing the hon minister to proceed at this stage .
is it not strange that the people are asking the hon premier to talk about the achievements that they can see ?
the only thing that is lacking is the political will from the side of the government to address the issue .
however , the hon premier needs to go beyond that and translate those resources for the betterment of the lives of our people .
madam speaker , it is a proud moment indeed to be given the opportunity to participate in this debate .
the western cape has a very broad economic base , with many sectors and subsectors , which have given good prospects for further expansion .
the new np is an orderly party ; it is a party with structures and a party that recognises its grass-roots members .
it is a pity that the hon leader of the opposition adopted such a negative attitude towards the hon premier 's address .
from 1 december 1999 to 11 january 2000 , 94 people died on our roads , as against 143 deaths in the previous season .
mr speaker , we support - the hon premier has also done so - the recapitalisation programme of the national minister of transport .
] the hon minister of housing said in the house that the hon member mr dugmore was sitting in his pyjamas .
" he then said to me , " you see , it has always been a practice with me ; i always serve white people before coloured people .
mr speaker , i reject the pathetic attempt by the anc at racial and sectarian mobilisation with the contempt that it deserves .
i have no intention of trying to convince the hon members of the opposition otherwise .
mr speaker , let me come closer to home and refer to the anc 's little popcru team in the guguletu police station .
the hon premier has stated that 95 % of the population of the western cape are satisfied that the coalition is ruling this province .
he got a big round of applause from the people , who thought that it must be true because trevor manual said it .
the fact that it happens to be a white park and an anc member is constantly moaning and complaining about it , is only by the way .
i want to refer to a recent incident , the expulsion from his cabinet by the hon premier of the hon member mr marais .
i call upon this government not simply to pay lip-service to dealing with the disease , which affects young people particularly .
this complete lack of personal safety remains one of the leading reasons why south africa is seen as an investment risk by foreign investors .
the hon premier , his cabinet and his party have quite evidently let mr baadjies , and others like him who experience such evils every day , down badly .
he overruled him by saying that the management of the police was the problem that had to be addressed .
we have witnessed hon ministers not being able to respond to questions posed by the anc .
the dp is taking the new np 's support base , and the new np does not even realise it .
i want to make this call to the people outside , the very people who voted for the new np : " wake up !
in the first place , this gives greater certainty to departments and allows them to improve on spending and revenue plans .
the exact mechanism to achieve this , and more particularly the mandating process via myself , as provincial minister of finance , still requires clarification .
but against these restraints , i believe that we can point to considerable achievement by maintaining delivery despite budget cutbacks .
the current mtef period will see the full redemption of any debt and outstanding negative balances in our books of account .
the need to strike a balance in our capital budget between maintenance of that which exists and the creation of new infrastructure .
the abolition of the legal requirement that only a person with a medical degree may be in charge of a hospital facility .
a performance-driven management system must be put in place within a time-frame as agreed to by the provincial treasury , inclusive of the following :
it should be noted that a specific allocation of r10 million has been made for the management of poverty relief in the 1999-2000 adjustments estimates .
i was concerned to read in the budget speech of the national minister of finance that he had introduced an international departure tax .
vote 8 - agriculture [ pr 46 / 1999 ] ; vote 10 - environmental and cultural affairs [ pr 58 / 1999 ] ;
outstanding financial statements for the 1997-98 financial year of local governments in the province of the western cape [ pr 13 / 1999 ] ;
there was a lack of , firstly , a proper parliamentary support service and , secondly , a proper waiting area outside the committee room of the western cape parliament .
that the r770 000 budgeted for political parties in respect of clerical assistance be referred to the rules committee for review .
the future appearance of the speaker and the administration of the provincial parliament before the standing committee be referred to the rules committee .
but you see , sir , the hon leader of the opposition and his party has a little bit of a problem when it comes to poverty relief .
if they want to try and silence us from their self-proclaimed moral high ground , we will expose their hypocrisy and we will cut them to size .
sir , for that reason this new np-led coalition government will not permit collapse and corruption to run rampant in this province .
he says he is waiting for regulations from national government by way of the national procurement policy preferential framework bill .
must be regulated in terms of an act of parliament , which may be enacted only after any recommendations of the financial and fiscal commission have been considered .
then , if we supplied one motor car for every 25 policemen , it would come to 320 motor cars , which means another r32 million .
it means that immediately , from day one , one will not need to fill in a tax form to obtain the money .
it is thus worthwhile to note the concerns and issues raised by business people in this province .
as we have heard on so many occasions from members of the anc , they received 42 % of the vote .
mr speaker , on a point of order : can the hon minister make his speech as if we are not accepting the budget ?
] the 0,1 % with which i did not agree was the fact that i do not have shares in the fishing industry .
clearly , hon members of the house , including me , have called for the resignation of ministers for doing the most ridiculous things .
] nevertheless , that hon member stood up on his hind legs earlier and said that he accepts the scof report .
madam chairperson , as premier i have been tasked to give administrative effect to the strategic objectives and core functions of this administration .
madam chairperson , i have given this house a brief overview of what my department is doing and how it is spending its money .
i would like to give hon members an outlook of the 2000-01 budget , which includes the three-year mtef cycle as reported by the hon minister .
they are aware of my submission in the house about this matter during which i had my business plan here and showed it .
may i underline again that it is a great honour for me to be part of the western cape governing team .
she informed me of her surprise to discover so many hiv-positive or aids-infected colleagues in the force .
already there is the danger of limited or inadequate research time for legislation and the resulting road to certification can be highly problematic .
by way of comparison , here are a couple of illuminating cases from the eastern cape 's department of corporate services which i would like to highlight .
madam chairperson , i really believe that these regional agreements are of critical importance to the province , as we have seen previously .
the issues of racism and apartheid should have been well received by the dp on the other side of the house .
all the speakers here today have spoken contrary to what the hon minister in the office of the premier said .
the hon member mr e isaacs said a business plan was important , but the implementation of that plan was even more important .
i then showed you all the business plans and asked you whether i should quote them or hand them over to you .
how many times have i stood here as the premier of this province and extended a hand of friendship to them ?
then they walked out . but this province still gave those mayors the cheques , because the cheques were not for them .
when i talk in terms of transformation , i said that those hon members had reiterated most of the things i had said .
if one looks into the annals of history , one will see that an opposition party never says that in its opening speech .
the hon member will therefore be free to move a motion or give notice of a motion first thing tomorrow afternoon .
the committee notes with concern the decrease in adult-based education and requests the department to address the matter .
in doing so , i am also part of the transformation process regarding the convention that the speaker never makes a speech in the house .
on the instructions of the rules committee , the parliamentary staff drew up , for the first time , a budget on the basis of actual needs .
as far as information technology is concerned , we will finally be able to supply each member with a personal computer this year and also acquire quite a number of extra printers .
i wonder how many hon members have noticed that the annual report of these team mates of ours was already on our desks last friday .
madam chairperson , one of the new things that we can begin doing is making our former members feel welcome among us .
there are problems that have been there for the past five years , and we are still dealing with them today .
let me state for the record that the anc accepts that the provincial parliament must be capacitated , including the standing committees .
yesterday , when we were listening to the dp speaking , we were reminded of a statement that was made a long time ago .
madam speaker , i request that the budget be reviewed because i do not believe it is a fair allocation .
i cannot support capital expenditure amounting to r500 000 without the necessary translators to man them .
one of the mechanisms prescribed by the provincial constitution for this oversight and accountability function of parliament is the system of committees .
] i have already done that , it is on the face of it - on that hon member 's face , if he wishes .
madam chairperson , the hon member mr king also referred to the involvement of mpps in drawing up the budget .
the speaker , as the political head , and the secretary to parliament , who is the accounting officer , would be in serious trouble .
( a ) i attended in my capacities as deputy leader of the dp and minister of environmental and cultural affairs .
my tour of the southern cape also included visits to george and mossel bay museums , related to my cultural portfolio .
i put it to the hon premier , the house and the hon minister that this is a misuse of taxpayers ' money .
mr speaker , i would like to thank the hon member mr williams for answering those questions so adequately for me .
] the minister : mr speaker , i do however agree with the hon member mr williams that it was mostly a courtesy call .
the voter registration process is open to corruption because there are no mechanisms in place to control the process here by this government .
not once has a single one of the officials touched one of the forms which were to be dealt with by the iec .
( ii ) we have taken the advice of an economic advisory committee consisting of mr patrick parring , adv christo wiese and dr mamphele ramphela .
mr speaker , i am not so sure that this has anything to do with arson , the subject matter .
mr speaker , with respect , must i really react to what the newspapers state as though they are the fountain of all truth ?
at the moment a difficult process of defining and upgrading this register is being undertaken , with specific reference to the properties in the metropole .
as can be seen from the second page of the report in front of the hon minister , it was submitted on 27 august 1999 .
] the fact that the report is here today means that both the hon premier and i are satisfied with the report .
council informed the provincial government that thus far no official zoning has been allocated to this portion of land .
disbursements were recovered from registration fees and income generated from outcomes of the project and paid back to the interim council for cultural affairs .
mr speaker , to correct the comment made by the hon member mr mckenzie , i did not call the meeting .
( 2 ) whether the western cape provincial tender board has rejected any such tenders ; if so , what reasons have been given for such rejection ?
mr speaker , on a point of order : may i respectfully draw your attention to the fact that you skipped question 11 ?
the hon members mr gelderblom and ms rossouw who have to appear in the ncop , had to be there by 15 : 00 .
we could then use our discretion in awarding the funds to disadvantaged schools to help them in art and culture .
my question to him is : what will he be able to do for the next monthly payout , because we are going to have this problem again ?
mr speaker , i would have expected such a long question to be given to me in writing and tabled .
mr speaker , no , i would not agree to that because i believe that judge heath and my department have a good working relationship .
i think that one should level that rather at that sphere of government , which might have been responsible for any delays in this regard .
my question is : is it the intention of the government to change planning legislation so that it can be practically implemented ?
legal advice suggested that the applicant 's application met all the demands for an action of this nature and would without doubt be successful .
( 4 ) steps have been taken to identify members of parliament to the security guards by means of photos .
i did not have sight of it before it was submitted to the ncop , so i cannot comment on that .
if we look at africa , we are the one province that has a sister relationship with tunis ; that is our commitment to africa .
mr speaker , i believe that bridges have been built and that our nation and theirs can now across those bridges .
before i answer this question we must first determine what is meant with the term " inhuman brutality " so that no misunderstanding exists .
sir , i am grateful to be able to say that i am not aware of inhuman brutality taking place daily among farm workers .
mr speaker , let me tell hon members the story , which i really think is the story of a good samaritan .
unfortunately mr mcotshana did not take the prescribed medicine regularly , and did not keep himself or his residence clean .
to tell the truth , he did everything he could and simply cannot be accused of paternalistic conduct .
these days one cannot just call people to come forward and make a preacher of everyone whose collar one turns round .
i am not attacking officials , but it is because managers never get the chance to manage their directorates properly .
since the end of the 24-hour operation , the security forces have remained present in the affected areas so as to ensure the maintenance of order .
dealing with the issues includes the establishment of the transport consultative forum , which at this point has not been implemented .
( c ) the main reason for closing the aforementioned schools was a drastic decline in learner numbers to less than 12 .
mr speaker , the question was put in afrikaans , and i will not allow myself to be dictated to by the hon member mr lewis .
mr speaker , i just want to say that we will not be dictated to by the anc , the udm or any other political party .
one of the key elements of the plan is the legalisation of illegal operators through the implementation of the be legal campaign .
is there any intention to source funding for the approval of eias to fund the process in the department ?
if the project require any additional support to these currently rendered by the department , they are more than welcome to direct their request through the local extension officer who will facilitate such requests .
mr speaker , on a point of order : i would like to raise an issue regarding the questions on the question paper .
( b ) the waiting times for hip replacements are at best over 18 months , which could well be viewed as unacceptably high .
in the past the practice was to continue paying a salary for as long as one month .
( 1 ) which criteria are currently in use with regard to awarding the provincial treasury account to a bank or banks ;
i do not go to tenderers and ask them questions after a tender has been awarded , unless information is placed before me .
i would like to see that properties are optimally used and one of the options may be the outsourcing of functions of property management .
if he wants to ask that question , he must put it to the saps and the sandf and they will tell him .
after the complaints had been submitted to the national department , they came to the attention of the branch : transport in cape town .
if the hon member mr ramatlakane wants to know about actions taken earlier , this has now been placed on record and we shall look at it .
however , national legislation must prescribe - and i highlight " must prescribe " - a framework in which the preference procurement policy may be implemented .
mr speaker , i would like to point out that it is not my consultant - it is the board 's consultant .
hon members should ask those questions of the board , and i would be delighted to facilitate the answers to the questions .
mr speaker , the hon member ms essop makes my hair stand on end , as the hon leader of the opposition called it .
i am delaying it in order to bring in a procurement policy in the province where we will not chop and change .
( v ) in the event that additional funding is required , the company has set in place a process to identify solutions to any additional funding requirement .
mr speaker , the hon member mr ozinsky will see that in my next reply i deal with the guguletu day hospital .
( 1 ) whether there was a shortage of some medicines at the guguletu hospital between 24 july and 11 august 2000 ;
if the hon member mr dugmore has any respect for his own members he will listen and then ask a question afterwards .
since its inception on 1 december 1998 it has met five times - on average , twice a year .
( 2 ) whether any of these prisoners have been re-arrested for crimes which they committed since their release ;
if our data is correct , it can be expected that report card fraud will not have a major effect on senior certificate pass rates in the year 2000 .
( 2 ) the pilot dial-a-ride project , started in may 1998 , is continuing in the khayelitsha and mitchell 's plain areas .
the comments of the city of tygerberg are awaited before the matter is investigated by the department of local government .
the hiv / aids budget , both national and provincial , does not make provision for the supply of first aid kits to schools by the state .
how does he reconcile the receiving of the golden arrow and silver arrow awards with the continuing decline in service delivery in this province ?
mr speaker , i do not have to state that categorically , because pmr is part of an advertising campaign and pmr is independent .
however , if one wants to publish it for one 's people , one will take a certain amount of advertising space to do so .
mr speaker , i will first answer the last part of the question put by the hon member mr isaacs .
mr speaker , i still want to know whether the former minister of community safety , sport and recreation is , in fact , working for the consulting company .
if mark wiley is involved there , and even if he is being paid , he is not doing it for the love of money .
over the past year , the minister of community safety has steadily begun to build a strong coalition of forces opposed to criminals and their crime .
this membership , which grants special guest status , was obtained after my visit to the annual general meeting of the assembly in lyons in december 1999 .
the western cape has led the way in preventing the transmission of hiv / aids from hiv-positive mothers to their children .
we now welcome the intervention of the national minister of health , who has approved two test sites in each of the other provinces .
equally , we remain top of the league in education , once again achieving the highest matric pass rate in the country - 80,6 % .
mr speaker , scof arrived at a non-partisan agreement to express its concern over the roll-over funds which are constantly increasing .
i know that the hon member mr strachan will support me in regard to the capital venture facilitation fund of r1,2 million .
in principle roll-overs , i agree , have to be watched very carefully indeed that the figure should not increase dramatically year after year .
mr speaker , this concludes my remarks concerning funds which have become available to the province from the province 's own revenue sources .
together with the funds which have become available from the national government , these aggregate to r263,2 million shown in the adjustments estimate .
that the house expresses its sympathy with the family in bishop lavis who tragically died this morning when their house burnt down .
the hon member mr dugmore should have stayed in mauritius and enjoyed himself , and not made a noise here .
mr speaker , on a point of order : the hon member mr ozinsky asked , " how much money is in his pocket ?
as far as health is concerned , much was said about my not mentioning hiv / aids in my opening address .
it is obvious that the anc will never reconcile themselves to the fact that they are not part of the cabinet .
we respectfully draw your attention to the fact that the standing rules do not expressly prescribe the process by which decisions are taken .
we do not interfere as such ; we litigate , if we can , from the province 's side .
that is a bit of a misrepresentation , because in fact the full complement of new recruits to this province in five years is 118 .
( 3 ) whether the department plans to lease vacant houses and / or flats ; if not , why not ?
can the hon minister rely on the new minister of social services to have constructive discussions on this matter with him ?
madam chairperson , i must say that the intimate discussion between the hon leader of the opposition and his benchmate is somewhat disturbing .
we have now rebuilt our technical skills base and established an infrastructure , and are in a position to embrace the digital era .
currently they employ only 3 blacks out of a total of 290 employees in that department , 124 coloureds and 158 whites .
in the western cape decades - if not centuries - of institutional thuggery of a shameful race-based system has taken a heavy toll .
secondly , we feel very encouraged and want to thank the hon minister of finance and development planning in the spirit of cooperative governance .
for some time now we in the western cape have disputed the national census figures which actually show us to be in population decline .
i truly believe that the greatest challenge to this government - and i will always say this - is raising revenue .
madam chairperson , i want to just say a little about the legislation on public finance management that dr stegmann introduced us to .
in the housing department , for instance , the people might announce that they are going to build 2 000 houses , but , at the end of the day , what is the quality of those houses ?
the anc must celebrate this achievement , the fact that they have been able to educate everybody into accepting the process .
in the private sector , one often finds brilliant ideas , thinking and marketers , but a lack of financial management expertise can sink such an undertaking .
firstly , he commented on the gambling industry and how he wanted to deal with problem gambling ; and , secondly , there was his reference to financial management .
madam chairperson , in this very impressive document there is an organogram that shows how the procurement policies for the new casino are going to work .
madam chairperson , i am not now going to turn to a new subject , that of ppp , because ppps could stand for something else as well .
] i want to say to him that i am with him absolutely on each and every word that he spoke there .
that is the undertaking that i have given , and the hon member can remind me of it when or if it does not happen .
the hon member mr gabru made , before that hon member woke up in this house when he came here , because ...
that is possibly why communist china , not known for its human rights record , has the world 's fastest growing economy .
during the next few months infantry-fighting companies , often used in support of saps , will drop from 22 to 12 companies .
various programmes were run together with the saps under the banner of the aaa project , which in effect replaced the stamp out crime campaign .
two hundred coordinators will be trained during the course of this financial year on a variety of topics at a cost of almost r500 000 .
visible policing has repeatedly been proven to be the most effective crime prevention vehicle , and therefore the department will continue to underwrite the cpo scheme .
madam chairperson , first of all , i would like to thank the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation for the effort he puts in .
madam chairperson , you will have noted that i mentioned the dp before the new np despite the mathematical expression on that side .
he is under the mistaken impression that he has no role to play , because he lacks the powers .
madam chairperson , the anc says that trauma rooms and support services must be introduced immediately at all police stations so that we can also begin to train volunteers .
] the inefficient members of the police force should face sanctions for any breach of performance and this should be applied rigorously .
mr chairperson , i am also looking forward to cooperating with the cpo project via the standing committee on government affairs and community safety .
these are important measures when it comes to providing information to the police and in regard to the patrolling of particular wards in townships .
madam chairperson , if that is the extent to which we care about the problem that our young people are struggling with , then we will really listen .
the first is that of the police , from whom they get instructions , and the second is the board , who also gives them instructions .
in the original discussions , the idea was that the time they spent working as community police officers would be credited to their hours as reservists .
however , to say that the department or the police are doing little about certain matters and to blame me and them ...
madam chairperson , there are two major policy objectives for the department of sport and recreation for this financial year as well as the next financial year .
i am firmly convinced that this province has the capacity to become the number one province sportswise in the country .
however , sir , i think the time has come for us in this house to attend coaching clinics if we really want to make a contribution .
the hon minister needs to speak to the hon minister of education to upgrade the schools , so that they can accommodate his plans .
a child in such a school is often better able to cover the cost of his sport himself .
it was mentioned several times that the hon minister should ensure through his programme that there is progress in this regard .
if we look at the total amount in programme 4 , an amount of r4,53 million was given towards development .
in particular , this should be done as part of the programme for 2000-01 , namely to host two international and five national sporting events .
with respect , how are we going to host two international and five national sporting events with r1,5 million , and then still give support to 80 codes of sport ?
and - if the western province wants to get out of the hole , that is where they must look at - the coaching .
this is nothing short of the type of racism that not only prevails in sport , but also in this house ...
to achieve this goal , more effective strategising with business and labour leaders of the western cape will remain a priority , and this is already taking place .
introducing biosphere technology to create a more harmonious balance between development and the environment , including river restoration and greening projects .
an exhibition of the famous austrian composer , anton brueckner , will be opened here by the governor of upper austria , dr joseph puehringer next month .
my ministry is already calling unannounced at various provincial facilities - as i will be doing myself , and more so than ever before .
having said this , mr speaker , i want to stress that the western cape government nevertheless believes in cooperative governance on all levels .
in only 40 days , between 1 december 1999 and 11 january this year , 914 people died in road accidents in south africa - 914 people !
hon members will have seen a report in wednesday 's cape argus about the living hell of voorbrug secondary school in delft .
in the year ahead we will continue to implement our time management plans , but things are not as easy as they sound .
during the years ahead we also hope to introduce appropriate benchmarks at the end of grades 6 and 9 .
the effort of introducing a new curriculum has left our subject advisory services and our curriculum services with very little spare capacity for much else .
eventually all western cape schools should have an internet connection and the wced plans to switch to an information and communication technology-based communication strategy .
in terms of this policy , our present underutilised reform schools and schools of industry will close on 31 december , and new institutions will open on 1 january 2001 .
as a mark of appreciation , the standing committee made eight boxes of hanepoot available for the eight officials who are present here today .
a report was issued after the inquiry and recommendations were made as to the shape of the new youth care system for south africa .
she is one of many in the education department who have taken on the mammoth task of creating quality , sustainable education in our province .
next , mr chairperson , i want to congratulate the officials of the western cape education department on the way in which they have implemented this national legislation .
even though it must happen there , i think that the political will that my benchmate spoke about can make an enormous difference .
the first is outstanding and world-class training for students and teachers and the retraining and professional upgrading of experienced teachers within a negotiated service contract .
in 1998 , 1,5 % of students matriculated with higher grade maths and science , the majority of these still being white .
there was enormous disillusionment when it was found that the " good " that was intended in fact resulted in negativity .
could the parents not rather have become involved in a different project so that the school grounds could be paved , with a smaller grassed area ?
madam chairperson , it has also come to my attention that at the end of 1999 there was a statutory amendment in regard to management body posts .
the above comments are not meant to outline that everything is well in the province , as the hon premier is claiming .
i want to thank the hon minister for her major contribution to the projects for the prevention and distribution of aids at schools .
concerning the key government outcome , improvement of public confidence in the school system , the following : south africa , like all nations , needs a vibrant public education system .
in regard to the election of management bodies that is now taking place despite the fact that elections have to take place later this year , i am entirely in agreement with her .
i want to tell the hon member that the problems at khanyolwethu go far further than just the physical circumstances that she sees there .
the restructuring will be undertaken in such a way as to correspond with the proposed devolution of primary health care services to local government in july 2001 .
i also wish to mention that an amount of r5 million has been set aside for the purchase of 20 new emergency ambulances in the 2000-01 financial year .
under the guidance of the business manager , we will implement definite and courageous strategies to increase revenue and savings this year as follows :
the improvement of our public image is essential if we want people back in our hospitals and if we want them to pay .
in this regard i am determined that the branch : health and our institutions must utilise the available money cost-effectively for capital works and improvements .
i would like to take this opportunity to thank netcare , mediclinic and the afrox group for their support in this venture .
the increase in the budget can be entirely taken up by the preventative aspects , with very little for promotive and curative aspects .
the western cape government needs to provide funds for such care , as more and more people move from hiv to full-blown aids .
the emphases should be on health promotion and disease prevention , which will have a far greater impact on child survival than just treatment of disease .
it is vital that any programme that is developed in maternal and child health is not vertical , and adopts an integrated , comprehensive approach .
i therefore call upon the hon minister to devise mechanisms to look into this serious issue very closely .
this in spite of the fact that visits to our primary health care centres have increased from 1,8 million in 1996 to 2,9 million in 1998 .
i thank the department for making such a provision , but i am disappointed that no school nutritional programme exists for preschool children .
the provincial aids council that we envisage here will certainly not originate in the controversy with which it has been associated at the national level .
social services currently operates on the model where 13 district offices and 8 institutions are directly linked to the head office of the branch .
there are no shelters for victims of violence in that area and no shelters for adults either .
i want to refer to the six interrelated pillars that are important for this province in order for us to address the issue .
if we look at the beneficiaries and the numbers , we see that there are 320 000 in the western cape at this stage .
i am briefly going to refer to the payout system , because i am aware that one of my colleagues might just address this as well .
i should like to draw the attention of hon members to the information passed on to me by the officials of the department of welfare .
i have understanding and sympathy for the national minister of welfare and population development when he says , " i am embarrassed about this failure .
it will be a role of monitoring and evaluation , project identification and project development , while project implementation will rest with the various departments and external role-players .
these are the beautiful gates home , where 10 children have been approved for funding , and nazareth house , where 44 children have been approved for financing .
even one 's client service starts changing , because people who come from those communities cannot very easily turn their backs on those communities .
we must remember that the only people who received maintenance grants pre-1994 were coloureds , and some whites and indians .
mr chairperson , this department must then take responsibility for these children and do this with a diminishing budget in real terms .
mr chairperson , there are many state-owned buildings in the province that are standing empty and going to ruin .
mr chairperson , i would like to end off by saying that in 1997 the convention on the rights of the child was drawn up .
in fact , we have things like the hon premier 's message - " slow and sure is the morkel style " .
nevertheless , we should challenge national government on issues like the means test , which drastically reduces the pensions of people who remain economically active .
on financial control issues , we referred to the slas and the way in which we will allocate funds in the new financial year .
the nine members of the new board have a sound knowledge of housing and related fields , and were appointed only after an extensive screening process was followed .
most of these problems are already known to hon members , and i do not want to waste valuable time harping on about them .
we have already planned for the so-called additional funds which we will receive for the coming financial year .
if the momentum of housing delivery is to be maintained , as it must , we will have to find innovative ways of generating income .
the department of housing has structured a capacity-building course that will include the training of potential beneficiaries in the role and responsibilities of home-owners .
the department of housing has already made representations to the national minister of housing for the reintroduction of a pre-emptive right over these subsidy houses .
the blueberry hill project , also known as hillcrest , envisages providing 2 329 units valued at between r60 000 and r100 000 .
i also wish to refer you to rule 44 , which provides that a member may not be prevented from making his speech .
madam chairperson , my department and i are hauled over the coals from all sides and accused of not performing .
this is the brilliant performance that this hon minister does not even bother to mention in his speech , and he is directly responsible for it .
he proudly told this house that the metropolitan housing and urbanisation forum , convened by the province , would complete this task .
we know that the housing fund has not yet been established - another of the 100-days commitments by 1 april that we are waiting for .
as public representatives i am sure we all feel the pressure from the public on housing related matters - and it hurts .
people in delft , du noon and happy valley are suffering from all kinds of diseases because cheap materials are used to build these houses .
whatever he is doing , i am sure he wants to be able to say at the end of the day , " that was my work .
madam chairperson , i would like to congratulate the hon minister of housing and his department on the presentation of vote 8 - housing .
section 81 ( j ) of the constitution of the western cape expressly refers to the circumstances of our people in the rural areas .
what i do have a problem with is that the writing off of debts allegedly applied only to certain sectors in those communities .
] i therefore wish to thank hon members on that side of the house sincerely for their contribution to the committee 's business this morning .
this is not only a disgrace to paarl , but a disgrace to the western cape and to south africa !
she is in the visitors ' gallery today to hear whether i convey the situation of the people of amstelhof to the hon minister .
another problem with housing is that the metropole has a housing waiting-list of 230 000 , as the hon minister of housing reported .
if that is the rate at which we are going to work , what are the requirements that arise over those 10 years going to be like ?
at haarlem there is half-built or three-quarter-built housing that has been standing there , without any progress , for the past two or three years .
we cannot successfully do that with an end product of 15 m  to 20 m  , as we have at present .
it is unfortunate that the response regarding this position was disappointing , and that it was decided not to accept any of the applicants .
madam chairperson , in the first instance i want to thank all the hon members who took part in the debate for their participation .
] i never promised the people in the cape town area that i would build them 5 000 houses per annum .
i must state here that i have undertaken no interventions in terms of section 139 of the constitution in the province so far .
it was initially r73 million , but the national government saw fit to allocate an additional r10 million to the western cape .
in many cases one of the important points is the uncoordinated political presence - i would almost say interference - when a disaster occurs .
the last point that i want to mention in relation to the shortcomings is the hopelessly inadequate infrastructure and allocation of funds from all three spheres of government .
a formula will be put on the table by the national minister , but i at least have the authority to amend it by 10 % .
we have cautioned the municipalities - that is one of the points of our moratorium - not to appoint too many officials now .
when we look at the increase in salaries , we would like the municipalities to stop at what was negotiated with the trade unions .
] that hon member should not worry , i am going to do the same to her when it is her turn to speak .
madam chairperson , on behalf of the anc i want to thank and praise the department of local government for the work they have done .
the hon minister of local government in his budget speech told us of the millions of rand that were given to certain projects .
i have not heard today what he is doing to advise local authorities to reverse the culture of non-payment for services .
during the 1993-94 period we noted large overexpenditure by the then central government in full knowledge that their sins would go untouched .
in addition , outsourcing services that can be more cheaply undertaken by the private sector , and particularly smmes , must become a priority for the new structures .
indeed , senior management can also be disruptive , and general fatigue that restructuring has caused over the past four years is a contributory factor .
i have spent some time thinking about this and have concluded that it could be that i have a completely distorted picture of multiparty democracy .
madam chairperson , it is clear that those problems are not confined only to municipalities controlled by a certain party .
madam chairperson , first of all i wish to congratulate the hon minister of local government and his department on a department well run .
these moneys come via the provincial government , through our minister , to local authorities and escapes scrutiny by this house .
the time has come for a coordinated western cape disaster fund to which local authorities , provincial government and the private sector must contribute annually .
why can tony leon attack the new np every day and describe them as losers , while new np members may not even react to that ?
he and the hon member mr mckenzie asked where my disaster management legislation was and why i did not put it on the table .
it was said that attention would be given to voter education , but - and this is very interesting - look at how he is dealing with the matter there .
on 1 july 1997 , 10 000 members of staff were shifted in the metropole alone , and with them the assets and liabilities .
i had to look at the representation that we had in the metropolitan area and the representation that we had in the district municipalities .
portfolio committee amendments to remuneration of public office bearers amendment bill [ b 11a-2000 ] .
portfolio committee amendments to remuneration of public office bearers amendment bill [ b 11c-2000 ] .
as the hon minister correctly pointed out , we want to make it more acceptable by approaching the executive in the correct manner .
accordingly i am going to rule for the last time that the hon member mr byneveldt moves the motion and we shall then decide on it .
the provincial planning committee focuses on the cabinet objectives as part of its strategic process in the formulation of a provincial vision , mission and objectives .
they are a highly professional group of planners , and this province is indeed fortunate to have a dedicated team of this calibre .
madam chairperson , we have a unique situation in the western cape of missionary settlements , such as genadendal , friemersheim , elim , wittewater , wuppertal and mamre .
] it is not my role to praise his strengths , though , so i must go on to his weaknesses .
] i want to point out to them that we are watching the process of what they do with the land at valkenberg .
it was meant , as he said last year , to be submitted to cabinet shortly and published as a green paper .
the second is the buffer zone which is less ecologically sensitive , but mostly natural where recreation such as camping , cycling and boating is permitted .
it is also an area where certain sustainable utilisation of the natural resource can be accommodated , like wildflower harvesting or fishing .
it is interesting that the hon member from the anc said that the inhabitants of fish hoek would be pleased with this decision .
they say , " we do not know where they got those statistics from , " and then present us with different statistics .
this aspect of planning has always been a painful exercise , because it entails zoning and all kinds of aspects when it comes to town planning .
i want to state that it is absolutely impossible to do that because , at every level where planning decisions are taken , there are politicians involved .
for the various disciplines to nominate 90 % white people and 10 % women , if i remember correctly , is simply not good enough .
finally , the hon member mr ozinsky had a second bite at the cherry and talked about the provincial development council and the green paper .
the pollution and solid waste component in our department will have as its primary task the development of policy and legislation on these matters .
the anti-aids campaign has moved beyond simply awareness and education programmes into targeting changes in lifestyle and behaviour modification .
we shall therefore look at changes in lifestyle and behaviour modification in our programmes in order to prevent both pollution and aids .
language is not only the medium we use to communicate , but also an important part of what gives us our identity .
such programmes should regularly be evaluated against the programme objectives and results achieved in an attempt to improve its effectiveness .
we are very concerned about the increasing marginalisation of the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs by the hon premier and his cabinet .
there is almost a perception that if one wants a good book or access to a library one first has to commit an offence .
we have a tough road ahead of us , but by combining our efforts the western cape government team will be victorious .
concerning the project on aids in the workplace , i can inform hon members that at present it consists of a newsletter and awareness campaigns .
i must say , however , that the acdp is concerned with the paradigm shift to what the hon minister calls " popular culture " .
in his speech today , the hon minister did mention that a policy framework would be drafted by people who had been elected democratically ...
as we know , j & b whisky sponsored the gay and lesbian film festival by a large amount not so long ago .
in the presentation by the hon minister today and in the manuals presented to us , there is very little about biosphere training .
we shall assume the worst until the eia proves otherwise , because we are dealing with something that can seldom be reversed .
our new government has put in place legislation to rectify the injustices of the past , but we need a culture of tolerance .
those who gained skills through apartheid have a moral obligation to share them with those less fortunate .
one man told me that he spent r450 per month driving from hout bay to paarden eiland to go and work .
as i mentioned in my speech , this matter is bigger than many rugby and soccer matches , and the media has nothing to say about it .
i would also like to thank her for her committed approach in the corridors of this house to hiv / aids and to fighting it .
i am sure she has had an influence on many ministries with her commitment and passion for fighting this pandemic .
the intention of the brown component in the department is to attend to the management of solid waste , rubbish removal and pollution control .
he accused the hon member mr byneveldt in particular of calling on people not to pay .
i am going to leave it at that and caution hon members that if such behaviour takes place in the house , we will not allow it .
[ therefore , we would like to institute wide-ranging initiatives , as far as transport is concerned , following a new vision and using new ideas .
provide and maintain a provincial road network that is of a sufficient standard to enable goods and passengers to be transported economically ;
madam chairperson , with regard to roads , joint ventures between the private sector and the government will be of utmost importance in the future .
subsidies are currently being paid to the golden arrow bus service in terms of a temporary bus contract to maintain 700 buses in the metropolitan area .
the operational plans will detail the actions that need to be undertaken in each region to realise the strategies of the strategic plan .
the road traffic safety strategic plan has the specific objective of reducing pedestrian fatalities in this province by 10 % before the year 2005 .
furthermore , i want to convey my appreciation to mr van heerden for being so concerned about the assets of the province .
madam chairperson , before i commence my speech i would like to make a few comments regarding the budget speech by the hon minister .
" we say to them , " we are waiting for a planning system " or " we are waiting for the metropolitan transport authority to be established .
i am not an ardent supporter of casino money , but i do hope the hon minister will use these funds for road maintenance .
i am pleased to see the hard work that has been done in dorp street and that the operation has now been completed .
i would at the same time like to thank the hon minister for spending r2 million on the building in dorp street and the provincial parliament .
this is the regulation which provides that the clearance certificate must be displayed in the bottom left-hand corner of the front windscreen of a vehicle .
they then toured the entire town and wrote out r100 fine tickets for virtually everyone in the town , and everyone had to pay their fines .
at home , here in the western cape , this has created space for women and the youth to benefit through the community-based public works programme .
i am happy that mincom has decided to extend this process in order fully to address the outstanding taxi problems .
the hon minister did not refer to this matter , but perhaps he intends to refer to it in his reply .
in particular i would like to single out mr mike spence who took a transfer from that lovely province , kwazulu-natal , to come to the western cape .
we , of course , continue to pledge our support for the department in their realisation of the goals of public transport as set out in the white paper .
could the chief whip , the hon member mr king , and the hon member mr strachan stop calling to each other across the house ?
in my term as councillor for vredendal we specifically spoke to v3 about tender documents for electrical works that would include black empowerment .
a comment was made in the standing committee regarding the department 's goal to strive for an effective and attainable public transport system .
the hon member is correct ; some of our roads are in a bad condition , and through no fault of the department .
it is being alleged that the building of new roads in many other provinces has led to the decay of road network maintenance .
] they needed to be supported , but now we have to expend money on maintenance for that school by way of putting in new cisterns !
one needs bank guarantees , which our people can never get , because they are red-lined by the banks .
i believe that that could have been more empowering , although the hon minister may tell me that the contrary is true .
we are now going to build the convention centre at which 200 to 300 cars are currently being parked , and then that parking space will also be gone .
madam chairperson , thank you very much for all the patience you have shown me , when this afternoon i simply walked past you .
secondly , increased competition for local businesses has resulted from foreign companies , due to south africa opening up to the global market .
customers are becoming increasingly demanding , not only demanding customised quality products , but also having a sharp eye towards the ethical and environmental aspects of companies ' production .
madam chairperson , it means if one wants to make money in that industry , one has to market one 's product like a hollywood movie .
the reason is that in our case the rise of the global knowledge economy was combined with the reintegration of south africa into the world economy .
we find here a focus on quality as a means to achieve competitive advantage , and an increased integration between manufacturing and service industries .
the classic dual role of government towards industry is to regulate and to extract taxes ; this is no longer adequate .
some of these agencies will be funded and created by the province while others fall within the terrain of other spheres of government .
however , there are also other policy objectives which the government must and can pursue in the course of utilising its property in the public interest .
there is indeed a variety of options that could be pursued and they vary from long-term leases to concessions and a large variety of ppps .
it is a step-by-step guide and i think it gives a simple but sound exposition of the entire tourist chain and where each role-player fits in .
it will be available at all tourist bureaux and lbscs , and with this booklet as a basis we are envisaging an entire series of workshops .
furthermore , as far as development is concerned , the tourism board has concluded a partnership with the development bank of southern africa in order to get practical community development projects off the ground .
the province has identified 52 pilot schools , at which a tourism awareness programme will be introduced for grades 1 , 2 and 3 from the second quarter of this year .
the focus of the board will be to provide support to emerging exporters , and to consolidate the export support thrusts through the province .
we hope to launch the newcape venture capital fund in the course of this financial year in cooperation with khula .
to date we have entered into funding agreements with eight service organisations , all of whom are affiliated to the western cape community-based paralegal association ( wesccopa ) .
despite improvements in the administration of the board , we still have a long way to go to full administrative efficiency .
the hon minister has tapped into two very critical issues relating to the role of government , and they are competence and of timing .
on 7 september 1999 the hon minister mentioned that we were applying for 200 section 28 ( 1 ) certificates per month .
in a debate on 7 march i asked a parliamentary question regarding how many section 28 ( 1 ) certificates we had received .
its wealth is to be found in its highly skilled labour force , its skills , its scenic beauty and its variety of tourist attractions , as well as its intensively developed agricultural activities .
i wish to emphasise that there is indeed something that causes me concern , namely the red tape we are still encountering in the province .
my experience of entrepreneurs and industrialists is that their biggest headache is the red tape that they have to endure when they wish to invest .
and then we have an insulting situation in scof where a member of the department says , " we are dangling it like a carrot .
" we are not sure whether this is a new form of performance appraisal or targeting or what , but we find it very insulting .
for the information of the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation , that structure is unrepresentative and it is dealing in the old way with liquor applications .
mr chairperson , the western cape has become a global player in a highly competitive market and the success that has been achieved is positive .
] the new national legislation will simply ignore the pleas of the community , churches and schools , and also the police input .
in connection with that , i would like to talk about the hon minister 's initiative around institutional restructuring , as he called it .
] this government , certainly as long as i am responsible for a part of it , is not going to specialise in that form of empowerment .
madam chairperson , in conclusion i would like to say that i was astonished to hear that the anc alliance was going to have another job summit .
these are the promotion of international competition ; services and assistance to new farmers ; the promotion of manual labour ; and the conservation of natural resources .
finally , investment immobility as a phenomenon represents the situation in which an investment decision in agriculture can usually be reversed only at very high cost .
despite the mysterious death of a horse in the malmesbury district earlier this year , animal health services has succeeded in controlling african horse disease in the province .
time and experience have taught that greater successes have been achieved where new farmers or communities also make a contribution towards their own agricultural development projects .
these projects boast the creation of job opportunities through activities such as contour building , fencing , tree-planting projects , conservation and the drainage of land .
roughly estimated , this programme will cost the province r40 million in contributions , but could create a huge safety net for the province .
on the one hand we mention that technology must be extended , but on the other we see a 5 % drop .
there is no problem discussing the fears and concerns and trying to find a middle way .
surely we know that it was the result of the support services provided by the apartheid government - soft loans , subsidies and ...
in addition , the national government recently displayed the policy trend not only to focus on subsistence farming but also to consider black commercial farming .
today workers are paid at post levels , and more than one farm has farm foremen who earn more than many people working in the towns .
apparently the national minister does not know that agricultural diesel can be distinguished or marked , like paraffin , so as not to mix it with diesel .
they must realise the disadvantage of the chickens we are getting from argentina and all those places who dump their chickens here .
that was after she had met janneman at a stage when she found it very difficult to get work .
when money is generated in agriculture , the greater percentage of the money goes to the workers , in contrast to the other industries .
to achieve this goal , more effective strategising with business and labour leaders of the western cape will remain a priority , and this is already taking place .
introducing biosphere technology to create a more harmonious balance between development and the environment , including river restoration and greening projects .
an exhibition of the famous austrian composer , anton brueckner , will be opened here by the governor of upper austria , dr joseph puehringer next month .
my ministry is already calling unannounced at various provincial facilities - as i will be doing myself , and more so than ever before .
having said this , mr speaker , i want to stress that the western cape government nevertheless believes in cooperative governance on all levels .
in only 40 days , between 1 december 1999 and 11 january this year , 914 people died in road accidents in south africa - 914 people !
the tremendous influx of people to this province , which has resulted in virtually uncontrolled squatting , poses a severe threat to our natural assets .
mr speaker , we have now really reached the crossroads as far as the stability of public transport facilities in the western cape is concerned .
they are being deprived of the right to get to their commitments or essential facilities such as hospitals and other essential service points , in time and in safety .
i also wish to thank my colleagues on this side of the house , messrs isaacs , ismail and winde , for their positive contribution and support .
this legislation is critical for government to show that we are in charge and that we can take up our rightful authority .
as far as the legalities of the legislation are concerned , we have analysed section 36 of the national constitution , which deals with the limitation of rights .
mr speaker , the people of the cape flats , and khayelitsha in particular , are being subjected to huge violations of their human rights .
mr speaker , like the previous speakers , the new np agrees that the western cape road transport act amendment bill should be welcomed .
the 51 days which have passed since the eruption of this crisis are 51 days of shame and neglect by the provincial government .
the minibus operators in guguletu and khayelitsha have no right to put up blockades to deny golden arrow the right to operate .
it is no longer the illegals versus the legals or vice versa . it is now the case of everybody fighting golden arrow .
he knows that hon member was the leader and is the one who most strongly supported the amendment by the hon minister .
i trust that within the next 48 hours the hon minister will declare those areas closed and therefore that the ranks are closed .
the chairperson of the standing committee on economic development asked me whether i wanted a good act or a half-baked one .
i thank him for having said that we should welcome the amendment bill so that we can regain stability in that area .
we shall continue to link directly and work with the good policemen and women so that we can begin to turn the thing around .
it may soothe our own conscience , but it cannot bring life to the limb bodies of chantine veldsman or clive mohammed .
he wants them to act against criminals , and yet he objects when i say , " act harshly against criminals " .
i often go to manenberg where i walk around , speak to people and go out with the police to see what they are doing .
we wish to ascribe the problem that we are faced with and that we are struggling with , to apartheid and to what happened in the apartheid era .
even though children at that time had no or limited rights , there were organisations in our liberation struggle which continuously fought for those rights for children .
even the hon member mr mckenzie , when he was minister of police , came out very boldly and declared war against crime .
] they came , and those same children that the member of judah speaks about , are the children who were incited against ...
many hon members of the house - not all - have fought for liberation and for peace , as spelt out in the freedom manifesto .
a closer examination of statistics shows that the most cases of crime and violence occur in the disadvantaged areas of the western cape .
most interesting of all is that the hon members messrs marais and isaacs are also falling into the same trap of blaming and complaining .
the people are demanding not just zero tolerance in the white areas but zero tolerance in all areas , particularly on the cape flats .
] with all due respect to the hon members messrs byneveldt and fransman , we must use our power - and we have a great deal of power .
according to the national minister of finance this is to be adjusted - hopefully it has now been adjusted , and i pray that it has been adjusted .
the point is , on the one hand zero tolerance is demanded - and some of the hon members have asked for zero tolerance .
] the investigating officer was outside his area for two days , and on the third day he returned and the man was arrested .
in the weekly reports that i receive i also get an intelligence report about all the events which will happen in the coming week .
l brown , e isaacs , p m jacobs , p j marais , n c phenduka , a e van zyl ( chairperson ) , a r winde
( i ) select committee amendments to national land transport transition bill [ b5a-2000 ] .
secondly , the anc wants to water down the function of parliament by suggesting that we are unable to authorise this expenditure .
that is the standpoint with which the new np , and i take it the dp , the acdp and the udm too , have no problems .
he cited a book by allen drury with a very good title , a very strange society - it sounded very nice .
] the dp are stealing their voters , and i am surprised that they have supported the new np in this process .
the destruction of the bad apple - the apple that is rotten to the core - will be my personal objective .
the request for assistance in this respect came from dr m p ncholo , the director-general of the department of public service and administration .
we also know that the dp and the new np did not support the registration process until it came to round 3 .
where is the pride of the public servants , who could not volunteer to do this task which is a national responsibility ?
yesterday the director-general pointed out to us that he had received representations from the central government to assist with the registration process .
but he knows that after those 430 volunteers were deducted from the total number of officials , we still needed 66 000 officials .
the real issue is that hon members are supposed to ask it here , but they know for a fact that the ...
i believe my friends across the floor are saying , " we are scared of what is happening with the registration of voters .
madam chairperson , it was not spent in accordance with each ministry 's line functions ; so how can their departments give account of the moneys ?
no matter what way the ministers respond to those matters , hon members can later take them up by way of formal questions or in other ways .
each hon minister gave authority for his department to give up the relevant sum of money in order to carry out that activity .
madam chairperson , our problem is we will not be in a position to exercise our rights as members here .
having heard everyone 's comments on this , i still say that we should adhere to committee stage procedure , as i mentioned earlier .
madam chairperson , i would like to know how many houses were not built as a result of r30 192,91 being allocated for this unauthorised expenditure ?
surely he should know how many people worked for the r30 000 , what they were paid and how long they worked .
madam chairperson , you will be pleased to know that i did not count each of the registration people individually .
madam chairperson , i accept the fact that the hon minister was not there , but he is politically responsible for the ministry .
has the hon minister got a special dispensation , because that must be what it is in order to deviate from the statutory ratio ?
madam chairperson , the money is statutory but no law can be made to keep people alive forever .
madam chairperson , on a point of order : that has nothing at all to do with the matter before the house .
madam chairperson , in response to the question , let me first of all say that the question on details of the finances is justified .
madam chairperson , i shall get the full details for the hon member ms essop and i will give them to the house .
i would not know where they worked , but it would have been at one of the polls where they were registering .
whether the hon minister feels the question is frivolous or not is a personal opinion , and even that is fine .
under which programme and subprogramme could that hon minister save in this financial year , given the health crisis , more that r0,5 million ?
could the hon minister give an indication - he surely must know - under which programme he could manage to save r35 000 ?
madam chairperson , i was not the responsible minister at the time , but with hindsight , yes , i would have preferred volunteers .
madam chairperson , the hon minister of education has said , to her credit , that she will condemn any utilisation of teachers for voter registration .
madam chairperson , the hon member mr ramatlakane is very fortunate ; he will get all the information exactly as he wants it .
i refer to vote 14 , programme transport : roads , r3 000 ; transport matters , r1 000 ; traffic safety , r1 000 ; construction , r1 000 ; and maintenance , r4 000 .
report of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling , on the western cape finance bill , [ b 1-2000 ] , dated 8 february 2000 , as follows :
our task in this province has to be to bring harmony so that our province does not play host to these extremes .
they include women who continue to be the victims of patriarchy , traditional systems , violent men and also sometimes their own internalised subservience .
the vision , as the hon minister of community safety once said , is mother 's milk - we all agree it is good .
i would like to emphasise to the hon premier that government has to be about taking the good with the bad .
i have a sense of urgency to see growth , development and progress in the province in the department of social services and poverty relief .
for the hon premier the most important objective is that the province of the western cape should develop so that people can reap the fruits of its development .
mr speaker , it is the police act , which the anc amended , that allows for the creation of municipal police throughout the country .
it is clear that there is an overlap between the pledges made by the anc and the priorities of the government .
it is a fact that poverty impacts mainly , although not exclusively , on the african and coloured people as well as the rural poor .
] the judge said - and this is the most damning indictment of their record of delivery - and i quote :
] no , the delivery of the hon premier has not enhanced the reputation of the western cape as a stable and successful province .
the anc constituency offices are now being faced with calls on a day by day basis from tenants who face rapidly escalating rentals .
i can tell the anc that if there were a by-election in crossroads in 18 months , they would not win .
in fact , the people now know that they have absolutely nothing to gain through the failed promises of the anc government .
when people ask me why we have such high pupil : teacher ratios , i point to this sort of dismal abuse , which the anc is always quiet on .
even the status that mr tony leon has commanded abroad clearly indicates the behaviour of someone who projects himself as an alternative .
mr speaker , let me repeat that no one on this side of the house is dividing the people of the western cape along racial lines .
as mentioned by the hon minister of community safety , through a well-planned and systematic process we can root this cancer out of our daily lives .
i would also like to echo the sentiments of the hon minister and extend my gratitude and appreciation to all the traffic police in the province .
the tourism-related community of knysna have received a large morale boost for this and will become an even bigger player in the tourism industry .
we have canal walk and grandwest , but he forgets to say that they are all concentrated on the north-west economic line .
as the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs says , it is the lotto 's fault that this government has to decrease the existing state maintenance grants !
] i want to give hon members of the anc the assurance that development in the rural areas can never be achieved without agriculture .
mr speaker , that is what we interpreted the hon minister as saying at the time when he responded to our questions .
again , what we are not being told is that the people that are stopping the development are people from the unati section .
it is always a pleasure to come back , because being on the outside looking in also inevitably develops its own perspectives .
this is one of the reasons why this country 's share of direct foreign investment is on a downward curve .
] in the western cape , however , these actions appear to be acceptable to the hon premier , his minister and the rest of his coalition government .
mr speaker , before coming to my reply , i want to wish everyone in the house everything of the best for the year that lies ahead .
the argentine , which is one of our strongest competitors in international agriculture , focused specifically on the skills of their rural population .
it is with shock that the agricultural community of the western cape hears week after week about the murders that are taking place on our farms .
sir , in the meantime the agricultural industry is anxiously awaiting the budget speech by the national minister of finance , which he will deliver on 21 february 2001 .
it is with shock that we heard last year about a rise of 37c per litre in the price of diesel .
the government of this province has taken the decision to supplement farm workers ' income in the drought-stricken areas of the southern cape .
they derive comfort from the fact that the da constantly derides labour legislation that seeks to protect people in vulnerable situations .
therefore , the hiv / aids debate for the western cape is not about drugs alone , as the hon leader of the opposition said .
if counsellors ask them about it , they want to know why they should believe what the doctors say if the president does not believe in aids .
mr speaker , i am very sorry that i have to speak at this late stage , but it was the decision of the whips .
they fail time and again , and time and again they put the blame on him , and then they have a bosberaad and after that he is wonderful again .
it will be funded by my department and conducted in collaboration with clinical experts in our academic hospitals , and medicine sans frontiers .
particularly here in our first world / third world situation in south africa we should be vulnerable if research and development of new medicine were to begin to dry up .
the hon minister of health also referred to the tremendous expenditure at academic hospitals which is cause for grave concern for all of us .
this is quite clearly what happened last year with the r400 paid to the 5 290 farm workers .
if we are able to get approximately r100 million a year , it is important that we see that the casino works and that it is secure .
mr speaker , i accept and i agree - i am on their side 100 % , just for one second that is , ...
however , the hon member should also remember that we are dealing with the second reading debate ; we are not accepting the report as such .
the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism referred to the fact that , to the best of my knowledge , a separate institution was created there .
i thought he said r13 million , but i might be wrong , in addition to the money that the province paid .
if an hon member would like to ask a further question of any of the other ministers on a particular point , they can do that .
the draft bill has now been returned by the department of planning , governmental affairs and housing and will be tabled very shortly .
they will be allocated interdepartmentally and i believe that the hon minister of transport , sport and recreation will play a very important role in that regard .
to begin with , sir , we wish to convey our sincere sympathy and compassion to those who have lost loved ones in the taxi conflict .
mr speaker , on a point of order : i had expected that the hon member mr isaacs would do it with your ruling .
for instance , when we look at golden arrow , we see that just within the last month golden arrow has lost r7,5 million in revenue .
is it because it is affecting a section of the population of this province who are not very important to the western cape government ?
] why does she not say that a little later this week we would like to debate this western cape issue in that house .
there i have a problem , because the manner in which they structure many of these operations undermines service delivery of the police in other areas .
they are also under threat of retrenchment and short time if bus routes are not normalised ; and township drivers have had to flee their homes as well .
last year the taxi ranks were closed for two months , the industry was cleaned up , peace was restored and the transport system is in operation .
however , i have also said publicly that i am open to discussing the merits of opening the slps .
last week , on friday , 2 june 2000 , i opened the first provincial cooperative for taxis and buses in this province .
( 1 ) the provincial minister of health requests the national minister of health to carry out a thorough health inspection at pma ;
amongst others , after long research , the preferred site was identified as that on the foreshore , both from a transport point of view and from a location point of view .
the hon member mr n m isaacs tried to say here that the shareholder agreement is separate from the legislation we are dealing with here .
mr speaker , convenco adopted the kpmg recommendations and requested each of its shareholders to contribute r60 million towards the capital costs .
i think we will need some sort of unique selling point over and above the unsurpassed natural beauty that this province enjoys .
in the committee meeting i asked the hon minister of finance and development planning who on the board had a conflict of interests .
the suspensive clauses kick in on 6 december 2000 , and if the land ownership issue is not sorted out , it will be a problem .
i would like to make the house aware of the fact that we are also going to move an amendment in that regard during the committee stage .
i think that i have dealt with the cape international convention centre company bill in detail , and therefore i need not elaborate on it further .
i must just tell her that in cases like that or in legal interpretation one always looks at the intention of the drafters .
those authorities have jointly agreed to make the land available - as a public contribution - on a lease basis to the company .
that extension will probably require , in time - it could be three years , five years or ten years - a contribution by this government .
the directors themselves can do all that they can , but they cannot bind other public authorities which have independent mandates .
if we do not obtain agreement in the house , we will put the clauses to the vote and we will then have to vote on them .
in terms of the convenco agreement or purchasing equity in convenco in terms of the shareholders agreement , the provincial minister of finance may only appropriate funds ...
nothing prevents the provincial government from , at any time , making further contributions to or purchasing additional equity in convenco .
i would really urge the hon member ms essop to withdraw the amendment because there is no hidden agenda .
madam chairperson , shall i deal with the issue of clarity first and then give my motivation , or shall i give my motivation now ?
you have given hon members the right in terms of the procedures to give a motivation , but we are now moving into a discussion .
i am asking for clarity on the matter and i am giving hon members an opportunity to address me on this matter .
i am hoping that the deputy secretary will return in a short while so that we can resolve the matter , but i think the amendment should be put .
vote 6 - health ( auditor-general 's report [ pr2 / 2000 - pages 6 and 7 , paragraph 3.5 ] ) : stock
notwithstanding this , the committee recommends that the amount of r29 985 be authorised by the provincial parliament , as no misappropriations have been revealed .
furthermore , the constitution of the republic of south africa provides in section 155 ( 2 ) that national legislation defines the various types of municipalities .
not only have whites left the new np , which has led to those hon members making a decision like this .
the hon minister of local government in his wisdom has decided , for example , that category a municipalities should function with a collective executive system .
at first the anc boycotted the standing committee meetings and then they realised they had made a mistake and should come back quickly .
the point is that we fully support the hon minister in regard to this bill , and in the end that will prevail .
mr speaker , i shall try to keep my speech brief and i hope to bring a little calm back to the house .
the policy formulation process for this legislative framework started in april 1997 with the publication of a discussion document by the national government .
this is an indication that it is very difficult for us to trust the new np or its coalition partner with the constitutional principles that are established .
when a system of executive mayor is introduced , it is a universal principle that the occupant of the office is directly elected by the electorate .
this is an inclusive approach which would seek to accommodate all rather than exclude so many .
no , the hon member mr byneveldt will not get away with it by turning his back on me and continuing to talk .
] strangest of all is that that same judiciary that is humiliated in this house , is praised when mr williams is found guilty .
does the hon minister of health want to give the hon member mr r williams the opportunity to deliver his speech now , or does he wish to proceed ?
we certainly will not be lectured on the independence of the judiciary and how we can and should not criticise .
however , we cannot run away from the fact that during the apartheid era people were judged on the basis of their colour and background .
in conclusion , mr speaker , still referring to this judgment , the fact is that we ordinary people rely on the judicial system .
yet they come to the house without being able to give us one example of how the anc has interfered with judgments .
i would like to refer to statements allegedly made by the anc criticising the dr allan boesak judgment .
does the hon member mr lewis want us to interfere with the judgment of dr allan boesak and change that judgment ?
i am pleased that hon members on that side of the house are saying today that there is a difference between interference and criticism .
] this became our slogan , even as far as our congress was concerned , that we should give the coloured people a place under the sun .
i remember the time before that hon member and all the other coloured hon members in this house became involved in politics .
mr speaker , it was not the white afrikaners that moved into bishopscourt , an area which had belonged to our people .
that is all the hon member mr mckenzie 's speech has been about , and he has brought apartheid politics into the anc with a vengeance .
the new np has rejected and apologised for apartheid , and certainly also the hon members on this side of the house .
it matters that she belongs to the right party , that she has the right chromosomes and that she has the right number of ...
mr speaker , this country could win if it were not for the sacp / anc obsession with power .
tony leon and his lieutenants , ever more confident of their ability to wipe out the nnp and now circling for the kill .
the way the anc sees it is that there are two basic choices that the new np must face up to .
a glance at the 1999 election results in places like durbanville , monte vista , bellville and parow shows that this choice is a foregone conclusion .
] it is people like her that made me realise that i would never ever want to walk the path that she walks .
we fought so hard against this repressive state that mowed down whole villages , allocated state resources along racial lines and created bantustans .
mr speaker , i am saying here today that it has nothing to do with whether one is in the coalition or not .
the khula funding , which is directed towards small and medium enterprises , has not been a huge success story because the targeted market has not been reached .
this fund is regarded as a breakthrough in the provision of risk capital for previously disadvantaged owners and managers of these enterprises and projects .
however , it would be irresponsible to compel banks at this juncture to grant loans to small businesses without a guarantee of risk alleviation .
for the record , the picture revealed in the public statement made by the dp was one of opportunism .
the dp believe that the payback will be that the black contractors will possibly vote for the dp in the coming local government elections .
one sees empowerment being lost and being replaced by so-called " fronting " which the hon member ms essop spoke about .
there is a major focus on smmes and this document is a major step in the right direction and i fully support it .
it is a circular argument , and it shows the mindset that the hon member mr r williams spoke about that is essentially eurocentric .
if the socio-economic objectives of our country are in favour of smmes , we cannot allow the banks to sabotage that process .
( v ) portfolio committee amendments to local government : municipal electoral bill [ b35a-2000 ] .
( d ) this matter might have been avoided if the department had followed a more pro-active process with regard to its duplicating requirements ;
vote 7 - corporate services ( auditor-general 's report [ pr 124 / 1999 - page 4 , paragraph 3.4 ] ) : consultants
in spite of the technical support for the accuracy of the voters ' roll by the valuation profession at the time , the dp challenged the general valuation .
while their rates bill has increased the services they have received have deteriorated , are offered less frequently or have stopped altogether .
they have no empathy and no understanding of people other than the privileged communities in pinelands , constantia and hout bay that they represent .
they were entitled to do it , but they never sought any directive from the then administrators to do that .
what i am concerned about is that this piece of legislation which will be enabling legislation for the metropolitan area will only be implemented next year .
madam speaker , we must appreciate that the important point here is not so much a matter of what appears in the act .
now the anc is trying to point a finger at other parties and to say that it is the other parties that have not provided the services .
it is not only the owners that become victims during farm attacks but also the farm workers and the visitors .
the editorial of die burger of 10 august 2000 , under the heading , " nog plaasmoorde " , emphasises the horrific farm murders that are currently taking place .
this house wants to congratulate the saps on their rapid action in this instance , in which the attackers were detained only a few hours after the murders .
accordingly it is required of us to rearrange our agricultural production systems and take innovative action in order to ensure the best quality products .
to conclude , madam speaker , stability in the rural areas is in the direct interest of south africa and all its law-abiding citizens .
a stable and productive farming community is in a certain sense an extension of the state 's visible authority and order in the rural areas .
what is more , the media could also reinforce the perception that farm murders are necessarily a black : white phenomenon , or that they are a labourer : farm owner phenomenon .
often it is difficult to answer that , because the hon minister is so quiet that i cannot even quote him .
" i do not know whether any of the hon members in those benches considered themselves the peanut gallery .
this enables the board to expose potential cheating or other related irregularities on an almost continuous basis .
firstly , that the spm was functioning without a qualified building control officer and , secondly , that plans were being passed without the consent of a qualified building control officer .
the second issue was that the former minister of community safety , sport and recreation resigned from the provincial cabinet on 22 july 2000 .
therefore , i request the hon premier and the new np in terms of their track record not to allow this .
] however , i do not want to spend too much time on the hon member mr mckenzie , because we have known him for so long .
mr speaker , i withdraw it , but i will say it outside in the street as well and the hon member knows why .
i have attempted to obtain a copy of the forensic audit report which was compiled by a firm of auditors for the south peninsula municipality .
mr speaker , i will not spend the taxpayers ' money in this province unnecessarily if i do not have to .
the hon member mr ozinsky cannot misuse a point of order to make a speech or quote something .
mr speaker , the hon minister wrote an affidavit , took it to the board and had it approved unanimously , according to him .
that meeting took place on 10 april 2000 and , what is more , the hon minister was chairing the meeting where the objection was made .
he deliberately misrepresented himself to the public and he is standing a long way from the truth on this matter .
it is their right to do so , but i think that we are beginning to see the slip of inconsistency showing .
mr speaker , on a point of order : there is a convention in the house to refer to other members as members .
] i would appeal to the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism to refer to all members as members .
in my letter i specifically pointed out the company which had , and i quote , " hotel and leisure interests " .
owerhede het die reg om aanspraak te maak op ' n intelligensiediens se tydige en onkreukbare hantering van inligting sodat vertroue gevestig kan word .
mr speaker , if an intelligence service knows that very important people are going to appear somewhere , surely someone is placed in charge of their protection .
mr speaker , as things stand there can be absolutely no moral justification for the planting of bombs in a country like this one .
every act of racism should be seen as a crime against mankind and not a crime against the anc per se .
again they failed to elect or nominate a black person , but we will never accuse them of racism .
i want to warn that chorus of voices who say that there are no africans in the western cape cabinet to think carefully .
if the president and deputy president can represent coloured people , why can the peter maraises and the patrick mckenzies not represent blacks ?
] mr speaker , we have quoted the words , " the anc women in the national assembly add no value .
the anc studiously ignores these examples in order to build a race-based pact to take power in the western cape .
] the party 's leadership actively encourages a policy of blaming whites or martians or aliens when anything goes wrong !
secondly , it removes the moral responsibility for dealing with racism and racial inequalities from the primary beneficiaries of apartheid .
the americans were prepared to take hands - and when i speak about " taking hands " i mean really taking hands .
( 3 ) that time should be allocated for this debate , although the views / claims of william cooper are not important ;
( 1 ) calls on the premier to inform the house of the reasons for this unilateral decision ; and
the president appealed to the farm workers and the members of the anc there to help if any attack on a farmer took place .
i take pleasure in doing so because i stand here this afternoon as one who grew up on a farm and worked very closely with workers and labourers on the farm .
the challenge faced by the employer and the employee in the agricultural industry in the western cape is the maintenance of sound value systems .
his uncle died on a farm in the paarl district and he as the immediate next-of-kin was refused permission to make the funeral arrangements .
intensifying the rural safety protection plan and improving rapid response systems for protecting isolated areas with better equipment .
furthermore i want to refer to a farm on the west coast called volvlei , belonging to the hon member ms rossouw ; ...
mr speaker , the hon member mr dugmore 's statement that farm workers are attacked and evicted is a haphazard statement with no grounds .
mr speaker , in mossel bay there have been no convictions on a charge of assault over the past four years and one case of eviction is pending .
however , i think we should respect agreements that the whips come to , and in particular the agreement which they have come to in this regard .
( iv ) portfolio committee amendments to transnet pension fund amendment bill [ b57a-2000 ] .
in terms of rule 134 of the standing rules of the western cape provincial parliament , i hereby withdraw the western cape tourism bill [ b8-2000 ] .
( v ) south african rail commuter corporation limited financial arrangements bill [ b64-2000 ] .
in evidence the department admitted that the non-compliance with procurement prescriptions was mainly due to new staff and the lack of training .
( vi ) portfolio committee amendments to bills of exchange amendment bill [ b47a-2000 ] .
( x ) select committee amendments to national health laboratory service bill [ b52a-2000 ] .
( xiv ) select committee amendments to construction industry development board bill [ b59a-2000 ] .
according to the auditor-general 's report , the department purchased curtains to the value of r22 723 without having followed the prescribed tender board procedures .
in evidence the department admitted that the non-compliance with procurement prescriptions was mainly due to new staff and the lack of training .
report of the public service commission on the state of representativeness in the public service .
this is the main reason why i called the coalition members to order in this house yesterday , in order to respect the rulings of the chairperson .
if it amounts to a direct questioning of the chair and criticism of the chair , then it must be by way of a motion .
mr speaker , i want to ask the hon minister of social services and poverty relief whether he says that it was unjust ...
mr speaker , what we witnessed in the house yesterday was an unbelievable display of incompetency on the part of the cabinet .
not only was it a display of incompetency , but a display of complete disregard for the parliamentary process in the house .
mr speaker , on a point of order : is it parliamentary to refer to an hon member as a scoundrel ?
mr speaker , the hon minister of finance and development planning said that we were guilty of filibustering ; the exact opposite was true .
] that is the answer , and therefore i have much pleasure in moving the third reading of the bill .
mr speaker , this is a matter which i have specifically put on the budget council meeting agenda , because central government ...
the following votes - once again , well done to the hon minister of transport and works - also received additional allocation out of surpluses .
mr speaker , i would like to move this motion , emphasising the word " that " , which i have included this time .
mr speaker , a certain hon member in the house said , " i am the premier of all ...
do hon members really think that the hon premier is the premier of all the constituents in the province , as he claims he is ?
mr speaker , on a point of order : i want to remind the speaker that i am not yet in the chair .
i conclude that the hon premier does not regard the people in those constituencies as important enough to be taken care of .
uthi ke ngoko ahambe namathile lawo aye edla-keni elo aye kubeka ilitye , hayi ukuba avele avunguze ahambe neentatheli zamaphephandaba kuba ejonge inzuzo yezopolitiko .
however , they are opposed to soccer - read " overwhelmingly black audiences " - in other words , soccer being played at newlands .
however , it is not my intention to get involved in replying to the debate because that is not my function .
we in this province are going to look after all our people - not only those who have friends in the right places .
mr speaker , the voters of the western cape have spoken and it is now our duty to get on with the job .
it is a serious offer aimed at obtaining the best possible result for all the citizens of the western cape .
perhaps we can find some place to spend the r10 million in the office of the director-general that is continuously being rolled over .
i would like the educationists on that side of the house to tell me what they think the number of exemptions were .
the gangsterism has become worse , the drug taking and selling have become worse and the hopelessness of the citizens has become worse .
part of our allocation , that is r20 000 , will therefore be used towards transporting children from disadvantaged backgrounds to these events .
perhaps the hon premier requires a geography lesson on the western cape and perhaps , like the rest of his party , he is wishing us away .
the three priority points of the hon minister of community safety can and will only succeed if the youth on the cape flats are accommodated .
the average weekly death-toll in gang-infested elsies river , bonteheuwel and mitchells plain makes a mockery of their so-called commitment to combating crime .
nor is it interesting and complex because of what of the da say , but because of what their intentions are .
the radio advertisements by the da with loud sirens implied that if one did not vote , the kaffirs would rule the western cape .
the hon member mr fransman was making an assertion , which represented his point of view , and the chair cannot rule on that .
mr speaker , it is very clear that the hon member mr king does not know what the word " implied " means .
mr speaker , finally i want to deal with the question of rural development , which was the fourth priority of the hon premier .
when are they going to apologise to those parents who never saw their children again after they had gone to the quattro camps ?
that is why the people of bonteheuwel are telling him that he was actually lucky to get 21 % of the vote .
however , it does not make sense to me when i find three young girls walking around in their school uniforms in elsies river at 10 : 00 .
they know that unemployment is the major cause of the non-payment of school fees and that actions which deny pupils access to education are unacceptable .
i sent these girls back to school with a letter and a copy of the schools act to be handed to the principal .
the hon member mr dugmore 's suggestion that this government has broken its promises and failed to deliver was particularly ludicrous .
mr speaker , let me now turn to some of the comments made by the hon leader of the opposition .
] i wonder if he has the courage to take this concern for the poor to the national leadership of his own party .
mr speaker , when i first saw the response of the hon minister to this letter i was shocked beyond belief .
i have since shown the response to several muslim leaders in the western cape and i have discussed it with many of my jewish friends .
on the basis of that the woman decided that harold cressy was a muslim school and she would not send her child there .
mr speaker , in her letter the hon minister admits that she has not heard the other side .
i hope that she has the guts to take on the hon minister and challenge her in court regarding this matter .
mr speaker , it now becomes clear why tony leon objected so vehemently to the letter quoted by president mbeki .
the acdp would like to highlight two areas mentioned by the hon premier in his opening address , the first of which is regionalisation .
mr speaker , an extremely critical moment has arrived in the life of the western cape and in the lives of its people in particular .
stop crying , make our streets safe , stop our journeys to hospital and the cemetery - that is the cry on everyone 's lips .
does one then have to be white in this province to get the attention of the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation ?
these incidents explain the story on the cape flats , but then people talk about " political will " - just like that !
now the hon premier comes and talks wildly about the drug problem in the western cape , as if this were not a chapter from our history book .
the legal opinion given to the government states quite clearly that the government , if requested by the iec , may give assistance .
i am not only mentioning social grants , but also the housing aspect , because it all falls within the ambit of social services .
we want to prove to them that in the june 1999 elections the western cape people showed that they wanted to be ruled by the anc .
do not use racist rhetoric to attack the hon premier 's opening address or this coalition - attack our performance .
mr speaker , if i may , i would like for a moment to respond to the hon leader of the opposition 's address yesterday .
we are all patriots and proud to be south africans and we can all take credit for the achievements of the western cape .
as for the tremendous influx of people to which the hon premier referred , i agree with him that we should look at it .
the influx across the borders is not just a problem for the western cape , as the hon member ms vantura reported .
she should not let them do to her what they did to the former minister of social services and poverty relief .
mr speaker , now i come to the cooperation with the department of home affairs and the iec which this province is pursuing .
how many times do we have to hear that the police services are in short supply of everything , from stationery to vehicles and even to fuel for their vehicles ?
in part , these skills and expertise are being harnessed through business against crime , but the dp believes that this relationship can and should be extended .
madam speaker , she then gave her version of why we were experiencing so many job losses in the mining industry , and again i quote :
what is required , in short , is a new breed of detective , who sees himself as an interface between social fabric and the institution of law enforcement .
the hon minister in the office of the premier had no business plan , so she had to transfer r1 million for voter registration .
mr speaker , before i begin my prepared speech , i would just like to correct something which my colleague quoted here .
i want to say that we on this side of the house have seen the course that the anc wants taken for the municipal election .
that discussion and the conclusions drawn will have a very profound impact on the future of the people in the province .
the anc has moved a motion of no confidence , but this is really not a debate to be resolved in the house .
it is quite clear , then , that if there is not a demonstration happening in front of parliament , the anc no longer has a voice .
i would like to start by responding to what the hon minister in the office of the premier said in her speech .
mr speaker , i would like to link the scourge of racism to another scourge in this province - the scourge of child abuse .
he said that he was going to deal with racism by dealing with anybody who raised any racist issues or uttered any racist words .
the mail & guardian , which strongly supported the anc in the last election , commented as follows , and i quote :
the human rights commission 's intervention will restore the right to education to thousands of farm school pupils in the eastern cape .
my office has the responsibility to activate , coordinate , monitor and evaluate the process of transformation ...
mr speaker , the fact is that the 5 % that the hon premier was talking about are those people that i have mentioned now .
there is not a word to say that it will continue so that the poorest of the poor can have legal representation .
he said that if the department of justice had sent me that letter , he would take it up with eshaam mohamed immediately .
mr speaker , i think that as part of the transformation process i must teach you how to pronounce my surname !
those promises quite rightly brought hope to people who had been deeply humiliated by the social conditions to which social injustice had consigned them .
the minister of housing said yesterday that there used to be 2 million farm workers in this country , and now there are 500 left .
when the dp visited mitchells plain we discovered that they have 1 police station and 1 satellite station serving 2 million people .
on any one night one can expect to find about 10 police officers on duty and several officers absent on sick leave .
in the meantime , workers have lost their jobs , employers have been liquidated , we are having social problems in the rural areas and children are not getting their schooling .
madam speaker , while we might say that our country has no money , we are giving r800 million to a chaotic government in zimbabwe , ...
we are still waiting for a yes or no to our request of 20 july 1999 , while our citizens are experiencing the worst natural disasters ever .
hon members should generally try to keep their voices lower than that of the person who is speaking .
if he were still in charge of that portfolio today , there would be no metro casino licence for another two or three years .
this latest budget documentation will form the basis upon which this house will need to debate and vote on the budget i am tabling today .
following on this , the shares among the provinces are decided by a combination of a formula-driven process and national functional and political objectives .
equity redress within the health system must operate through budget adjustments in the same manner as the equitable share mechanisms to provinces .
] that is why i need the hon member to check on me ; the hon member must be razor-sharp !
the process has been further complicated by the steady decline in health patient fees from r84 million in the 1995-96 financial year to r65 million in the 1999-2000 financial year .
mr speaker , it is traditional for me to thank a number of people , and i do so with all the sincerity at my command .
mr speaker , i would like to express my sincere sympathy to the people of mozambique who have suffered so greatly in the floods .
i would like to congratulate the springbok cricket team on their historic victory in india , the first time in 13 years by an overseas team .
lastly , it was only after several requests that an inside service by service officers became available - for one day only !
indeed , the provisions which aim to stimulate and advance a closer conjoining of policy development , medium-term planning and budgeting have been pursued .
last year i visited , among other places , elim in the overberg to look at unemployment and projects to address it .
those people are suffering hardship because officials who draw fat salaries every month have not yet got so far as to take a decision .
it has been mentioned here before , but the new np will continue to repeat it until sufficient attention is devoted to this matter .
mr speaker , it is true that the greater part of the budget , 95 % , is devoted to education , health and social services .
we hope it is simply forgetfulness rather than a lack of commitment to the work and accountability and transparency of the standing committee .
quite frankly - as we have heard - they have ignored the historical circumstances and have constantly dealt with the odious comparisons .
if we look at all the financial transactions that take place nationally , we will see that at this level r33 trillion 's worth of finances are involved .
the hon premier must be assured of our support in this regard even if that is the only string that the anc can harp on .
however , they stand in the queues only to hear that there is no work for steel fixers when they know there is plenty of work .
we today have the new converts to the mtef and the reprioritisation that goes with it , to fiscal discipline and forward planning and to equity .
the hon member mr gabru regularly mentions the example of the amalgamation of schools and then refers to the schools at lamberts bay .
it is their obligation , therefore , in representing 42 % of the voters in this province , to be part of the budgetary process .
much has been said at scof and in the press as well , in an attack on my colleague here , about the r10 million for poverty relief .
i have gone out of my way at every opportunity to point that out , whether at the budget council or in the ncop .
the employment equity act calls on each and every provincial policy framework , management planning initiative , operational plan and so on to address the long-term reform objectives .
i do know that my friend the leader of the house believes that it is unconstitutional , but if they want to see it they can have a look at it .
some of these successes have been : theft of medical supplies in the form of syndicate activities has increased tremendously over the past three years .
the results of the recent census , which states that we have miraculously lost 161 000 people , have been phased into the calculations up to the 2003 budget .
allowing for the effects of inflation the western cape 's share will effectively be reduced by 9 % , says idasa 's information service .
it is like robbing peter to feed paul , whilst paul sends his children to eat at peter 's table .
the reason for the exception is that external inputs will be pivotal and because the budget allocation is one of the most contentious issues .
the third matter i want to rectify concerns the poverty alleviation desk and the statement that there is no poverty or business plan .
the inclusion of the former department of corporate services as a branch in a new department under the leadership of the director-general is well-known .
madam chairperson , i am convinced that it is this very model of corporate service which enables our province to stand head and shoulders above the others .
one of the presenters was a canadian practitioner and professor of law , prof phillip knight , who is an esteemed international drafting expert .
mothers still do not receive support from the authorities and the police when they go to seek assistance to get their daughters back .
she said that if a colleague gets shot , she is required to perform first aid and resuscitation procedures .
in conclusion , like the hon premier , i too would like to say a few words about the internal audit service in the office of the auditor-general .
we in this parliament should also take an interest in securing advantages for ourselves beyond the confines of our provincial borders .
firstly , i would like to congratulate the hon premier on his outward approach regarding regionalisation and his focus on intergovernmental relations .
however , i would like to refer to the second paragraph under vote 1 in the report of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling .
in the province we have had a huge increase in the incidence of tb , which is a socio-economic illness that only the poor suffer from .
mr chairperson , i just want to make a few comments on what has been said here , particularly by the hon member ms vantura .
on 17 may 1996 , in a letter to the mec from themba sikhutshwa , provincial secretary of the anc youth league , he denied these undertakings .
i just hope that all those hon members sitting in the front benches who made snide comments will ask for speaking time in the debate .
that the r 770 000 budgeted for political parties in respect of clerical assistance be referred to the rules committee for review .
- the staff establishment of each department , - revenue generated by each department , and - key government outcomes , geographic distribution of services , core functions and strategic activities .
that is mainly for technical reasons , to obviate the need for further typesetting after the initial typing of the speeches .
if committee chairpersons have enquiries about procedure , they can , of course , be addressed through the office of the speaker or the office of the deputy speaker .
it is myth that a parliament that is not visitor-friendly can ever grow in the hearts of the people that it has to serve .
madam chairperson , my concluding sentence is that the code of conduct , as the speaker has mentioned , has to include the question of a declaration of assets .
this clustering means that committee coordinators and committee clerks must service a number of subcommittees , and that leads to a severe lack of capacity in those committees .
i am therefore grateful that i was only called upon to defend the budget at this stage , at which we are scoring many positive points .
the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling recommended as long ago as 1997 that they should be involved only in the global picture .
] the hon member mr a lewis 's good fortune , though , is that he alone decides on how that money is to be utilised .
] the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs stated quite clearly that it was a fact-finding mission .
mr speaker , both the hon member mr isaacs and the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs are not understanding the issue at all .
therefore , the government are not only knowingly doing something that is wrong , but their intentions in this initiative are also known .
( i ) the commissioning of research into the impact of globalisation on our provincial economy and a proposed strategy to deal with this .
exhibit found on scene , which is a can with blue liquid , and forwarded to the sa police services forensic laboratory for analysis .
neither the department of housing nor the provincial housing board has identified national , provincial or municipal land suitable for low-cost or social housing .
consumer tribunal r 526 000 consumer education 676 000 attending to complaints 946 000 consumer liaison 214 000 r 2 322 000
the department funds some of the offices of this organisation to ensure service delivery and distribution of information relevant to consumer-related matters .
( 3 ) i will make introductory remarks at the celebration of world consumer rights day , that is , for everybody 's information , on 15 march 2000 .
as with all other aspects of this policy , and entirely predictably since it was introduced in 1996 , it has caused chaos in education .
if it is used in a derogatory way to address another hon member , then it is certainly not acceptable .
( b ) a 100 % pass rate has been averaged over the past three years by candidates who attended the college .
its implementation is therefore a co-responsibility of the current department of planning , local government and housing , the local authority and my department .
i said to them that i find it unacceptable that there has not been any follow-up in the six years between 1993 and 1999 .
hon members ' attention is drawn to the fact that in terms of section 14 of the land use planning ordinance , 1985 ( ordinance 15 of 1985 ) :
if the hon member knew more about the act , he would know that the organisations he mentioned could not nominate anybody .
( 2 ) who is responsible for the decisions about which cultural organisations can receive financial support and how are these decisions made / taken ;
( 2 ) the tabling of a report is dependent on the reasons to be provided by the chairperson of the western cape provincial tender board .
those who cannot afford it can then get to the " voorbrandfees " in 18 to 20 of our towns in the southern cape .
the decision taken in the standing committee meeting this morning was that what we really need is an intervention from the hon premier himself .
it would in any event have been appropriate if the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation had given such an undertaking .
recently , whoever , during the bus blockade on , inter alia , the n1 , the n2 and the r300 , he suddenly had a lot of powers .
if i remember rightly , it cost approximately r7 million and in the process they paid a great deal of attention to the western cape .
this would also indicate that there are amongst the members of this provincial parliament - excluding the cabinet - african people as well .
mr speaker , as a follow-up question , could the hon premier indicate to the house who is investigating the frieda adams / tonka bosman incident ?
] we understand that things are hidden and we understand that they are merely trying to ensure that this incident dies a death just like all the other incidents .
since it is an inclusive process , i want to take the opportunity to lend my full support to the initiative .
these regulations were enforced in a joint operation undertaken by personnel of the saps , the sandf , the provincial traffic police and municipal traffic police officers .
bus drivers and passengers were intimidated , shot at , injured and murdered , thus causing trauma to all their families .
since 1 april 1999 the wced implemented a policy to close small schools with fewer than 25 learners and to implement a transport scheme .
we also have a hostel subsidy , so children can decide whether they want to use the transport service or stay in a hostel .
mr speaker , by the time the documents come to me for signature most of those problems have been resolved .
mr speaker , lambert 's bay also , of course , has its own dynamics primarily because the anc is using the schools there as a platform for ...
obviously he would know that the decision to place a satellite station is not mine but that of the provincial commissioner , indeed .
mr speaker , it is part of the report and it will be available when it is tabled in parliament .
mr speaker , i must congratulate the department on the work they have put in during the last two weeks on operation backlog .
] it is the case that the western cape has its own constitution , in which we refer to " parliament " and " ministers " .
my department is currently actively involved with quite a number of agricultural projects aimed at empowering disadvantaged communities , groups and individuals .
mr speaker , i gave the hon member mr ramatlakane the undertaking that we would accommodate the questions today as far as possible .
( 3 ) why he has been unable to fulfil the undertakings that he made in his 100-day speech ?
we relate this to the fact that hiv disease is now having an adverse effect on the prevalence of tb in our province .
as it happens , we have made good progress on all the initiatives which i announced , in fact , we are already nearly 80 % there with all of them .
performance management agreements for the level of directors and above are in place and the health facilities boards bill is en route to the cabinet .
what was warming to hear is that the department recently was judged the annual best performing provincial department by the professional management review .
mr speaker , i am not aware of any investigations , and if there have been it will be totally against policy .
it is anticipated that a white paper in this connection can be finalised and published early in 2001 , whereafter appropriate legislation will be introduced .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon premier what he has done to solve the problems in this province ?
there has also been information that people commuting from delft are using the subsidised khayelitsha bus tickets which are not meant for use in delft .
mr speaker , my information is that transport subsidy moneys have not been put to good use , that there is a degree of corruption and that corrupt practices are taking place .
sir , to come back to the corruption to which the hon member mr ramatlakane referred , i have just said that this is being investigated .
i would also like to point out that the tender closed on 8 september 2000 and it is currently in the process of evaluation .
i have been waiting since february - and it is now september , nearly october - and those regulations have still not been promulgated .
i have no connection whatsoever with any control of the v & a waterfront hotel or the day-to-day management of the hotel .
mr speaker , i note that the hon member mr stali is not in the house , but i shall nevertheless answer the question .
four capacity building programmes were provided to departmental representatives on understanding the integrated national disability strategy towards implementation within a logical framework analyses .
sign language interpretation services were offered and paid for at various events arranged by the desk , as well as the opening of parliament in 2000 .
mr speaker , at this stage we estimate that this will bring about a slight adjustment and that it will be done in-house .
during the second round we have had many training sessions , especially for the target schools in hiv / aids training as part of the life skills curriculum .
mr speaker , i now return to the other part of the question put by the hon member mr winde .
mr speaker , the provincial parliament and the cape metropolitan council made money available for the id campaign and the registration of voters .
the security of our people is something near to my heart , having been the minister responsible for the security portfolio for two years .
one could say that to some extent tourism is to the western cape today what gold was to johannesburg 100 years ago .
the promotion of the small and medium-sized business industry is the second key strategy for the promotion of economic growth and jobs in the province .
through this initiative we intend to link the western cape more closely and more profitably with the rest of the world .
we all know how important the environment is in the western cape and we are therefore all aware of the importance of an environmental commissioner .
one cannot manage diversity by simply replacing it with one 's notion of what should be in the mainstream .
sir , 88 % of our budget is spent on the three big departments , and that does not include the budget for housing .
in desperation they send their children to the western cape so that they can get a good education , even by means of falsifying matric certificates .
it is a pity that the president did not think to share this letter with the hon leader of the opposition at the time .
the registration of voters is not being done for a political party ; it is for everybody who needs to register .
what rules 104 to 107 do is to sanction by implication a process that has developed through convention , parliamentary practice and precedence .
mr speaker , on a point of order : may i ask to what point on the order paper this point of order is being directed ?
currently 60 megalitres of sewage flows to the zandvliet sewage treatment works per day , although it can only handle a capacity of 40 megalitres a day .
mr speaker , the inlet sieves at the macassar sewage treatment works have been replaced ; a subsidence tank has been upgraded ; and electrical improvements costing r3,5 million are being made at the moment .
the problem in that area is caused by the fact that there is not a consistent electricity supply from eskom there .
the cmc also deserves credit for the fact that certain members of the community have already received compensation for the losses that they suffered .
however , this provincial government has continuously monitored and will continue to monitor the council 's enforcement of the conditions of approval of the rezoning .
( 3 ) yes , except for two vacant flats at the provincial parliament building and union house which are required for provincial purposes .
the hon member mr strachan is sitting on the edge of his bench because he has asked that question , which is the next one .
it is the responsibility of this ministerial office to manage the implementation of the sea shore act and strict protocol is subsequently upheld with regard to any development under the high-water mark .
mr speaker , the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation was there to investigate , and did nothing .
i believe the time has come to give these wonderful awards , even posthumously , to the people who have served the province .
department of home affairs officials or not , it is that hon member 's government that is inept .
( 1 ) notes that 1 603 people were arrested in a recent special police operation , operation maximise , in the province ;
that budget can be used as a measure of the extent to which we have succeeded in meeting the key outcomes of this department .
i will liaise in this respect with the gambling board and the hon acting minister of social services , as well as other specialist individuals and organisations .
a number of documents containing guidelines and instructions , and an extensive training programme to facilitate the implementation of the act were also put together .
at the same time the department will ensure that a legal framework for accounting officers , executive authorities and other officials is in place , within which these functionaries can operate effectively .
as a result of the problems with the project we have taken the necessary remedial steps , including the processing of a revised contract .
the his project is constantly under the watchful eye of the provincial treasury committee which is due to receive a full report in this regard early in april .
madam chairperson , i feel humble to follow the speech that has just been made by the hon member mr ismail .
his thoughts and sentiments - they obviously have to be translated into policies and programmes - on the social costs of gambling are very heartening .
the main advantage of a free port is the reduction of customs formalities for ships entering the harbour , thereby speeding up the unloading procedure .
it is about the plan to raise r280 million in order to bring 8 000 extra policemen onto the streets in the western cape .
in fact , one can see some consistency with this statement by the hon minister of finance and development planning today .
i wish to deal with the role that the training of officials plays in the functional working of financial administration in the department of finance .
we on this side of the house are particularly glad that the training courses presented by the department of finance are accompanied by a quid pro quo .
at the time we were in sitting on the casino issue , we addressed the social ills that would come with the trade .
by standing arrangement the 1 598 functionally trained police officials utilised in the staff functions can be summoned for active functional duty in times of crisis .
now that we know how poorly the saps are going to be supported in the coming years , we have a clearer picture of where we stand .
it was a truly remarkable set of evenings , and the sheer brutality of rape and abuse that was levelled at that individual was brought home to all .
madam chairperson , i would like to inform the house that the last advertisement for 50 slots elicited 1 000 applications for the course .
no , they come from the headline and opening lines of a report in that good and faithful old newspaper , die burger , of 8 march 2000 .
after all , we know now who the " dead horse " is and who is the " horse " which is apparently alive and kicking .
is this to be understood as a sanction for her action on the part of the hon minister , or does it reflect his standpoint ?
i am quite sure that such information will enable them to make really effective corrections and bring about the most effective utilisation of resources possible .
the new np wishes to express its thanks to all the volunteers who have unselfishly volunteered their services to the neighbourhood watch institutions and to police forums .
our people are being turned back because they cannot communicate with the policemen on duty at the entrance to the legislature .
instead the hon minister opts for a research process that is going to incur cost and will reaffirm what we have been saying for a very long time .
in a speech at the march ms bokkie claasen said , and i quote from the paarl post of thursday , 27 january 2000 :
why does the hon premier not write the hon minister a note so that he can pay attention to what is happening ?
] they are satisfied with the hundreds of thousands of people who are brutalised , their property stolen and everything taken from them .
truancy is being addressed , however , in conjunction with the hon minister of education and various departments , specifically in the pilot area at the moment , which is manenberg .
however , i believe that meeting these priorities does not mean relegating sport and recreation to a minor priority .
sir , i think the time has come for us to attend coaching clinics and to assist the schools in our communities with the coaching of sport .
mr chairperson , i also want to thank the officials for a job well done with a small budget .
we can consider ourselves extremely lucky to have so many sporting heroes who are role models for the youth of our country and our province .
besides the natural beauty of the cape peninsula that can be effectively utilised in promoting sports tourism , we in the western cape have wonderful sports complexes .
that is why those hon members are rejecting these points ; they have been benefiting in the past and they are still enjoying the juice today .
finally , i want to thank the hon minister and his department for the work that they are doing in the area of sport-and-crime-prevention projects .
madam chairperson , i would firstly like to thank all the hon members for their contributions , even some of the more negative comments .
both the hon members messrs e isaacs and stali addressed school sports , and one or two other speakers referred to it as well .
if hon members cannot swim properly and want to learn how to swim i shall organise swimming instructors at the long street baths .
we are integrally involved in the bid , and when fifa comes here next week , we shall be meeting them and hosting them .
those people who do not yet have bar codes on their identity documents will be assisted to obtain them and to register as voters .
such persons will not need to pay the r5 application fee to the department of home affairs either ; the province will pay it on their behalf .
i want to thank the excellent carte blanche team at m-net for identifying the plight of residents in homes for the aged .
mr speaker , i am highly sympathetic to the plight of the aged and can assure hon members that this government will take action .
this project is aimed at selecting young south africans at risk and providing them with a constructive and intensive personal growth experience .
project chrysalis will divert the energies of the youth into constructive channels and create a better quality of life for all the people of our province .
tourism is the most important industry that will resolve the unemployment problem of this province and for that reason tourism must be cherished and must be accorded the attention it deserves .
sir , the tremendous influx of people to this province , which has resulted in virtually uncontrolled squatting , poses a severe threat to our natural assets .
words can be very hurtful , and they can also lead to incitement and actions not in the interest of this country .
can we call him a prophet of doom or a contemporary commentator , when so many key member states of the southern african development community carry the baggage of one-party rule ?
measured against objective standards such as their performance in international benchmarking studies and olympiads , some of our public schools are world class .
others have received significant inputs of resources from private and public sources , and have failed to improve their performance .
firstly , to establish good time management - or " time on task " - across our system and particularly in all our schools .
mr chairperson , we think it is a matter of considerable concern that matric is currently the only national benchmark in our education system .
we also require the schools on our programme to form partnerships with neighbouring schools so that they can jointly promote the safety plan .
they must comply with the law and the national and provincial policy frameworks , but within these parameters most of these schools are performing exceptionally well .
mr chairperson , there is a great deal that can still be said , and i will say so in reply to the questions of the hon members .
in this regard i want to thank dr booyse for the information he made available to me for this part of my speech .
mr chairperson , i want to talk about the nature of educational change in south africa in general and in the western cape in particular .
i want to read a comment by another eminent educationalist , michael gardiner , on the implementation of the national norms and standards in the western cape .
i therefore salute the enthusiastic and responsible dedication that the hon minister of education and her whole department are giving to this challenge .
in 1997 the results were the worst yet recorded , with only marginal improvements in 1998 and 1999 and pass rates at around 50 % .
as we move into the global knowledge society , we cannot afford to be left behind , trapped in a downward spiral of poverty and underdevelopment .
in conclusion , i once again would like to commend the hon minister and her department on this budget , and give it my full support .
let us ask fairmont college , which has the best sports facilities , whether the valhalla secondary school could not also make use of those sports facilities .
in our endeavour to achieve world-class education , disciplined and well-trained teachers play a key role in the establishment and maintenance of standards , sometimes under difficult circumstances .
what is disturbing about this setwork is that even though it was recommended , it contains the most filthy language and it blasphemes god 's name .
many of the schools last had a decent coat of paint 12 to 18 years ago and that was the last date when maintenance took place .
one of my major worries , as the hon member has expressed , is curriculum 2005 and the enormous complexities and problems associated with it .
i simply want to say to her that manenberg senior secondary school cannot be the yardstick for all institutions in disadvantaged areas .
i am pleased to be able to present today a budget for the 2000-01 financial year , which represents an additional r69 million in real terms .
- in general , we will be looking for ways to reorganise existing services and hospitals to enable them to perform better .
] it is a shame that the money remaining in the national government 's coffers was not transferred to the provinces .
madam chairperson , i would like to thank the hon minister of health for this budget , in which i know he played a major role .
the hon minister listened to his department 's concerns and acted , together with the hon minister of finance and development planning and the treasury .
in his speech last week , he went as far as to propose that hiv / aids be declared a national disaster .
madam chairperson , i would now like to address another subject , the patients ' rights charter included in the batho pele principles .
although there has been an increase in the hiv / aids budget , this is by far not enough to maintain the level of care that is required .
it is the primary health care component which is most interrelated with other sectors and where health has a vital advocacy role to play .
of course , what we need to do is raise our levels and then maintain those new standards as we go forward during the mtef period .
our policy of voluntary severance packages - and this is not a matter i want to touch on - has virtually crippled our health system .
we need to amend our laws and regulations to allow nurses and doctors who took vsps to return to state hospitals .
if he listens to his managers , he will hear that it may be too late - the private patients have bolted .
if one looks through this budget , as i have , one will see that there is r60 million short , despite the mtef .
i see that dr abel ragmanie omaya has come here in the hope that academic hospitals will be helped , but that is the message .
do we have the courage to take on that establishment and make sure that the rightsizing of the academic health centres moves apace ?
this research was very valuable to us in order for us to start focusing and refocusing our resources and their allocation .
the one facility will be operational in faure on 1 may 2000 for 60 boys between the ages of 14 and 17 .
unfortunately in clanwilliam a secure-care facility for 24 boys , also up to the age of 17 , will only be operational in 2001 .
of course , they receive the money from this branch and the staff of the relevant district office of social services provides assistance to the relevant municipalities .
the child support grant will only be for children up to the age of 7 , whereas the maintenance grant was up to the age of 18 .
that grant is only r100 and it is for the child , up to the age of 7 , and not for the parent .
the fact that there is already a special desk for poverty relief in place in the province is going to help a great deal to implement the action plans .
last but not least , from the provincial side we shall have to focus on job creation programmes aimed at households where there is no breadwinner .
the department currently subsidises two children 's homes focusing directly on hiv / aids babies and children at a unit cost of r820 per child per month .
however , with the implementation of the new welfare financing system , which focuses on a more holistic approach , this issue should be adequately addressed .
just to remind hon members , the women 's partnership against aids is part of a broad programme of advocacy , education , prevention and treatment .
in this very house the hon anc members commented that they would ask for the hon minister 's head for this unspent r10 million .
with increasing urbanisation and unemployment , we have lost over 1 million jobs in this country since 1994 resulting in increased poverty .
mr chairperson , poor people in our communities have for many years been subjected to uncaring bureaucracy and prejudice when they needed help .
i also hope the hon acting minister of social services will honour the funding commitment made towards the elukhuselweni home in khayelitsha .
if i recall correctly , the hon minister announced that he would be going to cabinet tomorrow with the issue of the commissioner for children .
we have just had a review during this phase of the 1999-2000 financial year and , for the information of the house , nothing has been delivered !
furthermore attention will be given to an investigation into the effective utilisation of funds that have already been specifically allocated to the sphere of disability .
madam chairperson , in conclusion our plea to the house is to let us together help our poor people to realise their dreams .
in my opinion other channels must be investigated to determine whether other methods can be used to address that gap .
madam chairperson , i also take cognisance of the fact that the hon member mr louis is very concerned about fiscal and financial responsibilities .
this will enable the wesbank community to reach important amenities in delft until such time as these facilities have been established in wesbank .
i hear the hon member mr isaacs say , " mm " , because this is something that is close to his heart .
we are also about to embark upon road shows where the latest housing developments and key issues will be discussed with all local authorities .
since the permanent staff establishment did not make provision for such a post , the post of business manager was advertised for appointment on the basis of a six-month contract .
in some cases beneficiaries do not even take up occupation of the houses , but sell them out of hand for a few hundred rand .
" there is another saying that goes : " show me the minister 's officials and i can tell you who the minister is .
i will never plead again for those people who are waiting anxiously for the day to dawn when they can also have ownership of their flats .
that was identified in this particular report and absolutely nothing has been done , while the poorest of the poor continue to live without adequate housing .
the first is in respect of land and the availability of that land , and the second deals directly with the method of subsidy allocation .
mr chairperson , i commend and support the hon minister of housing and his department on their budget vote and thank them for their hard work and dedication .
madam chairperson , our starting point is that the struggle of the people of the western cape is a struggle for a better life for all .
( 2 ) the state must take reasonable legislative and other measures , within its available resources , to achieve the progressive realisation of this right .
each has just one outside toilet and one shower cubicle - yes , one outside toilet for two dwellings and one shower cubicle for two dwellings .
madam chairperson , i am thankful for the work that the member of the new np in the paarl local transitional council ...
madam chairperson , in may 1998 it was reported that , in the cape peninsula alone , there were 72 315 informal structures in which people lived .
because the housing departments of the western cape , gauteng - at the time dan mofokeng was still their mec for housing - and kwazulu-natal insisted on it .
now that hon member comes here and tells us sanctimoniously that they will talk to " sankie " and ask her to postpone the matter .
] they are also told , " if you already have a house and you do not vote for us , then we will throw you out .
it was not done especially for this debate , so if that hon member wants the facts , he must come and ask me .
i do not think we should make politics of this , as certain hon members are in fact trying to do , because this is an incentive for our municipalities .
we do not just do audits , give instructions and make recommendations to local authorities , but also have a management support programme .
of this grant , an amount of r3,6 million was allocated to municipalities which were negatively affected by the new equitable-share allocation .
we are also experiencing a lack of integrated effort in the metropolitan area among the seven municipalities , that is to say the six local councils and the cape metropolitan council .
i have also approached the saimas association to see where they can be of assistance to us with certain work study matters regarding the ethics of service delivery .
however , very importantly , we must keep a balance between the appointment of members of staff and the service delivery that we will have in that specific municipality .
annually the national minister of finance will determine a cap on the growth in expenditure and we want local authorities to stay within that .
therefore , as soon as the new council is constituted , it will be their responsibility to appoint a new chief executive officer as they see fit .
before i see the next speaker , i wish to point out to hon members that when i nod my head , it is not in agreement .
he referred to the masakhane programme and said that we should be honest , masakhane was flagging and we knew that that came from the national government .
mr chairperson , the hon minister has done nothing to turn around the culture of non-payment , and that is why local governments are going bankrupt today .
i would like to thank the hon minister of local government for his very comprehensive address and the very wide range of issues that he tackled .
for the first time in south africa 's history , all local governments right around the country will be governed and ordered in terms of a common legislative framework .
we are faced with rigid old-fashioned labour structures , and there is a distinct danger that we can simply transfer these into the new unicity .
the one discordant note has come from the hon member mr silke , who was beating the same old drum again .
the fact remains , however , that the political party which governs is not the common denominator in respect of those councils that do experience problems .
the consolidated municipal infrastructure programme ( cmip ) emerged from the rationalisation of three short-term programmes that funded municipal bulk infrastructure between 1995-96 and 1997-98 .
either we see ourselves as an administrative extension of national government , or we say that we are a government in our own right .
poverty funds , housing funds and cmip funds have avoided the scrutiny of this house and that is why we cannot govern effectively .
secondly , the acdp feels that the political parties must be challenged to look at the criteria and procedure in electing candidates .
i do not want to go back into history and say where non-payment began , how it occurred and what caused it .
the municipality of oostenberg had the courage to decide to make available the land that they had and make a contribution .
if the anc wants to make a contribution to improving the quality of the community and to alleviating poverty , i say yes .
i think we must cooperate according to those broad principles and not try to put a gulf between parties where we do , in fact , have certain points of contact .
the subdirectorate has also obtained school , clinic and hospital attendance figures , especially with regard to people from outside the western cape province using these services .
the report on existing migration information and proposals on further information needs and the monitoring of trends should be available during the next few months .
most importantly , the department is entrusted with the implementation and execution of policies with regard to land reform and the processing of appeals .
the western cape cannot effectively manage these rural areas , nor transform them whilst the powers are vested in the national minister .
if hon members look at programme 3 : development planning in the gold book , they will see that the budget allocation to this department is r29,594 million .
i also congratulate all the officials of the department - john africa , errol myburgh , rudi ellis , chris rabie , leon fouch and dawie kruger .
accordingly we in these benches make an urgent appeal to the hon minister to appoint the members of the planning review board as soon as possible .
unfortunately i have to do my job , so hon members must forgive me if i take longer than i intend to .
i want to say to the hon member mr ismail that land reform will be addressed by the integrated development framework processes at the third sphere of government .
the hon member mr ozinsky said here today that there is a minister from the former cabinet who has an interest in valkenberg .
let me read a motion to hon members that served before the urban and environmental services committee of the spm on 16 september 1998 .
i now come to my good friend - and i do not say so for descriptive purposes - the hon member ms essop .
i hope that they have finally got the message and that i will be able to present the hon premier with a review board that i can recommend .
regarding the development facilitation act that he mentioned , principles of the dfa are included in the new planning and development act .
i wanted the act to come into effect on 1 may , because 1 may is a very special day on our calendar .
the success of the western cape nature conservation board is crucial to the unlocking of ecotourism in the western cape and hence the economy of this province .
the key aspects of this delivery are the establishing and functioning of the western cape cultural commission , the functioning of the language committee , library services , museum services , cultural services and youth camps .
moreover , through cultural affairs we look at and assist youth , popular culture and the cultural expressions of people in their communities .
the roll-out of subsidies to build new libraries and upgrade existing ones - all in previously disadvantaged communities - continues unabated .
this is over and above the allocation for new libraries in zwelihle , genadendal and nqubela , and an upgrade at mcgregor in the current budget year .
this is precisely what we need to do to combat the aids virus , and so our initiatives in both these endeavours are complementary .
these are but two examples of how anti-aids activities will be woven into the very fabric of the work that my department will do .
three language practitioners , who will assist the language committee in its task , will be paid from funds allocated for personnel expenditure in the subprogramme , cultural services .
i am particularly grateful for the new library to be established in nqubela at robertson and for the upgrading of the mcgregor library .
secondly , it may be a spontaneous action on the part of individuals or groups of people to organise themselves on either a general or specific issue .
we will come back to this issue later in this session , because there are a number of other cases the hon premier should know about .
] in this case it is worse , because we are dealing with a key issue related to the economy and the future development of the province .
mr chairperson , i want to join my colleagues in congratulating the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs and his department on this budget .
we as the acdp believe that the hon minister has a definite responsibility in the allocation of funds to ensure sound moral standards .
that people publish environmental impact assessments and there is nobody monitoring or checking them is a real fact and a critical issue .
madam chairperson , the culture of learning and teaching must touch the very soul of each teacher , pupil and parent , as well as the community .
if the government is committed to social upliftment , the higher quality of life will guide the relevant communities and equip them to manage the environment in a sustainable way .
let me say at once that i am fully aware that greater spirits than i have had serious disagreements about this issue .
yes , i believe that the hon minister has been advised as follows by his officials : " leave it at that , minister ; do not touch this matter .
apparently there has been some biosphere training and there is a workshop organised for may this year specifically dealing with that topic .
( 4 ) puts a monitoring mechanism in place which will ensure that the provincial cabinet be held accountable to the motion and applicable time frame .
the exception does not apply to all owners but only those who are buying a house for the first time under the discount scheme of r7 500 .
it was the culture of the anc to tell people not to pay , and to say that the debt should be written off .
i am very sorry to inform the house that mr mike spence , chief-director : transport , will retire at the end of april 2000 .
we are also pleased that r2 million has been provided for the reconstruction of chapmans peak drive and we hope that work will take place very quickly .
i do not know whether the argus cycle tour will be using chapmans peak as part of their route this year because it is still a risky business .
the matter of poverty eradication requires a massive public works programme driven by the department of transport and public works .
i raised this matter with the hon minister on two occasions and he promised that he would address the issue .
every year we get a few million rands too little . earlier on the hon minister referred to budget which amounts to approximately r428 million .
as the hon minister said , it is only the good weather in the western cape that prevents our roads from being totally destroyed .
over the past year legislation has been passed by parliament , inter alia the legislation on toll-roads that we approved in november last year .
he has to telephone to pretoria and hope that he gets an answer there , because a place has not yet been established that he can telephone to .
i am sure that as long as the hon minister is the minister , we shall apply discipline and see to it that this does not happen in this province .
while we are talking about generating our own funds , the department of transport is one of the few departments that generates funds for the province .
madam chairperson , too much emphasis is placed on consulting engineers who deal with tender documents , resulting in over-dependence on the side of the department .
] i do not believe i shall be spared to talk about it for 21 years like the hon member mr king .
i want to say that it could cost them ever coming back to this house if one began using it as an election tool .
the hon member mr mckenzie will agree with me - he also conveyed thanks and appreciation to them because they did good work .
we salute the management teams that have done tremendous work to make it possible for us to keep the economy going .
they have been on the table for four to five years already and i believe that the district councils and the province must now sign these agreements .
that happened in the case of ms zulfa allie , the woman contractor who was badly treated at the hands of the hon minister 's departmental officials .
it is the people who talk to each other when the minister is replying who are making a lot of noise , and not the hecklers .
( 3 ) ( a ) 20 of the companies on the list have defaulted .
madam chairperson , since i cannot put the question directly to you , i shall put it to the hon member ms essop .
i went to work and she went with me on a saturday afternoon , while a lot of other mpps were at newlands , watching rugby .
the national minister of transport issued a proclamation that buses may not travel at a speed higher than 100 km / h .
i should like the hon member ms essop to give me a copy of the tender documents so that we can look at them .
however it was all in the spirit of a correct answer , so that we do not send members out here without having been able to answer them .
madam chairperson , as i was saying , the result of this hassle factor is that businesses simply no longer employ people .
however , this economy has much more profound impacts and effects at society level , at company level and for the single employee than simply the use of it .
madam chairperson , what is happening through the internet is that the value added through trademarks for retail businesses is disappearing .
one can go to a website linked to at least 12 different bookstores , and one can pick the same book simply from the cheapest provider .
they are about to open their own factory and they will add another 60 employees to the employment force of 300 already .
madam chairperson , it was interesting to note that at the davos summit this year there were several forums on the internet and it industry .
the view of sectors that are going to grow and those which will decline , must after all form the basis of the industrial development policy of the province .
the reason for this is that globalisation has meant that both domestic and foreign investors operate in the same market and are subjected to the same market forces .
it would therefore be necessary to strengthen both the focus and the capacity of the provincial and local spheres of government to deal with these matters .
we in this province have not adopted similar legislation to date , mainly due to concerns regarding the constitutionality of the legislation .
under his guidance several new projects have seen the light such as the publication distributed to hon members , getting started in tourism .
and for the sake of those hon members who are not aware of this , indaba 2000 is the pace-setting annual show for tourism products in south africa .
this website will provide tourists , and intending tourists , with real time information on accommodation , attractions , industry news , restaurants , conference facilities and so on within the western cape .
the major shift of policy is to outsource advice centres to community and other organisations already involved in this type of work .
the information on this register is currently being audited by eight firms of consultants who were appointed through a tender process on a regional basis .
the concession is for planting vineyards on 130 hectares of prime land , and to erect a wine cellar on the farm .
] hon members of this house will know that the way business always thinks is from the perspective of : " how many investments have come in ?
i would like to deal with a couple of issues regarding the province as it is , and the first critical issue , which we have been speaking about for a long time , is taxation .
the problem that i have in principle is that we have kept our contribution to them for the past three years at r3,5 million .
on the same date , on 7 march , i asked the department how many negotiations we were engaged in regarding public / private partnerships .
in three years , if we are only busy negotiating two public / private partnerships , i think we need to start emphasising this priority .
i would just like to say to the whole department and to the hon minister that they must understand our enormous support and passion for this department .
the recent increase in the diesel and petrol prices , and the associated levy of five cents , will also affect the economic activity in our province .
technical development programmes - presented by the techno-parks and institutes - aimed at stimulating the manufacturing sector in the western cape , are praiseworthy .
coordination with the private sector in the western cape that is trading with africa , will also contribute towards favourable relations with other provinces in africa .
peter coyle says , unlike tony leon , that the vision must be acceptable to a broad range of interests and , above all , it must give hope .
peter coyle talks about the lack of coordination in this province , including the lack of national government involvement in the institutional framework of this province .
this policy , along with legislation to licence and regulate manufacturers and sellers of liquor , will start to address certain imbalances in this industry .
they must understand that a complaint from the neighbours , or a contravention of the laid down laws , will result in forced closure of their tavern .
in order to achieve the objectives of sustainability and driving the economy and social reconstruction and development , key policy objectives in strategies must be pursued .
we are still seeing today the result of the attitude of the hon minister in the exclusion of businessmen and tourism operators from the previously disadvantaged communities .
madam chairperson , allow me to highlight the differences between the average length of stay of domestic visitors and international visitors to cape town .
the notion of e-commerce that has been accepted uncritically , i suppose , by this hon minister needs to be examined in detail very seriously .
in fact , the giving of content to his vision and his strategic objective for a knowledge economy must be underpinned by the notion of people-driven technology .
i want to raise concerns - these have already been voiced by the hon member mr strachan - about the issue of the financing of wesgro .
i also want to warn the hon minister that if the pdc is done away with in this province , we will be committing a fundamental error .
we would like to thank the hon minister for his work and , in particular , the department and all those statutory bodies that support this ministry .
they have done really good work - except , of course , that i am still waiting to hear from the tourism board on what their performance measurements are .
for many people it is seen as a discouragement to foreign investment , and i think we have to be very wary of that in this country .
we would hope that particularly in the inner city the international convention centre project could become catalyst for the resolution of some of those very difficult problems .
hon members will note that one of the nine objectives of the province and all the departments is to reinforce our links with africa .
in current world markets there is an additional source of change in volume in the already unstable local situation and that is the change in volume in other parts of the world .
if the land reform process in south africa is too slow , then agriculturists cannot be accused , but the national government will have to bear the blame .
on 3 march this year another poultry farm which slaughtered 42 000 chickens daily and employed 1 150 people , was liquidated .
exploitation and the taking of land by colonial and apartheid governments has meant that the majority of the rural inhabitants are unemployed or underpaid .
agriculture has its own special and unique work relations but all the labour laws have not contributed towards improving the position of the farm workers .
if the anc government , which is the owner of these laws , had really wanted to help them , then a friendly working environment should have been created for the workers .
minimum wages in the western cape will not be a threat to western cape agriculture because in the western cape we pay our people in ...
there is no problem with heckling , but i think the acoustics are very bad and we cannot hear the speaker .
the anc started last year already and we shall now constantly be hearing about people who are exploited and human rights that are being denied .
that is a joke , particularly if one bears in mind that the western cape is responsible for 60 % of all the agricultural exports of south africa .
the prices of mutton and beef are now the same as they were five years ago but the price of feed has recently increased by 20 % .
arising out of that the co-operative cellars had a surplus of chardonnay on their hands , instead of selling the wine at a lower price .
if we are not going to protect the local market , we can accept the fact that another 57 000 people will be without work .
if he is under the influence , he does not hesitate to chase bokkie and the children around and assault them .
i invite the national government , too , to reach out to agriculture , as the hon member mr louis has also asked .
it is not i who dismissed joe seremane because he finalised only 40 claims over a period of five years .
it is true that a month or two before an election we hear about minimum wages , and after that we do not hear a word about it .
the hon member mr n m isaacs is right , it is true that agriculture is the industry that creates most employment .
] if i may continue , that means that vote 1 - the premier 's vote - is accepted but the objection is noted .
( 1 ) expresses its concern that the president considers hiv / aids not necessarily to be caused by a virus ;
those people who do not yet have bar codes on their identity documents will be assisted to obtain them and to register as voters .
such persons will not need to pay the r5 application fee to the department of home affairs either ; the province will pay it on their behalf .
i want to thank the excellent carte blanche team at m-net for identifying the plight of residents in homes for the aged .
mr speaker , i am highly sympathetic to the plight of the aged and can assure hon members that this government will take action .
this project is aimed at selecting young south africans at risk and providing them with a constructive and intensive personal growth experience .
project chrysalis will divert the energies of the youth into constructive channels and create a better quality of life for all the people of our province .
tourism is the most important industry that will resolve the unemployment problem of this province and for that reason tourism must be cherished and must be accorded the attention it deserves .
words can be very hurtful , and they can also lead to incitement and actions not in the interest of this country .
can we call him a prophet of doom or a contemporary commentator , when so many key member states of the southern african development community carry the baggage of one-party rule ?
it is thus considered that emergency legislation is urgently required to prevent the taxi industry from carrying out this type of action in the future .
i wish to extend a special word of thanks to mr robbie vincent , who spent his whole easter weekend drafting the legislation .
the sooner this happens , the sooner this will greatly facilitate the management of the taxi industry in the provinces and not only in the western cape .
however , the udm also needs to caution that the hon minister of transport and works should act responsibly and very sensitively , with the possible ...
he is the reason why the hon leader of the opposition and the hon member mr ramatlakane are no longer in the cabinet .
he was so stringent that he said that it should be within a radius of 5 km from the centre of that area .
i also wish to thank the hon member mr lewis for his support and for his correction in regard to not simply closing the taxi ranks .
the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation cannot take action against gangs on the cape flats - history catches up with him .
we shall try to ensure that the guilty are held accountable , and that where appropriate , bail is not granted ; and that minimum penalties are properly upheld .
they have made jails something criminals look forward to , because they can escape from their own poverty by going to stay in their five-star jails .
] i am so glad that those hon members are awake , because i would hate them to sleep while i am talking .
if one goes to speak to the mothers and to the children as well very often they form part of that network .
already , in the structure of how the gang links up with the family , it is problematical to obtain witnesses from the community .
secondly , we have to tell one another bluntly that the witness protection programme in our province and in south africa simply lacks credibility at the moment .
unemployment and addressing unemployment are things that all of us will have to attend to in our endeavour and search for solutions .
mr speaker , if we fail to establish a culture of human rights , a new transformed south africa will remain a dream and an ideal .
i should like to cite the necklace murders and all those related things and challenge the hon member mr byneveldt with them .
he says that one of the ways to win the emotions of the people is to make use of tragedies and particularly funerals .
this is quite a large army and they are well-armed and they have a culture established over a period of 150 years .
mr speaker , i have a document here which contains many of the names of those involved and the areas where they are active .
do hon members know that the constables we have deployed over the past year have reduced crime in those areas by 29 % on average ?
unfortunately , at the moment the indications are that we have still not learnt our lesson with regard to " liberation before education " .
report of the standing committee on economic development , on the western cape road transportation act amendment bill [ b7-2000 ] , dated 11 may 2000 , as follows :
sir , this letter , relating to " voter registration for the 1999 election " , is dated 17.11.1998 - 10 days before we had to begin with registrations .
] for the information of the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism , the dp is renowned as being the watchdog for taxpayers ' money .
at that level mr ken andrew would be the first person to stand up and actually shout : " abuse of power !
thirdly , the hon premier stated in the house yesterday that they were going to spend r5,5 million on a registration process in the next round .
in conclusion , i wish to make a commitment here today to respond to the request of the hon premier for us to be constructive .
mr speaker , the " call " which the hon member mr ismail referred to is a call to all the provinces for volunteers .
we need to ask what tony leon means when he says he does not want to blow life into this lifeless thing , the new np ?
] how many new np organisers have been absorbed into the cabinet and the provincial government and how many new np organisers are now employed in the administration ?
sir , yesterday afternoon the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling received a good overview from the director-general relating to this expenditure that was incurred .
] later on in my speech i will quote the number of people we actually registered through the process that we entered into .
madam chairperson , through you to the hon minister of finance and development planning , before i get to my question i wish to mention the following .
the hon member mr ozinsky can put his question in another form , because we are now dealing with the hon minister of health .
however , when the hon minister of health refers the question to somebody else , it does not necessarily mean that we have to follow it up now .
the hon minister of finance and development planning has passed his vote , but this bill belongs to him and that is the fundamental difference .
was there a standard criterion or measurement given to all departments and ministers as to how much they can actually release from their fund ?
if we do not keep democracy alive in the country , we will drown in the soup and still be on the road to damnation .
madam chairperson , i want to ask the hon minister of social services and poverty relief whether he could inform us on exactly what date ...
madam chairperson , this hon member knows that this question is not relevant to what we are discussing here .
madam chairperson , i want to ask the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs whether he has already received the detailed information from his department ?
madam chairperson , the decision was not informed by the details of the expenditure , but i approved the expenditure in terms of this vote .
in her telephone conversation with mr fourie , did she specifically ask whether teachers were taken out of their classrooms and employed for this purpose ?
could we have a ruling that all hon ministers whose votes are addressed here will remain here in order to answer their questions ?
i could understand that for the 1998-99 financial year , but we are dealing with the current financial year , which we have not even concluded yet .
the point is that each person has three questions to ask , and they have the opportunity here to ask those questions per vote .
r9 000 is r9 000 too much when one takes into account where we are in terms of crime in particular in this province .
obviously , if we could have saved that money it could have been utilised in the brown issues the hon member ms essop referred to .
the hon minister now has the knowledge that this was a call for volunteers and that they did not have to be paid .
given the above information , would the hon minister have agreed to shift r1,6 million out of the education budget to the revenue fund ?
we hope we are wrong when we get the impression that the hon premier has not grasped the centrality of this programme .
urban renewal for guguletu , manenberg , bonteheuwel , nyanga and all other townships must be the locus of cooperative governance between the province and the unicity .
we cannot allow that the entire debate about hiv / aids is reduced to a debate about which drug works best .
it has strengthened my resolve to tackle this challenge head-on and work closely with both the national and the local governments .
on the one hand the approach will be to do what the hon leader of the opposition called " urban renewal " .
in many of the communities where poverty and associated social problems already existed and were rampant , this can aggravate the problems .
mr speaker , in the 20 months since the 1999 elections we have been focusing on building a non-racial , non-sexist , democratic and united province .
i must also say that the hon premier has now been premier for more than a year and the plan is still coming .
i also have to say that the provincial commissioner of police has now been appointed for approximately a year , and the plan is still coming .
today i propose on behalf of the anc that the provincial commissioner of police must be given three months to turn the tide .
despite many heroic , praiseworthy and self-sacrificing efforts on the part of our police force it seems that there is no checking this meaningless violence .
in principle the udm supports him in focusing on these matters in his planning for the coming year .
nothing has been said about the level of matric exemptions in the former house of representatives and department of education and training schools .
i was extremely disappointed that the hon premier did not see fit to include housing as one of his priorities .
let us take the case of mr koopman of watsonia 1193 ; he owed the council just over r1 000 in basic services .
] it is this same spin doctor that says on behalf of his leader in the newspapers that history is on the anc 's side .
if one were to speak about the rule of justice and due process , key concepts in democracy , it would be greek to the anc representative in crossroads .
in future it would be advisable for us to locate ourselves as a province which is part of the people of south africa .
it has been the struggle of the anc-led government to get pharmaceutical companies to make prescription drugs accessible to the poor .
fishing vessels seem to be able to make better catches by trading illegally in contraband than by putting a line in the water .
i believe that the average hiv infection rate in the province can easily be doubled if one looks at the numbers in this region alone .
i know that the hon minister of education said that they should make an arrangement , but the fact is that our people feel alienated .
instead , as the hon premier will do in his reply on friday , he will say that it is the national government 's fault .
often to a great extent there is only seasonal work in the rural areas , and it is limited to a few weeks of the year .
let me explain to those hon members who cannot understand how a person can earn r7 a week , what happened there .
the hon minister of health merely paid lip service to the issue by involving a handful of organisations and individuals in this process .
no anc councillor has the power to call on the rdp to have an agm to satisfy mr noludwe .
the people who should benefit from the development are from boystown , but they are not the ones that are stopping the development .
i wish to thank all my colleagues for the warm welcome they extended to me as soon as i walked onto the 5th floor .
in spite of the fact that for a brief period i was not a parliamentary representative , i was nevertheless still very active politically .
if they deceive themselves , as they did at their lekgotla in citrusdal recently , they will keep on getting hidings at the polls .
] i call upon them to tell the people they are sorry , because it seems as if this mouse brought forth an elephant .
let us not be so obsessed with party politics that we forget that it is agriculture that produces the food on our tables .
mr speaker , to begin with i too want to add my voice to the chorus of congratulations to the hon premier on his 60th birthday .
they were sold in the best tradition of slavery and they earned anything between r7 and r48 for a week 's hard labour .
how many births of hiv-positive babies could not have been prevented if all hiv-positive mothers had access to drugs like azt or nevirapine ?
statistics showed that 35,5 % of the pregnant women who died underwent hiv-testing , but 68 % of them tested positive .
these lists are actually lists for drugs for which the patent has expired , meaning that these are genetic drugs - hence cheap drugs .
the clinical data that will be derived from the project will certainly contribute towards determining the effect of this as well as the safety of nevirapine .
the epicentre has sucked in our nation and caused us to go into denial in respect of the need to change our lifestyles .
there is real delivery in terms of reducing backlogs at most of our disadvantaged schools to the tune of some r40 million .
mr speaker , i also want to come to the issue of cameras being used to fight crime - the so-called closed-circuit tv cameras .
when the total amount of r135 million was allocated , it was on the clear understanding that business plans had to be prepared for every one of them .
firstly , as a matter of interest , in january alone the province received approximately r8 million - in round figures - in taxation from the grandwest casino .
madam chairperson , i have answered this question before in the standing committee and i will do so again for the benefit of the house .
that the house congratulates the mayor of cape town on her unopposed appointment as chairperson of the south african local government association ( salga ) .
( 3 ) the general high level of baasskap , racism and exploitation which prevail on farms in the province .
is it not perhaps we who on the one hand are quietly inciting the situation and on the other hand holding out a hand ?
as you know , at the outset i asked whether there were any of us here who do this , and my speech is still dealing with that question .
we should ask for the hon minister of transport and works to immediately implement the amendment to the transport act that we have agreed to .
mr speaker , on friday i was there for the third time to witness the situation after a week of pouring rain .
we need to look not only at the local road transportation board and the licensing system , but also at the practice of selling licences on .
] she will again stand up here and say , " those blacks , those schools , have not performed , " and she will close the schools .
other sectors are also affected , such as business - in fact , everybody is affected ; life is in a state of havoc .
i phoned my colleague and i asked him to ask his law enforcement people to do what we had already agreed to do in our taxi violence task team .
mr speaker , on a point of order : the hon minister said , " and their government must have the blood on their hands .
we have seen how " gabs " - golden arrow bus services - workers work under threat of death or injury .
mr speaker , we have heard inflammatory statements made by people posing as taxi leaders threatening the whole province with violence .
we have seen transport routes being blocked by either taxis or buses as they try to express their points of view .
despite the instability in the transport sector , the people in the taxi industry seem to be the people who are benefiting out of this crisis .
i want a solution that will bring peace for those half million people , the people of golden arrow and those in the taxi industry .
mr speaker , on a point of order : is it parliamentary for the hon minister to tell an hon member , " hou jou bek !
on friday i sent a message to the meeting when they asked me whether i was prepared to assist the local road transportation board .
i have just ruled that i will take notices of motion just before the notice of motion printed on the order paper .
the applicable rule states that preference should be given to interpellations and questions on tuesdays , and it is printed as such on the order paper .
( 1 ) pays tribute to one of the finest legal minds our country has known , and mourns the passing of chief justice ismail mahomed ;
it gives one an idea of the enormity of events like this in terms of benefit to cities and their economies .
i want to thank the hon member mr n m isaacs in advance , because he will take the bill further on behalf of the hon member mr louis .
furthermore , the bill before us seeks to authorise a unique vehicle to establish the convention centre , namely a private company with limited liability .
it is a frightening thought that we in this house are being asked to make this deceptive submission to the co-shareholders in this company .
mr speaker , with the establishing of a convention centre of international repute in the mother city of south africa another historic milestone will be reached .
by supporting this bill the new np , and we as its members of the provincial parliament , endorse it from our side of the house .
we in the western cape remain a long-haul destination for most of the rest of the world , excluding sub-saharan africa .
regions such as new south wales and western australia or british colombian canada form the competitive environment making the second phase much more challenging and competitive .
it must start to compare itself to its peers , not only inside africa , but outside africa , such as melbourne , barcelona , sydney and edinburgh .
here we are really setting the scene for unprecedented economic growth which can only have a positive effect on all the peoples of this province .
this serious intention on the part of the provincial government to marry government and private sector is very strongly supported by us on this side of the house .
this is not a simple transfer of moneys to an ngo ; it is the purchasing of shares in a shareholding company .
i am bringing the race issue in here again , because that is what i intend to do - three of them are black .
she was looking for a great omission in the legal drafting , and she rummaged about and stumbled upon the definition of the province .
he said that the anc would be moving it in the house , and that is why the department did not move the amendment .
this is because , firstly , the legal personality of the existing parties will change in november when the city of cape town and the cmc become one .
as far as we are concerned , this is the official bill here today , unless the hon minister can give the house greater clarity on this matter .
madam chairperson , we have a rephrased clause here without an official amendment for the rephrasing , and it does change the meaning of it .
( ii ) general report of the auditor-general on the accounts of the provincial administration : western cape for 1996-97 [ pr 31 / 1999 ] ;
( iii ) general report of the auditor-general on the accounts of the provincial administration : western cape for 1997-98 [ pr 4 / 2000 ] ;

vote 6 - health ( auditor-general 's report [ pr2 / 2000 - page 9 , paragraph 3.7 ] ) : alleged fraud : part-time district surgeons
mr speaker , the first thing we should not confuse today , is the categories and the types of municipality that we shall be discussing .
i shall have the choice of selecting one per category for a specific municipality and applying it in those municipalities .
in general the chairperson of a standing committee speaks after the minister , but that is not an absolute rule .
] he leads his party by saying that they are not sure whether they are going to get the majority in certain local authorities .
the types of municipalities are indicated and described in accordance with the kind of political decision-making structure that the municipality will have , for example a municipality with an executive mayor .
just because this work of upliftment is of outstanding importance for a prosperous south africa , quality management is essential for the creation and maintenance of a prosperous community .
the western cape determination of types of municipalities bill is crucial in determining the political and practical functioning of this increasingly important sphere of government .
indeed , proof of this is the restructuring of local government via the local government : municipal structures act , which not only serves ...
i want to know if it is fair to base an entire piece of legislation on the assumption that the anc will win the election ?
" be it the new np , the dp or the anc who wins it , this concerns a principle of an executive mayor .
the anc in the western cape province say that they do not want dan kotz there , while the local inhabitants elect dan kotz .
the reality is that those who benefited in the apartheid era are saying in the house today that we should not judge the past .
as far as i know , the total number of judges in their different categories is as follows : 130 white males ; 11 white females ; 42 black males ; and 9 black females .
similarly , we have a situation where the head of public prosecutions was the former head of the anc in the old senate .
if one is going to rely on reporting in die burger , or weekend newspapers in particular , one will obviously draw a certain conclusion .
however , the anc has had enough time - more than six years - to transform the judiciary to suit themselves .
the dp , to whom my coloured brothers want to sell our people out , have never been of any benefit to the coloured people of this province .
mr speaker , we have seen a display of demagoguery and populist group mobilisation in the best tradition of apartheid .
mr speaker , the anc is desperate for total power and they will use group and race mobilisation until they get it , just like mugabe .
today we have gone through an apparent drama where the new np lost 39 councillors to the dp , who have also got mr kriel .
" the new np backed down and they gathered together 18 whites and 4 coloureds to discuss their future working relationship .
keeping this in mind , we accused the house earlier on that when they speak of " oos-kapenaars " they are actually speaking about " kaffers " .
those hon members who were the former opposition lived in this country , but their opposition was not the size of a pea .
a dialogue has arisen between the anc and the dp here , and we have not really reached the point of the motion .
the new np is opposed to any cheque-book politics , whether it comes from the anc , the dp or the udm .
they cannot use their properties as collateral and therefore they will never have access to a business loan in these financial institutions .
integration in the world economy and drastic technological development mean that the small , medium and micro businesses are becoming increasingly important to the south african economy .
in order to ensure that more small businesses are established the new np believes that red tape should be eliminated as far as possible .
one business contractor cited a case where he offered a house in guguletu as collateral security for obtaining bridging finance on a building contract .
] for example , what may be appropriate for the textile industry in the eastern cape is not necessarily appropriate for the more industrialised and commerce-rich western cape .
mr speaker , we also referred to ceilings placed on mortgage loans that relate to the group area rather than to the level of income .
the example is the bank employee who wants to obtain a loan herself , from her own bank where she works , and cannot do so .
the role that the anc has played is in saying that we should perhaps establish whether a prima facie case exists in the western cape .
one of the biggest problems is , in fact , credit blacklisting , where people have had a judgment against them some time in the past .
so we can raise a number of these problems , exacerbated by a culture of non-payment which was deliberately promoted by that party , ...
] if we keep the bottom line in mind , that there must be a reasonable chance of commercial success , we can take it further .
vote 12 - education ( auditor-general 's report [ pr 66 / 2000 - page 3 , paragraph 3.1 ] ) : transportation of learners
vote 17 - transport ( auditor-general 's report [ pr 37 / 2000 - page 3 , paragraph 3.2 ] ) : suspense and disallowance accounts
mr speaker , since three interpellations have been printed on the question paper , i ask that the motion in my name printed on the order paper -
( 4 ) as a result the oversight and accountability function of the provincial parliament and its standing committees have therefore been seriously neglected and undermined ;
today , when the same people say we should bring in an equitable rating system , it is again the dp that is fighting against the system .
] that will , of course lower rates , but my colleagues on that side of the house refuse to acknowledge privatisation as a particular option .
we say there must be a house connection for water ; there must be full waterborne sanitation ; and there must be weekly kerb-side collections .
the saps does not have a criminologically based crime reporting system available and the reporting of such incidents relies heavily upon the discretion of individual police stations .
i think that many of our debates will deal with this matter and we certainly cannot sweep this matter under the carpet .
however , successes are indeed being achieved with the arrest of suspects and this , together with the successful prosecution of the accused , will in due course have an effect .
recently mr willem odendaal was sentenced to one year of imprisonment and a fine of r1 500 after he had assaulted one of his farm workers .
the president placed the safety of our farms high on the agenda by way of media statements and other reports on 17 february 2000 .
such a motion would require prior notice to the presiding officer , whether it is i , the speaker or any of the temporary chairpersons .
i do not think that members would do so , because we all treat the moment of silence with the respect it deserves .
this affects not only families , but farm workers and their families who find a home in agriculture and depend on it for a livelihood .
that more time be made available for the distribution of the documents , discussion thereof in the various caucuses and in the ad hoc committees .
that the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling be provided on a regular basis with updated statistics and information on the western cape economy .
mr speaker , i am concerned that that rather flippant response did not constitute an apology and i would like to address you on this .
( 3 ) congratulates director kahn on his decision to appeal against this judgment , and further expresses the hope that justice will prevail .
mr speaker , the eighth amendment bill is a money bill and was considered separately from the other amendments which were proposed by the standing committee .
sir , the purpose of the proposed substitution of schedule iv of the law is , and i quote from point 5.1 of the explanatory memorandum :
mr speaker , before i go into some detail regarding the proposed amendments , i would like to make some more general remarks pertaining to gambling .
we are looking forward to the opening of these casinos and wish the board and the operators every good fortune in their endeavours .
in fact , these minors will not be allowed to walk around in the vicinity of the casino without supervision .
by granting board authorisation , criminals will no longer be able to use the excuse of " social gambling " during criminal proceedings .
this will eliminate speculative arguments being raised on a case-by-case basis and substantially reduce the potential for abuse of the law .
mr speaker , to prove that there are some examples that one can take from the anc i am also going to be brief .
he concluded by summing up the evidence that was presented to him , and i quote from section 12.2.3.3 of the report :
mr speaker , when the matter was put on the agenda the new np tried to stop any discussion on the matter .
there are dp councillors and members , as well as ordinary citizens , who have supported the joint work of the anc and the dp on this matter .
this approval , to me , had its own irregularities and , of course , it also involved corruption by certain councillors who took the decision .
there was an acknowledgement by the ceo that the information given by the ratepayers was correct , and that something needed to be done .
we therefore would like the hon minister to use his political will in solving the problem in the south peninsula municipality .
mr speaker , again we have seen the hon member mr mckenzie playing to the gallery with the untruths .
] i then wrote a letter to the hon leader of the opposition , saying to him that i wanted to appoint a task team .
i have informed the premier 's office about the vacancy on the committee caused by mr wiley 's resignation from the cabinet .
i will call the task team together and when i receive the report i will give it to them after it has gone through the legal procedures .
the hon minister has , of course , taken the initiative himself and exposed the private sector interests on radio , but that is his affair .
on the radio he said it was because it was his baby and it had been his baby for 12 years .
it is going to be the province 's baby and they will all have to benefit , not just the hon minister and his little family trust .
the decision on where that convention centre was to be located , which the hon member mr strachan has just mentioned , was taken three years before that .
] they can carry on about racism , but out there on the ground the people of all communities actually do not care about the accusations .
beyond the fancy reasons , as part of the whole issue , did he ask for a three star hotel in order to protect his own five star hotels ?
mr speaker , all of us expose ourselves to risk on a daily basis ; otherwise we would not get out of bed in the morning .
par 3.2 of that code , which was drawn up by a committee chaired by the national minister of education , provides , and i quote :
mr speaker , urban terrorism , which seems to be on the increase , together with the high crime level , is becoming unbearable .
tomorrow the organisation free cape town from fear will begin a march at 12 : 00 in an effort to mobilise people and communities .
it would be the easiest thing to beat the drum to proclaim that our government and our country are hostile to muslims .
the national minister of safety and security is characterised as fuelling this sentiment by describing pagad as " islamic fundamentalists " .
the anc does not rule the western cape and it wants to destabilise the province in order to gain power ; hence it is bombing the province .
( 4 ) puts a monitoring mechanism in place which will ensure that the provincial cabinet be held accountable to the motion and applicable time-frame .
at silverstream strand , closer to cape town , until recently in the year 2000 brown and black had to pay to gain access to the beach .
i thought it was a good motion , but then i received this fax which the anc sent to a mr chris taute .
they try to present philosophical arguments on the issue of racism , which was a real let-down as far as the hon minister of social services is concerned .
] none of those in this cabinet can claim to know what the life of an individual person living in langa or guguletu or khayelitsha is .
those are not our words , mr speaker , but the words of the hon minister of education sitting across the floor there .
it was one of the most graphic examples of the bitter fruits of hatred south africa is reaping under the anc 's policy of re-racialisation .
this is an unpalatable truth for all of us who acknowledge and revere the tremendous reconciliatory role played by former president nelson mandela .
it was members of the da , like louis luyt , who dragged him into court and made him stand there to answer questions .
mr speaker , the hon minister of social services is quite right , it is true that racism is not unique to south africa .
we must identify people and send them there to empower them ; only then can we liberate them from shackles of apartheid .
( 4 ) deplores the fact that since the election in 1999 seven udm leaders were murdered in townships and no arrests have been made .
( 2 ) requests that all principals and heads of examination centres handle the examination papers entrusted to them with the utmost responsibility ;
in terms of the annual division of revenue act the following amounts totalling r121,3 million will be transferred from the national revenue fund .
mr speaker , in terms of the letter that i provided to you earlier , i would like to withdraw the subject from the order paper .
die burger quotes him as saying that he is not aware of inhuman brutality against farm workers and that everything is fine on the farms .
it is the responsibility of ourselves as mpps to see to it that employers and employees are not at the mercy of irresponsible political opportunists .
] an unintended consequence of this plan to redress landlessness is the likely displacement of up to 3 million workers and their dependants .
the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works showed us nice photographs - i do not know of which farm .
not long ago i had to take up a case with the hon member mr n m isaacs , who has a farm in the touws river area .
i propose that he rather calls for a debate about why his president has not yet responded to the drought disaster requests from the southern cape .
( i ) portfolio committee amendments to adult basic education and training bill [ b42a-2000 ] .
( vii ) chiropractors , homeopaths and allied health service professions second amendment bill [ b66-2000 ] .
the committee recommends that any uncertainty in this regard be clarified by the provincial administration as a matter of urgency in conjunction with all relevant role players .
( iv ) select committee amendment to adult basic education and training bill [ b42c-2000 ] .
( xii ) portfolio committee amendments to home loan and mortgage disclosure bill [ b53a-2000 ] .

vote 10 - social services ( auditor-general 's report [ pr 81 / 2000 - page 5 , paragraph 3.3 ] ) : transfer payments : subsidies
that the house wishes bafana bafana well in their match against nigeria today , and further expresses the hope that they will return as champions .
mr speaker , on a point of order : the hon minister of social services and poverty relief is now acting in total conflict with your ruling .
mr speaker , the hon minister of social services and poverty relief indicated that what we needed to do was deal with the facts .
i would like to ask the hon minister whether he is aware of why we came to the house in committee stage with those detailed questions .
the truth of the matter is that during a scof hearing the ruling coalition chose to go the path of bulldozing this piece of legislation .
the reality is that a complete absence of information about the rands and cents that were spent in this administration was masked by all the joking .
for the benefit of the hon member mr n m isaacs i quote from the letter to all public servants , which is headed , " dear colleague " .
only last year anc ministers in the national assembly never turned up when they were expected to answer questions in the house .
mr speaker , having said that , i want to try to prove conclusively what my colleagues in the anc were about yesterday .
hon members will recall that in my budget speech of 24 february 1999 i made certain promises , amongst others , the exercising of fiscal discipline .
i will never keep quiet when people in this province are being beaten and abused , and others are killed on the basis of their racial background .
] culture is important in order for us to understand one another , and we must make sure that we do understand each another .
mr speaker , it is not part my speech , but i want to share something that is on my heart today .
we as the acdp agree that we need to narrow and bridge the gap between the haves and the have-nots .
if hon members read the latest financial mail they will be staggered by the results of gambling just in this country .
it will , i am sure , boost tourism and trade and will be the forerunner of other interest offices in other key parts of the world .
i have said this before , and there is only one person on that side of the house who has taken me up on that .
] today , thanks to the da , south africans of all races now have a real choice and they are increasingly making that real choice .
hon members must remember that in the past elections in the western cape the np 's sunset clause of the 50 : 50 system was done away with .
they will remember that this 50 : 50 system of the old np benefited the whites in the north and the anc in the south .
in the 1994 elections , the anc received 33 % of the votes and the nnp / dp alliance received 58 % of the votes .
mr speaker , talking of that hon member who made such a fuss here about racism , his statement yesterday made it a sad day .
he knows quite well that already last year he agreed to the plan for the opening of our parliament on 6 february 2001 .
the election is over , and i am driven to write to you out of a deep concern about the anc 's performance , ...
the da proved at the polls that the people of this country are looking for a party with new solutions for all our people .
nepotism and injudicious staff appointments have led to towns such as ladismith needing to be rescued from thugs disguised in the robes of office .
when people from the rest of the country come to the western cape , then it is an " influx " of people from outside the province .
it is already partially under way and we already have participation and buy-in from the city , national retailers , recyclers and manufacturers .
it is not in the interests of anyone to exacerbate the divisions in a society already divided on racial and ethnic lines .
mr speaker , i want to propose that we all visit those people , talk to them and look at the way in which they live .
for some of them , they have been governing this province for a long time , but since 1994 there has been no change in manenberg .
whilst we try to change the security system , we are in a position to offer jobs to the people who live in manenberg .
they will have the same contradiction that the nnp had , because they cannot monitor the two constituencies that they have simultaneously .
we want to strengthen the hon premier 's hand , because the people of the western cape gave him a solid mandate for his vision .
the arms scandal , the aids dbcle and so on prove that the opposition are undermining the people 's aspirations and have lost the way to prosperity .
mr speaker , the remaining r51 000 has been allocated to offset increased expenditures by my department on the summer games ...
according to my information an amount of r3 million that should have been used for the olympic bid was not used during the last financial year .
we are a multiracial and multicultural province and we must never allow our rich diversity to become a dividing factor in our communities .
mr speaker , i congratulate the da on taking the unicity , as so eloquently highlighted by most da speakers .
and , yes , the anc did highlight the racist and wrongful practices still dominant on farms and rural towns in the western cape .
mr speaker , how can we go on boasting about an 80 % matric pass rate when incidents like this are still rife ?
when the elections come along , people like the da drive the fear of god into our people to keep them away from the anc .
in the metropolitan area a helicopter is now on 24-hour standby to combat any veld fire and the associated problems .
the province allocated r1,2 million , approved by the parliament , for that purpose , so that there would always be at least a private helicopter on standby .
if , however , a party wants to withdraw from a process voluntarily , because , it seems to me , the members do not like democracy ...
the da , however , says that it wants to participate , because irrespective of whether the da is in the majority or the minority , it can make a contribution .
( 3 ) whether the former minister is currently employed by the company operating chrysalis ; if so , how much is he being paid ; and
( 2 ) the concerns of the citizens in the south peninsula municipality that the provincial government seems unconcerned about this matter ;
mr speaker , i am talking about babies yet to be born who are at risk of contracting hiv from their mothers .
] this letter from the hon minister will now be added to karin reed 's file , because that is what is done in a bureaucracy .
the acdp believes there are enough common goals and the test will remain effective government in the interests of all the people .
thus , stimulating job creation initiatives is one of our priorities for the year 2000 , with a special focus on the youth , disabled people and women .
i think the time is ripe for us to utilise the new communication tools that are freely available in the field of information technology .
in the area of policy development , i want to hand a bouquet to the co-leader of the coalition government , the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism .
it has been with us since the days when teachers stood at the side of the road with placards reading : " do not interfere with my bread .
we had the sense to realise that unless our police are given more powers they will sit there as toothless bulldogs .
i want to congratulate the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation on his unselfish efforts to make a success of safety and security .
unfortunately the hon minister of education is not present in the house at the moment but the other hon members can tell her .
mr speaker , i think that it does apply to the point that i would like to make , if you would allow me .
i have already made a paradigm shift in my portfolio , moving it from focusing on conservation to focusing on human rights and socio-economic issues .
] we therefore have a common goal and common objectives , but our opinions , strategies , policies and methods to achieve these goals may differ .
the coalition partners also have their differences in approach and do not necessarily always have the same opinion on how best to achieve results .
mr speaker , this government is based on the faith that the majority of people put in us to provide them with an alternative .
i want to thank the hon member mr marais for his proposal at last week 's nacosa workshop of a separate budget vote for hiv / aids .
mr speaker , the hon member here did not open his mouth when the hon member mr mckenzie was talking about the election result .
madam speaker , i would like to address the house on the achievements that the hon premier spoke about when he delivered his opening address .
madam speaker , the hon premier stated that unemployment in the western cape is half that of the rest of the country .
the western cape plays host to some of the most exciting growth points in the whole of africa , including agriculture , tourism , manufacturing and trade .
the western cape 's 4,3 million people represent another massive asset , with the highest percentage of people with post-school qualifications and technical skills in south africa .
ironically , the facts that so many crimes in the poorer communities are familiarity crimes and that powerful vigilante movements have taken over the stage point to a solution .
the only reply she could give was that she had a shortage of staff and directors to draw up that business plan .
] yes , if hon members say that corruption lives , then it lives on that side of the house , in the other provinces , in the anc .
it is our responsibility as leaders to convey this message of positivism to our electorates out there with courage and conviction .
they refused that ; they treated the hon premier 's overtures with contempt , and now they are putting out feelers .
we will register every new vehicle that goes onto our roads from 1 november 2000 so that they make their contribution to the fiscus too .
mr speaker , my problem with the new np / dp alliance is that they really would like to sweep these issues under the carpet .
the terrible act of child abuse hurts the child , and that child grows up with it because he or she is not able to speak about it .
i am not absolutely sure that anybody can say here today , " i am a proud anything , " other than white people .
the biggest lie that the anc perpetuates is that the coalition government - and specifically the dp - does not care about the poor .
mr speaker , that is why these destitute children are coming to the western cape in their thousands , desperate for a place in western cape schools .
we say that the money that those hon members want to allocate to the elections should be given to the iec .
i would like to thank the hon premier for the support he gave in his address with regard to crime prevention operations in this province .
she graced us with her presence and was on the speakers ' list , but unfortunately declined to take us up on her own desire .
when the anc get into a position which traditionally was meant to be neutral , they cannot keep their subjective attitudes out of it .
ms pandor then says that the constant harping for more power - without getting into specifics - is becoming very irritating .
the department of justice is not even paying its bills to those who stand pro deo to represent the poorest of the poor .
i am probably going to be called before the auditor-general for paying these people , because i am not entitled to do so .
in his pgc adopted a resolution that at the local government level there should be local youth councils who to look into youth interests at that level .
] and while the hon premier was inspecting a guard of honour by the united reformed church youth brigade , there was a demonstration in progress .
mr speaker , a great fuss has been made about the fact that the hon premier did not speak about hiv / aids in his opening address .
this is important because our key strategy in the fight against aids is to encourage people to undergo voluntary testing and counselling .
the department is considering a proposal from mediine sans frontiers , doctors without borders , which is aimed at bolstering the mother-to-child-transmission programme in khayelitsha .
i will overexpend and document it to say to whomever that we will make the necessary plans to deal with that .
mr speaker , in the face of this the beleaguered hon premier kept on referring to the quality of the life of the citizens of the province .
we are seriously concerned that the latest crime statistics from the saps show that crime is now at its highest level since 1994 .
of the 323 police officers assigned to mitchells plain , 218 perform desk duties only , including 30 police officers who work at the magistrates ' court .
madam speaker , that makes one think of the police van in which steve biko had to travel on that unforgettable night in september 1977 .
the hon member mr fransman told us about a certain mr baadjies who was walking down the road and apparently assaulted .
when the hon minister 's cabinet colleague spoke about powers , and about what the anc had said , he omitted to say ...
he went on to talk about the growing economy , but what he failed to mention was the investment strike by big business .
the amounts set side for this are r45,561 million in the 2000-01 financial year , r7,872 million in the 2001-02 financial year and r30,026 million in the 2002-03 financial year .
total provincial revenue , comprising total national payments of r10,833 billion plus provincial own revenue of r516,539 million , amounts to r11,350 billion for the 2000-01 financial year , ...
our own indebtedness has been substantially reduced over the mtef period due to an additional allocation of r139,4 million for this purpose in the 1999-2000 adjustments estimate .
at the institutional level , it is possible that the previous absence of incentives for revenue generation has perhaps contributed to below-potential performance in revenue generation .
i indicated earlier on the actual figure which we will eventually receive and which will be dealt with in the adjustments estimate with regard to housing .
perhaps the hon member mr dugmore is suggesting that i should take the r11 million in total and put it on the red .
in terms of rule 168 ( 1 ) i refer the bill and relevant papers to the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling for consideration .
report dated 22 october 1999 of the standing committee on public accounts in respect of the following auditor-general reports on ( tabling document no .
medical supplies aimed mainly at preventing cholera and malaria outbreaks will be supplied on a cost recovery basis if necessary .
the budget document , which is the most important document placed before this house every year , is a factual rendition of the current financial state .
mr speaker , i am very pleased that the hon premier today raised the issue of help that we will be giving to mpumalanga .
i am very pleased that the dp over the weekend finally realised that there is a problem with apartheid that needs to be redressed .
it is my job to empower the people of this province ; because you guys will not do it , i have to do it .
on both occasions the hon minister lost her cool with the committee , showed her disrespect and severely lost her temper in that regard .
it is clear to me that the anc is purposefully whipping up racial division in the western cape in an attempt to win control of the province .
any person in the western cape who takes the trouble to move around will agree that the number of inhabitants in the metropole has increased dramatically .
they carry on complaining while they know for a fact that the r10 million is a grant , on condition that there is a business plan .
mr speaker , with regard to the casino , sun west , it is most disturbing to hear rumours , which have a tendency to be true .
we asked right at the beginning , when discussing the issue of casinos , that they should provide job creation for the western cape .
there is a great deal of construction work to be done but our people are turned away because the companies have twinned with another company in gauteng .
i want to support the example further so that we do not get the idea that it is only the schools at lamberts bay that have to amalgamate .
it is not my intention to deal with the individual items raised in the scof report that we have before us today .
it is a tax , because any money that is put into the fiscus , in whichever way it is done , is a tax .
i get the cake and with my 4,6 % i can only put a very thin layer of icing on the approximately 95 % .
madam chairperson , the province of the western cape 's national youth commissioner , appointed in november last year , is now heading the provincial youth desk .
this despicable insensitivity for others , be it their lives , their honour or their belongings , has grown like a cancer in the south african society .
whilst systems and procedures are still important , control measures now monitor the quality , effectivity and efficiency of services to ensure the best value for money .
once again , i invite the anc to join with us , and the rest of the world , in the 21st century .
in the process heads of departments have been authorised to accept full accountability with regard to the activities of their departments with effect from 1 april 2000 .
i would like to tell the hon member ms vantura that her speech today touched my heart - it was a good one .
i think we need to be honest and realistic , because we are dealing with the lives of people here ; we are not playing cards .
the challenge facing us is not on which documents we produce , but in how we translate those documents into reality .
the contemplated training initiatives such as the junior leadership programme and training of personnel to facilitate affirmative action will be closely monitored and vehemently supported .
she invited me to address an open meeting of more than 300 abused women and women who had been subjected to violence .
i have also taken cognisance of what was said by the hon member mr silke , especially with regard to the policy he referred to .
we committed ourselves this morning - my director committed herself this morning in the presence of hon members - to starting our own .
i am serious about ensuring , if the hon premier keeps me in my post , that transformation is finalised this year .
then i asked the other question , one which i asked a long time ago and for which i have still received no answer .
we have an agreement with the province of upper austria , and the province of upper austria does not have a coalition government , because phringer won on his own .
report of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling , on the western cape appropriation bill [ b 5-2000 ] , dated 3 march 2000 , as follows :
the committee expresses its concern at the additional costs in the tender of the hospital information system ( his ) , as well as the legal costs related to it .
legal assistance to standing committees has always been , and remains , in my opinion , the responsibility of the original drafter of the legislation and the province 's legal services .
we trust that part of the funds earmarked for capital projects over the next two years will be utilised for these actions .
i want to thank fedics for the outstanding service and sponsorships that they have provided over five years in respect of catering for parliament .
] even if we invited them - and there would be a few who could not come - our seating would be limited .
if a minister has a very important statement to make , we can create a timeslot , as we do for questions and interpellations and for motions .
the provincial parliament needs the capacity to allow hon members of this house to fulfil their constitutional responsibilities .
for example , the members ' parking - i think the speaker referred to this issue - has been on the agenda for too long .
in the standing committee on economic development - of which i am the chairperson - we have six sections within the ambit of that portfolio .
we must realise that with the coming into being of the unicity - the big municipal council of 180 members - we will really have to market ourselves .
i would like to ask who has the right of access to those photographs to see who has applied for registration .
it is very interesting that this hon member did not respond again about the legal opinion and the tender board which we were talking about just then .
( 1 ) what is the total estimated cost of the damage incurred by the bush fires in the province during the month of january 2000 ;
( c ) if costs of damage were to include environmental damage , it may be impossible to quantify .
specifically if a new school is being opened , is it clear that people who are on the redeployment list must be allocated to such a school ?
mr speaker , i want to suggest that if this interpellation had not been on the question paper today we would not have seen the light of day of this annual report .
mr speaker , it pleases me to see that the hon member ms essop is out of her home environment and back with us !
( a ) the only traffic training centre in the province is the gene louw college at brackenfell , which falls under the control of the province .
no , unspent funds at national health are not allocated to the provinces and no additional funds were therefore allocated to programmes and projects .
normally in the case of a saving the unspent funds will be returned to national treasury and earmarked for roll-over in the next financial year if the funding is still required .
mr speaker , i can simply say that the process that was followed was in terms of the law governing the appointment of the tender board .
departmentally names came forward originally , i asked them to go back and eventually we decided on this particular process .
all completed applications are submitted to the funding committee of the western cape cultural commission with recommendations based on the approved criteria for consideration .
this committee meets every fortnight and considers applications according to the guidelines and criteria that the western cape cultural commission approved earlier this year .
factors that are taken into account include aspects such as the demography of the western cape , gender equity , disability and participation by previously disadvantaged communities .
i am notified in writing of the recommendation of the funding committee of the western cape cultural commission , as well as the conditions that will apply .
i shall , notwithstanding the foregoing , always do my duty by again going to address the bonteheuwel community , whether asked in my official capacity or otherwise .
however , it is the ability of the parties that came on board in order to nurse the project that has allowed the actual implementation date to be adhered to .
the provincial transport department took over the duty of collecting accident statistics for the province from the national department as from 1 october 1999 .
we are sorry , but i cannot make a promise to the hon member that the province will be able to do something about this .
for me to remember , among the millions things that i have to remember , how many of these tlcs have been requested or not is impossible .
i am almost sure that if it was recommended by our legal department and it was necessary to do it , i would have done it .
the fact is that the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation has the responsibility to give leadership to members of the saps .
this is a case of a group of sex workers who laid certain charges , and the hon minister spelt out what he did about it .
this is the essence of the south african police service act and of the constitution , and that is why the commissioner has certain powers .
i do not think that the hon minister has achieved great success in his effort to prove that we treat people in the same way .
however , we have compiled a comprehensive database of products and services and these are published on the western cape tourism internet page and marketing guides .
i would like to mention that we have access to , and were part of , the process to compile a comprehensive tourism infrastructure framework .
the new school of thought , to replace certain police officials in the saps with security personnel , is national police policy and the provincial protection service is unfortunately compelled to adhere thereto .
mr speaker , my follow-up question is whether the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism supports the submission that was made by his department .
mr speaker , if they fall within our functions , which labour does not , we will happily deal with them .
mr speaker , what i think politically has absolutely nothing to do with the hon member , so the question is irrelevant .
] as far as i am concerned , we speak of the african renaissance , but do any of the hon members over there know what the african renaissance is ?
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon premier whether he thinks that the situation in zimbabwe is affecting the economy in this province .
this is not by criticising zimbabwe , but by our leaders saying that we will not allow land invasion in our own country .
i believe that there are a lot of factors politically that are not making them come the way we thought they would after 1994 .
the hon minister does not indicate , however , that the current percentages in terms of white male representivity in the province will not be redressed .
mr speaker , we are slowly but surely tracking down the man and lady who gave that hon member such good information .
secondly , i want to know whether , in regard to the 136 schools , there were any objections to the closure of such schools that were made .
mr speaker , given the fact that the hon minister of education says that amalgamation does take place in certain cases , lamberts bay is a reality .
sir , when amalgamation takes place and the parents have a choice and discussions have to take place in every town , we take those discussions very seriously .
( 1 ) ( a ) to ( c ) the report for the period 1994-98 to be tabled in the provincial parliament has been submitted .
i wanted the act to come into effect on 1 may , because 1 may is a very special day on our calendar .
i request the hon member mr ozinsky to proceed in accordance with the western cape constitution until such time as we have finalised the matter .
mr speaker , on a point of order : could we just be reminded as to what would happen to the unanswered questions 10 to 18 .
in addition , centrally negotiated salary increases exceeded inflation and so that personnel costs have risen despite the loss of large numbers of staff .
the department is addressing the capital funding of the cmd as well as opportunities for direct delivery of medicines from manufacturers to our institutions .
( a ) the salary of the former minister of social services and poverty relief was not adjusted because of an administrative oversight .
transport pay subsidies to the golden arrow bus services , in terms of the company 's current interim contract which ends in may 2000 .
golden arrow is one party to the contract and the branch : transport , together with the national department of transport , constitute the other party .
in the absence of the required legislation the western cape tender board , with the approval of the provincial cabinet , implemented the preference procurement policy as an interim measure .
this act stipulates that an organ of state must determine its preferential procurement policy and implement it within the framework stipulated in the act .
there are far more details to a policy than just a formula , for the information of the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism .
there is a shortage of pharmacists throughout south africa and there are many new institutions employing pharmacists which can offer a far more attractive remuneration package .
( 2 ) there is no system to keep track of patients who leave without being attended to .
mr speaker , i mention this because the question was put to me as minister of transport and as minister of sport and recreation .
mr speaker , when we act we must act within the laws of the land and in this case that was indeed done .
( 1 ) whether the inter-ministerial committee on aids is still functioning ; if not , why not ; if so , what are the details of its programme ;
the reply to sections ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) of the question is that the province is not in possession of the information .
correctional supervision is a national competency and the hon member mr r williams should address these questions to the national minister of correctional services .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon minister of health to give us a breakdown of the cost per health facility .
( 1 ) the dial-a-ride project was initiated as an olympic public transport demonstration project , by the cmc and not by my department .
however , the wced is investigating ways and means of providing all schools with such kits within the hiv / aids budget .
no schools were specifically provided though with first aid kits in relation to the national schools hiv / aids week ; this had been done prior to that .
provision has been made for the establishment of health advisory committees within the school structures , with representatives of principals , educators , learners , governing body members and parents .
mr speaker , i cannot give the hon member mr jacobs exact statistics because i do not have them with me .
] we are now busy with the new one , but as mr mandela says , if one goes into something new , there will be teething problems .
mr speaker , let me begin by wishing all hon members of the provincial parliament a very happy and successful new year .
we meet here today against a national backdrop of rising unemployment , wide-spread poverty , stubbornly high levels of crime and the rapid spread of hiv / aids .
the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism will be working closely with the regions to make this province an international number one destination .
not only is our european , american , and asian tourist trade increasing , but we are also getting more and more visitors from the african continent .
in the same vein , our new cape manufacturing advisory centre will be used to assist and develop small and medium businesses throughout the province .
the standing committee also expressed its opinion of the fact that we did not have the details of vote 2 - provincial parliament before us .
another issue that i want to highlight is the amount of some r37 million that was apportioned to sita for the payment of accounts .
mr speaker , firstly , i wish to congratulate mr ismay on taking up the chief directorate while dr stegmann is on study leave .
could the hon minister perhaps check to see that those costs are fixed and that we have no problems regarding that .
mr speaker , this concludes my remarks concerning funds which have become available to the province from the national government .
a total of r40,6 million was withheld from the transferring votes and the same amount subsequently reallocated to the votes to which the functions shifted .
report of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling on the western cape second adjustments appropriation bill [ b13-2000 ] , dated 1 february 2001 , as follows :
well , their leadership is terrible , because they called the hon member mr dugmore back from his honeymoon to help fill their benches .
their wild attempts at character assassination have failed , as they have failed in the past with hernus kriel and dr niel barnard .
sometimes i feel that the people in the western cape should realise what a competent teaching corps we have , who can achieve the results we have obtained .
let me warn the hon leader of the opposition that his leadership , like that of chris nissen was , is under threat from his members .
mr speaker , i do not always differ with the hon leader of the opposition and i would gladly welcome a conference on racism to be held in the western cape .
in the letter mr mabaso perpetuated the lie or the untruth that i do not care about the people of langa or guguletu .
i will allow the hon leader of the opposition to put his case , but he is dragging it out and it is taking a little too long .
if he does not want to put a substantive motion to the house , or a request , then i will have to stop him within the next few seconds .
mr speaker , yes , spillage did not only occur in november ; there was one case on 10 january and one on 14 march this year .
] of course , i welcome that approval so that we can move forward , but i really did not think that this was his territory .
mr speaker , it was only 15 minutes ago that i heard from the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs as to the completion of the eia report .
it is correct that it is the communities of khayelitsha , blue downs , kuils river , delft and eerste river , and all the sewage flows to that specific area .
this provincial government requested the west coast district council on 26 november 1998 to take the necessary steps to enforce the conditions .
( 1 ) whether municipalities would levy different types of rates in the 2000-01 financial year for municipalities ; if not , why not ; if so , what different types ;
i am sure that a market-related rental for a particular house would depend on its locality , as it does in the market .
i am informed that parts of our department have contact , particularly by way of giving technical support and backup to that process .
mr speaker , i am sure that the new hon minister of social services would be prepared to have a discussion in this regard .
( 3 ) the application of tender procedures is not relevant , as the assets were transferred to schools where they were needed and could be used .
( 4 ) what is the policy of the department with regard to the driving of vehicles on beaches , such as the beach at grotto bay ?
( 1 ) as far as we know , no houses have been rebuilt following the proclamation of the iem regulations under the nature conservation act .
if the hon member 's question is whether i have discussed the williams case with any judge or anybody else the answer is , absolutely not .
i met with the equivalent of our gambling board , the university of nevada and their gambling experts and visited a number of casinos .
i must say that what i learnt in las vegas was what not to do , rather than what to do .
at the behest of the department 's clients the office of the tender board was restructured to make provision for the increased complexity of the procurement function .
forty-three years of my life have been spent knocking in vain - patiently , moderately and modestly - at a closed and barred door .
the provincial demographic statistics for the western cape of 17,8 % black people , 58 % coloured people and 23,9 % whites are not reflected in this department .
i would firstly like to say that the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation should not impose his standards on me .
madam chairperson , on a point of order : i am aware of a rule stating that we are not supposed to read our speeches .
i even withheld the motion from the house so that they could reach consensus , but today the anc has confirmed an agenda that they have .
then it is also about the safeguarding and management of the assets , which is one of the key points that come out of this performance management legislation .
madam chairperson , i want to align myself with the hon member mr strachan about the speech that was made by the hon member mr ismail .
i am not sure about this , and at the same time the hon minister went on to say that we in this province are better off .
madam chairperson , let me say that in scopa we were informed about existing affirmative action that has been confirmed in the department .
madam chairperson , i do not want to move onto the political terrain today , but would rather concentrate on the debate on vote 3 - finance .
the new np in the western cape regards clean , sound financial administration as a prerequisite to the upholding of the province 's values and norms .
i would like to read from their introduction to the gambling board where they spoke about economic opportunities for previously disadvantaged communities , and i quote :
] no matter how angry aunt bucky is , he sacked her because he was not satisfied with what had happened there .
madam chairperson , i want to congratulate the hon minister of finance and development planning on his budget speech and to refer to a few points in that speech .
] what i want to say to that hon member , who wants to continue with his barrage of interjections , is that if he listens , he will learn .
i have given an undertaking that this province is going to have a procurement policy which , i believe , should be far ahead of any other province in south africa .
judging from what i saw in the files , i would have liked to see the tender given according to the department 's recommendation .
one of the government 's three partners , cosatu , has already said that the country 's high level of crime is due to the high rate of unemployment .
a growth of 3,5 % , which the national minister of finance estimated for this year , would create only 75 000 jobs .
we have to awaken that specific sleeping giant to become involved on a more regular basis and not only when a crisis develops .
furthermore it is expected of every member of the management committee to initiate and lead at least two projects that are dependent on multi-agency cooperation .
no , they are the opening lines in a different newspaper report in die burger of the same date under the heading , " nnp support declining since election poll " .
madam chairperson , the new np , and the dp in particular , have a tremendous passion for comparing our province with other provinces in this country .
the anc welcomes the degree of recognition already accorded to neighbourhood watches but must add immediately that not enough has yet been done .
madam chairperson , the support of our community police forums is also welcomed , but in this regard , too , we are not entirely where we ought to be .
it is further alleged in that report that at least 80 % of correctional services staff have relatives working for the department .
with over 200 policemen murdered each year in south africa , it is not surprising that morale amongst the police force is low .
may i say at this juncture that it is a delight for me here to wish the hon minister of education a very happy birthday .
mr chairperson , one of the strategic objectives of the department is the launching of an investigation into the levels of service delivery at specific community service centres .
this would help to create more confidence among the communities and at the same time require a greater degree of accountability of the provincial minister of community safety .
at the same time there are indeed certain members of the police service who , when they are disciplined , seek to publicise the matter as a racial incident .
one problem area in my constituency that requires the urgent attention of the saps is the high incidence of theft of ostrich eggs and baby ostriches on farms .
mr chairperson , once again i want to extend my sincere thanks to the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation and his team for their availability at all times .
if there is one department and one vote that we will not allow to be politicised , it is this department and this vote .
we need to create an enabling environment to recruit dedicated servants - an environment with proper training , better working conditions , decent working hours , and overtime remuneration .
it is shocking that after five years , none of those policemen has a pension to fall back on , even though they wear the same uniform as police officers .
madam chairperson , i think it is critically important that , notwithstanding what has been said in the house today , the strategy of the anc should be exposed .
at this stage , let me say that an area like oudtshoorn , with its fantastic sport infrastructure , would lend itself tremendously to a winter training facility for european countries .
the western cape education department takes responsibility for physical education , but not all schools provide physical education , although it is compulsory on the curriculum .
at least they managed to come up with a business plan , unlike other ministries that do not have such a plan .
i am sure the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism will hear about this , as he always has a problem with us fighting racism .
it is these cyclists who are going to help to raise money for the hon minister of transport and works to repair chapmans peak drive .
their entry fees will end up in the hands of the poorest of the poor through the charities supported by the organisers of the race .
the hon minister in the office of the premier is given all the powers to deal with youth affairs , but she does not have a plan .
" baby jake " mathlala , penny heyns , benni mccarthy ; i salute all of them , because we are here today because of their own special efforts .
madam chairperson , it is a great pleasure for me to say a few words in the debate on the vote regarding sport and recreation .
madam chairperson , for too long we have seen that sport and recreation are an " add-on " ; that they are discussed as something additional .
we can give them a pair of flippers and they can wear wings ; it is the best cardio-vascular activity , which is low impact and injury free .
if the hon member knows of any codes that do not submit business plans but receive money from us , he should bring it to my attention .
my administration , in cooperation with the department of home affairs and the independent electoral commission , is involved in this year 's most important project - local election 2000 .
my address before the assembly of european regions in lyon , france has resulted in the 26 member states giving the western cape government special guest status .
the horrifying account of frail , incapacitated old people being subjected to verbal and serious physical abuse has sickened me to the core .
mr speaker , i welcome president mbeki 's reference in his address on friday to his government 's commitment to step up the fight against crime .
we will endeavour to transform them into assets of society and mould them into strong role models that others can follow .
mr speaker , from 15 january to 23 january 2000 we had 365 fires in the province , of which 207 were in the metropole .
mr speaker , we should be proud in our diversity , but there is still the awful reality that there are racial divisions , even colour-line politics .
they are known as the three ts : time , teacher and text .
the main difference between good and bad teachers is the extent to which they take responsibility and consider themselves accountable for the performance of their learners .
organisation and work study has already begun the functional analysis of the wced and should complete the technical processes by the end of april .
a new and essential area of curriculum focus is the further education and training band , generally known as grades 10 , 11 and 12 .
criminals and vandals cannot move around with impunity in a community that rejects them and actively seeks to curb them .
this will enable us to ensure that all our disadvantaged schools have water , electricity and flush toilets , wherever possible .
in the first phase of the telecommunications project begun last year , we supplied a basic computer system and an internet connection to 198 disadvantaged schools .
i often think that the hon minister 's approach to educational change is far too mechanical in dealing with these things .
mr chairperson , education is supposed to be the most important building block on which the future of all south africans and the country is to be based .
we are implementing national legislation , however good or bad it may be , and if it boomerangs , we can stand back and say , " this is national legislation .
on occasion i expressed the idea that we should determine whether we could not introduce some penalisation factor in the interests of extending a helping hand .
we could go to a community like elsies river and look at the valhalla secondary school , and at fairmont college in goodwood , just across the railway line .
madam chairperson , we can pat one another on the back and hand out tributes , but there are certain realities that we simply cannot ignore .
we are past the time when the poor performance of pupils could be blamed solely on circumstances at home , or on apartheid .
this school that i am going to speak about will serve as a yardstick in respect of what is happening in high schools in the disadvantaged areas .
the pupils with behavioural problems who are currently in mainstream schools will in the first instance be supported in those schools in an effort to bridge their problems .
i immediately wrote to the hon minister of health and he informed me yesterday that they were definitely going to change that system this very year .
however much they try and whatever effort they make , they still say to me in despair all over the place : " what must we do ?
the strategic plans of every directorate and institution are being developed to focus more specifically than before on strategic and operating objectives , responsible persons and target dates .
rationalisation and consolidation of rehabilitation services in a new rehabilitation centre based at the conradie hospital are envisaged for the year 2000 .
the " r " in " service " stands for " revenue generation " , maybe the most important part for health in the coming 24 months .
the " v " in " service " stands for " visible improvement and prevention and control measures in hiv / aids and tb " .
we have seen what it has done in europe , and we shall ensure that our staff in the branch : health are given the necessary influenza injections .
in the coming year we will also be exploring a variety of other opportunities for public / private partnerships in order to allow for greater efficiencies in our services .
we are , for example , investigating the possibility of bringing in private sector contractors for cleaning services in the non-clinical areas of our larger institutions .
it was prof nicky padiachi , the dean at the university of cape town , who said : " we do have the best officials in africa .
nationally we seem to be wasting time establishing committees , whereas our focus should be on the plan of action ahead .
madam chairperson , good nutrition is basic to development and is of fundamental importance in order to improve health status , especially that of vulnerable groups .
it is unfortunate that this department , in fact , generates only 3 % of its own revenue , and that amount has decreased over the past three years .
it is important that the branch retains key professional staff , and i understand that there are several initiatives under way to secure this .
our state hospitals are overflowing with indigent patients , causing a flight of the more affluent patients to private hospitals and reducing our income revenue even further .
they are too busy fighting the elements - rain , wind , hunger , disease and malnutrition - to care anyway .
i said when i replied to the hon minister 's 100 day vision speech on 13 september , 1999 that we should wait until march 2000 .
today he said exactly the same thing he said then , that the retention had to be increased by 50 % to 100 % .
he said then , and here he should receive some credit , that the equipment backlog was r300 million and growing .
i do not think that that falls within our budget , but i think the hon member is correct .
special report of the auditor-general on the former management boards in rural areas ( transitional councils ) in the province of the western cape [ pr 24 / 2000 ] .
its mission is to facilitate the social safety net for the poor , the vulnerable and those with special needs in a developmental manner .
seeing that there is some money available from the national side , we will have to see whether we can prolong the phasing out of this specific programme .
the limitation of this view has slowly given way to the acknowledgement that the hiv epidemic is a complex issue , affecting all sectors of society .
mr chairperson , however good this department may sound and is starting to look , there are a few areas that we must address .
the ngos and cbos who are already out there need to be strengthened and financially and materially assisted with those problems facing us .
the building blocks are ready and now the house in which our children will live , learn and grow to be the future citizens of south africa must be built .
she goes on to say that , of course , she did not have a budget in that year but , and i quote from col 652 :
they need the money , yet , we have given an hon minister of very slow delivery and non-performance a budget of r10 million .
poverty eradication should be one of the key purposes of the south african state if it is to remain credible in the eyes of its people .
the only answer i can provide at this stage is that it says in the bible , " do not answer a fool according to his folly .
once again , as is her custom , she made a very good contribution particularly with reference to hiv / aids and the role to be played there .
i get the impression , when listening to all hon members , that to address poverty we will have to do it holistically .
i believe he is a member of the action group in that specific area , and i received a notice from him in this regard .
madam chairperson , a few weeks ago i was preparing myself to stand before you today with a heavy heart and very bad news .
although the claims for the 1999-2000 financial year have not all been submitted yet , all the indications are that the spending for this financial year will amount to approximately r360 million .
for many years my department was facilitating the formulation and adoption of such a policy with the cape metropolitan council and the six metropolitan local councils .
madam chairperson , it has become increasingly clear over the past year that the middle-income group is being neglected as far as the provision of housing is concerned .
it is therefore a pleasure to be able to announce that there is currently a project in place that focuses on this group of beneficiaries .
the reason for this policy was to promote the maximum gearing of public sector investment and to promote maximum participation by the private sector in housing development .
since messrs slabbert and bester are in the process of selling the province 's assets , why does the housing fund not get money from the usury fund ?
these homes are built close to each other without any access for fire-fighting or medical services which in many cases leads to the loss of unnecessary lives .
it is our firm belief as the anc that this kind of approach can never solve the problems facing humanity today .
] i want to ask the hon minister in his reply to comment on whether there were such moves at some stage or not .
] i would like to tell the hon member mr winde that there are people whose names have been on the waiting-list for more than 20 years .
this developer continues to fill in subsidy forms in these communities , and people are hoping that one day they will have shelter over their heads .
he is a member of the standing committee and knows that it is a matter for local government , not one falling under my department .
the idea , however , is for us to create a high-density development so that we can bring as many people as possible closer to their workplaces and also to the city .
when i say " advise " , it sounds as if a bunch of information is going to come through and i can accept or not accept it .
i will , of course , also accept the advice of the unicity commission and the district transformation forums in this regard , not because i must , but because i would like to .
we can walk tall because the hon minister conveys the message from the western cape even in minmec , where he is in the minority .
having listened to the hon minister 's budget speech , i immediately turned to the overview furnished in the gold book .
the hon minister saw how the members of this house , particularly in scof , were carrying on and wanted to know where everyone stood with transformation .
those hon members are so far away and he is so far above them that they did not understand these things he mentioned .
unfortunately , the tendency in this province has been to ascribe these problems mainly to the shortcomings or vagaries of the political functionaries , the councillors .
] declaring a disaster means nothing unless there are funds to repair the damage caused by the disaster .
i would like to complement the hon minister on his proactive approach to the possible appointment of a town clerk to oversee the transition process lying ahead .
even the most cursory glance at the composition of personnel within development planning will indicate that we still fall woefully short when it comes to racial representivity .
it is our intention to make a manual on bioregional planning available to local authorities and other key role-players within the next two to three weeks .
most , if not all , of these applications for development are situated on coastal agricultural land between existing developed nodes such as coastal towns and settlements .
madam chairperson , the aim of the department of development planning is basically to support , monitor and regulate development planning in the provincial and local government spheres .
] i have heard that tomorrow four hon ministers will be admitting themselves to - sorry , my mistake , they will be visiting - valkenberg .
mr chairperson , i further noted transfer payments allocated to the knysna western heads and environment local structure plan .
we sometimes need to get development on stream , and if we are going to have to consult a wide spectrum of people , there will always be a delay .
mr chairperson , i think that it has been indicated repeatedly , both in standing committee meetings and in the house , that the territories planning ordinance is unconstitutional .
my practical experience in local government is that such a department may link up better with a department like that of local government .
every time i have dealt with issues of transformation and affirmative action in this house , i have been met with resistance and lots of resentment .
i look at the hon minister 's key measurables and i think perhaps it has become time to remove some of the red tape .
i actually asked the chairperson whether he would like me to do it , particularly in view of the late hour .
it is important to note that it falls under the head of the department of housing , local government and planning , mr africa .
the hon member can charge consultancy fees , but i believe the deputy speaker will tell her that she is not allowed to .
wuppertal and other historic rural settlements will continue to be assisted to promote the sustainability of their rural communities through cultural and ecotourism .
on behalf of the members of the standing committee i want to wish her a very blessed period of rest , when she retires on 31 march 2000 .
however , the very same cmc that tries to educate people about these issues is responsible for polluting the kuils river and the eerste river .
in the past four months , according to my calculations , it has happened at least three times that they have pumped raw sewerage straight into those rivers .
the concept of freedom of expression has become a licence to " entertain " people and people 's boundaries have been intruded on .
unlike the hon member mr williams , i do not wish her a peaceful , restful retirement ; go out there and have fun , you deserve it !
i tried to find out what the tbhc is , but just judging from the kind of activities they are involved in , it sounds like a type of home economics organisation .
whenever i make a speech in the house , i find the hon member very supportive of what i say .
some confusion may also have arisen about the role of the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation regarding fires .
as regards the commissioner for the environment , i said in the house the other day that he would be appointed before the end of this current year .
i would also like to invite the hon member to make any suggestions he may have in respect of addressing this independence .
out-of-school educational programmes , especially on human and natural sciences , are part of the educational programme of the department at museums and cultural programmes , and at reserves .
( 1 ) in the afrikaans text , on page 43 , in line 35 , to omit " [ -en omgewings ] " and to substitute " -en omgewings " .
( 2 ) in the afrikaans text , on page 43 , in line 36 , to omit " [ -en omgewings ] " and to substitute " -en omgewings " .
we hope that at a future stage those regulations will be changed so that the hon member mr gelderblom will be able to use ostriches to their full potential .
mr speaker , that is why we are in parliament , so that we can carry on and show who those members really and truly are .
after in-depth investigations , the contractor eventually started construction work at uniondale in february 1998 , and adopted a labour-intensive approach using local labour .
as regards the utilisation of state motor transport , a number of significant developments have been tackled recently in order to improve the quality of the service and the scope of utilisation of state vehicles .
madam chairperson , the branch : works is based on modern business principles , in that it identifies its core focus .
we did not know about these programmes , although the hon member mr ramatlakane did raise it in the standing committee on economic development .
i am not sure why it was moved from the national department of public works to transport - perhaps that was an internal arrangement .
it was again mentioned today in the standing committee on economic development that the founding document regarding the mta appeared in january 1998 .
the savings the city will make from not having to provide parking alone will be more than the capital costs of an extensive light rail system .
where the important vinkrivier road turns in and at the sales office of the rooiberg co-operative cellars , he came to listen to people 's representations .
madam chairperson , i have already discussed with the hon minister regulation 207 of the road traffic act , 1989 ( act 29 of 1989 ) .
the study conducted with regard to the public works programme has revealed that most jobs have been created through government-driven programmes .
a budget of this nature could provide an opportunity to develop programmes for rehabilitation and maintenance of the cape gravel road network in particular .
support must be given to small and medium enterprises in four main areas : access to advice ; access to training ; bridging finance / finance , and adjustment of contract documents .
madam chairperson , i want to link up immediately with the previous speaker who extended his thanks to the chief director of transport , mr mike spence .
they came to us in the western cape and said we had 10 days to give them a mandate for the central parliament .
in the west coast district council area alone there are almost 723 km of tarred main roads and subordinate roads as against a colossal 900 km of gravel roads in the same categories .
i also ask that they do not come in a helicopter , but in a car the suspension of which is not that good , ...
however , if the road network does not improve , all these job opportunities that could be created by agriculture and the tourist industry will be phased out and will come to nothing .
he mentioned to me that in only one year he had sustained damage to the amount of r150 000 to his vehicles on that road .
we in the karoo and the little karoo are proud of the hon minister because he always cares and he is always available when we contact him .
let us wait until the auditor-general has investigated the 10 % increase in licence fees of mpumalanga ; after that it will probably be increased by 30 % .
mr chairperson , better roads , good maintenance and better training at all levels of the construction industry are to me the outstanding characteristics of the transport budget .
if we have moved away from the constitution , we must admit that the constitution demands that we should have the department renamed " public works " .
( 1 ) how many emerging companies are there on the affirmative business enterprises ( abe ) list compiled for public works tenders ;
he is very positive about the idea , as are those involved in kwazulu-natal , mpumalanga and the northern province , where there were severe floods recently .
he has to cut here and cut there , and a number of places in the southern cape have again suffered from floods , and we have had to spend money on that as well .
if we find that certain things are not correct , and that the hon member ms essop 's version is correct , we will deal with it .
in that regard the hon member mr king has made an important point , namely that if hon members clear the motions in advance , this could prevent confusion .
] i would request the hon member mr marais not to start playing with his yo-yo , which i think he intends doing right now .
the two main consequences flowing from these developments are firstly , the rise of knowledge as the key factor of production and , secondly , increased global competition .
their achievements have also been supported by national government 's motor industry development programme , which is very important also for our province and really a success story .
on the other hand some state institutions , such as the rail commuter corporation , have already made considerable progress in outsourcing their property portfolio , with very good results .
the first aim of the province 's property portfolio is to perform provincial government functions such as schools , hospitals , nature conservation , agricultural training , office space for our staff and road reserves .
the current board was constituted in may 1999 and our new chief executive officer , dr mike fabricius , took up office on 1 april 1999 .
it also contains the names of the regional tourism organisations , local tourism bureaux and so on , and even training and educational institutions which provide training on tourism .
the hon minister of finance and development planning will shortly bring draft legislation to sanction the province 's contribution to the construction of the centre .
it would seem to me that we have to benchmark this in order to measure our progress as we battle with the pandemic .
i also want to link up and associate myself with what the hon member mr louis has said , namely that generation of revenue is very important for us .
it is not mentioned and , in keeping with the vision document on the knowledge economy - where it is mentioned - it is simply an add-on .
the cmc and the new np have supported wesgro consistently , but the contribution of this province amounts to under half of wesgro 's budget .
annie is frightened for her children and wants to know why a tavern like this could be given permission to operate within a residential area .
should a wholesaler of liquor be involved in the selling of products to an illegal enterprise , that wholesaler will , in turn , lose his or her licence .
the second phase of development will create sectorial linkages between tourism and commerce as well as linkages between cape town and the rest of the province .
at this stage foreign investment in the western cape tourism sector may hardly exceed 10 % to 15 % of aggregate investment in this sector .
they said that the acknowledgement of local content and indigenous knowledge must be brought into the framework of developing the notion of knowledge societies .
i really believe that the hon minister should not drive a process in which his institutional restructuring means that the pdc dies a very untimely death .
the hon members ms essop and mr louis pointed out the extreme value of decision-makers being exposed to the trends in the international community .
the hon member mr gelderblom spoke about the red tape on the provincial side and referred to the red tape commission under the chairmanship of chris heunis .
currently , there is even a problem with police capacity , and the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation will be the first to admit it .
i want to say to him that a very large part of that green paper was prepared before she was appointed as a director of the province .
- definitely - that the white people in this province are against the rest of the inhabitants , and that is a message we are picking up everywhere .
importers make vast profits , employ very few people and spend no time in the fight against disease , labour unrest , farm thefts or abnormal weather conditions .
madam chairperson , i accept the health risk of smoking , in the same way that we are exposed to a variety of risks every day .
on that occasion he said that commercial agriculture was of the utmost importance for the south african economy , stability in the country and successful nation-building .
madam chairperson , the budget should aim to alleviate poverty , create jobs and provide seasonable services at a reasonable cost .
the irony is that it is his party and the individuals in the leadership corps of the dp who were responsible for land deprivation .
how many new owners in the towns will not be deprived of their houses by roofless people who buy them for next to nothing ?
as the hon minister of agriculture correctly pointed out earlier , how much of the tax on fuel does not go towards the maintenance of roads ?
when the farmers look around them - and i am referring specifically to the west coast region - time and again one hears the question : where do we go from here ?
the free market system works on demand and supply but over the past two years we have underproduced between 90 000 and 1 million tonnes of wheat .
if one multiplies that 57 000 by an average of 5 , one will see the enormous number of people who will suffer as a result of this .
this story today still represents reality out there , despite the budget address of the hon minister of agriculture and in spite of the budget .
add to that that in citrusdal today one still has a white and brown saps shift and the picture becomes even clearer .
are hon members aware that trade unions stole the " great " from great britain , and that the shipping industry collapsed as a result ?
my administration , in cooperation with the department of home affairs and the independent electoral commission , is involved in this year 's most important project - local election 2000 .
my address before the assembly of european regions in lyon , france has resulted in the 26 member states giving the western cape government special guest status .
the horrifying account of frail , incapacitated old people being subjected to verbal and serious physical abuse has sickened me to the core .
mr speaker , i welcome president mbeki 's reference in his address on friday to his government 's commitment to step up the fight against crime .
we will endeavour to transform them into assets of society and mould them into strong role models that others can follow .
mr speaker , from 15 january to 23 january 2000 we had 365 fires in the province , of which 207 were in the metropole .
mr speaker , we should be proud in our diversity , but there is still the awful reality that there are racial divisions , even colour-line politics .
we are part of a western world with a free market economy , and every body must be allowed to conduct its own business according to this principle .
accordingly it is not only the other suppliers and other modes that are being targeted , but more the community at which these criminal actions are being aimed .
therefore , mr speaker , i really believe that this is not only a codeta vs golden arrow issue , but it is much broader than that .
we wish to reiterate our stance that such interim legislation would have been unnecessary if the transport legislation arising from the white paper on provincial transport had been in place .
the new transport legislation for the western cape is vitally needed and has confirmed a lack of comprehensive response , and the lame excuses are totally unacceptable .
lastly , i call upon the taxi industry to go back to the negotiations and solve their problems in an acceptable way .
the real issue is that we should try to stop golden arrow from objecting to people applying for permits .
these powers did not exist before , and he will remember that section 2 of the principal act did not give him such powers .
why are we prepared to kill outside invaders with the most devastating weapons but not marauding gangs within our own borders ?
i say this because in 1972 i was the leader of a vigilante movement , one of the first in the western cape , of about 65 men .
if democracy is government for the people by the people , then why are the people dying daily like flies while government stand by helpless and idle ?
i personally think that whoever has murdered in the past as brutally as they did should never have qualified for amnesty .
what disappointed me , however , was that the subject for discussion which the hon member placed on the order paper reads , and i quote :
violent crime on the cape flats and its effect on especially women and children , and possible measures to restore peace and stability , ...
mr speaker , in virtually every newspaper that one opens today there is some form of crime - murder and so on .
] they know exactly how many times i have received calls late at night with an appeal for help , and i , without bodyguards ...
the other provinces should tell us in public for a change whether they supported that request by the president and the iec .
his performance in the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling has been merely that of a hack and he has displayed this again here today .
i will thus not even engage in answering the hon member mr ismail 's accusations about what the anc called for .
we can get into technical arguments , but in summary there was an expenditure by the director-general of the province during the registration process and election campaign last year .
it actually prevented south africans from voting , because it made it exceedingly difficult for those without bar-coded identity documents to be eligible to vote .
] does it mean that the hon member mr silke is not going to speak in the meetings of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling ?
i am astonished that those people who are so concerned about the rights of employees do not wish to support the right to remuneration of the officials of the western cape !
mr speaker , i want to ask the hon member mr ozinsky whether he thinks that they won the majority of votes in the western cape .
the point is that they were unhappy with the outcome , and they were not satisfied that the officials and the hon premier had taken action .
" i say that because we do not believe that they received a true 42 % of the votes , and therein lies the problem .
it is the custom that hon members do not make themselves guilty of undignified behaviour such as reading the newspaper , thereby showing that they have contempt for the debate .
i understand that when the schedule is put in the committee stage , particularly when we are dealing with expenditure , we may ask detailed questions about the expenditure itself .
for example , housing and planning contributed r30 000 odd , and you are asking the ministers to reply as to how the money was spent .
if the hon member expects a factual , accountable answer , i have to say to the hon member i cannot give it to him .
madam chairperson , in order to respond to future questions relation to volunteers , the volunteers who comprised the top management received the remuneration as far as i know .
secondly , how many people were deployed , and to where , from the civil service in order to arrive at those figures under his vote and in general terms ?
madam chairperson , in the light of the amount of r3 795 , how many health officials volunteered or were paid during the period of registration ?
madam chairperson , on a point of order : that was a serious attack on the chair and that is not permissible in this house .
madam chairperson , on a point of order : i thought we were only asking questions , not making statements .
madam chairperson , let me make it clear that the department of education never has enough money to do what it has to do .
if the hon minister of education finds out that teachers were involved in the voter registration during the examination period , what steps will she take in that regard ?
if the hon minister had made an ill-informed decision and has now only received the details , we cannot be held responsible for that .
] i am really quite offended by the level of procedural questioning to the schedules and to the way these schedules are being conducted .
madam chairperson , the answer to that question is that i cannot tell the hon member which programme or subprogramme .
madam chairperson , i would like to ask this side of the house to accept your ruling and get the matter over with .
madam chairperson , if the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs had applied his mind to this he would have known from which programme this money came .
madam chairperson , if this was not over a weekend , and the teachers or principals were taken out of the classroom , i will condemn it .
] secondly , i would like to ask the hon minister of education - this is a serious point and none of this is frivolous ...
the hon minister has also only now become aware that the r1,6 million is to be reimbursed , not in november when this was passed .
we said that we were looking for the money , we obtained the money from the various subprogrammes and gave it to the election fund .
those women look to us to fulfil the pledge of equality , protection and empowerment held firm in our constitution .
otherwise the airport , the doorstep to our province for tourists , investors and business people , will be the introduction to them of our pathologies rather than our opportunities .
the anc will , over the next two days of this session try to go beyond the spin towards the detail .
last year , when newspapers tried to blame his government for lethargy in dealing with the taxi crisis , he said they should look at pretoria .
the only reason why mention will still be made in the da of the dp and the nnp is that the constitution requires it .
i would like to congratulate him for again being accorded the honour this year of being nominated as the best premier in south africa .
however , i agree with the hon leader of the opposition , the unemployment rate is still unacceptably high , but we must gradually begin to win that battle .
sir , i want to move on to an issue touched on by the hon leader of the opposition which in many ways is our top priority this year .
linked with that is the second prong of the programme , which must be to deal from a security and policing point of view with the structure of the gang .
they have also shown , and the hon premier stated it again , that the government is a government for all the people of the western cape .
this banner is displayed against a background of a premier who since 1994 has been part of the government of the western cape , and in an extremely dominant capacity .
mr speaker , i must also point out that the initiatives launched recently after certain criminal activities along the n2 are welcomed .
we must also , through proactive action , try to establish the same kind of partnership for the other areas , particularly those areas where most crime occurs .
mr speaker , it is also the aspirations of farm workers that the hon premier intends to advance when he said in his opening address , and i quote :
i consider that in one way or another all of us who sit here fail to really serve in the spirit in which jesus served people .
mr speaker , in comparison to the empty election promises of the da , the anc has already begun to deliver on free basic services in beaufort west .
] if the anc says that we have forgotten our election promises , ask the people of crossroads what they think about the anc 's memory ...
] when people openly challenged him , he let them know that he was in charge and that their concerns counted for nothing .
we will be vigilant and make sure that the consistency is shown in their attitude towards the national government and the anc-controlled councils and administrations .
let me remind hon members that the anc received 42 % of the votes , the dp 11 % and the nnp 38 % .
it is the legacy of apartheid of the party that they were part of that divided the people of this province - the dp .
during the festive season , all the rich kids from around the country descend on the garden route with their allowances , and the drug market just booms .
this i also support wholeheartedly , and once again i refer to the southern cape , and specifically the garden route , or , as it is sometimes referred to , the garbage route .
i also wish to thank the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism for attending our celebrations and being part of the award ceremony .
her child , who should have gone into grade 9 , was not allowed back at school today because she had not been able to pay her school fees .
mr chairperson , on a point of order : will you take this opportunity as chairperson to adjourn the house now until tomorrow ?
no , sir , the voters of south africa were liberated ; they made their choice on 5 december 2000 - because they can think for themselves .
he also said that this province would ask the unicity , together with the other provinces , to speed up the process of preventing mother-to-child infection .
mr speaker , i have had quite a roller-coaster parliamentary career up to now ; such are the vagaries of public life .
it has been proved throughout the world that countries that address poverty in rural areas make more impact on the national welfare than countries that focus on urban poverty .
this theme which the provincial government will tackle this year is the implementation of our tenth intended objective - to focus on sustainable rural development .
mr speaker , i want to thank the hon members mr a j williams and ms rossouw sincerely for their positive speeches in regard to farm workers .
finally , sir , once again i want to refer the house to the anc campaign against agriculturists , particularly those in the southern cape .
the reality experienced by the majority of the people in this province differs vastly from the perception which the hon premier seeks to create .
they also seemed to wish to refer in the report to both the second reading principles and the committee stage details .
perhaps it is going to die at some point because it has been rolled over so many times and it has been transferred from one vote to another .
as has been said , there is no plan for the use of this money and we are continually being asked to approve the roll-over .
mr speaker , we should also question why the southern cape was singled out , because farm workers on the west coast and in the boland were retrenched .
our problem is not with the use of cameras ; our problem is with how areas are prioritised for the installation of cameras .
i would like to ask the hon minister of community safety what the people of manenberg , hanover park , kewtown , blue downs and murder city in riversdale must ask .
mr speaker , why i have a problem and am asking a question about this is the fact that it therefore entertains the possibility of bad faith .
] what were the kmos for both amounts allocated , the one to leeu-gamka and the allocation that is going to the southern cape ?
my understanding is that a total of r13 million was spent , of which this province contributed r5,4 million over a two-year period .
if they were incorrect , it means that there was simply a correction to put things right in regard to service agreements , persal arrangements and so on .
there are other cases , not only here but more in other provinces , which are going to have extreme financial consequences for the government of south africa .
i feel it is important from an integrated point of view for planning and the environment that the department of planning , governmental affairs and housing has an input .
indeed , the communities of these affected areas stand foursquare behind the principle that law and order must be upheld and taxi operators must be tackled .
while i am speaking about the local road transportation board , mr speaker , let me say that there is also a problem with the make-up of this board .
mr speaker , what we as legislators need to do is to put before the house not only the problems , but the solutions .
asking people to run amok with t-shirts or having political parties in the transport dispute will not bring a solution .
i am not talking about those who are coming into the system right now , because they will use the conventional method of applying .
now , mr speaker , it is not the taxis versus the taxis , but the taxis versus the buses .
mr speaker , on friday i travelled on a bus from khayelitsha with a 7-year-old girl who had been walking since 06 : 00 from mandalay .
what i would ask the hon member ms phenduka is why she does not ask the same question of her colleagues in the national assembly .
] the national minister of safety and security said that people that shoot and kill police officers should be convicted of a treasonable offence .
mr speaker , how seriously will the taxi industry take someone who is so fundamentally unsure about whether he is going to act or not going to act ?
if the hon minister does not know what to do he must shut up and say things when he is ready to act .
but if the hon minister speaks every time he changes his mind he is in trouble ; he cannot be taken seriously .
how seriously is the hon minister taken when the taxi industry knows that he will apply one set of policing standards in khayelitsha and another in constantia ?
now we face the effects that were predicted when he told us , " i know how to do my job .
it took the dp a long while to mobilise and go in their kombi to khayelitsha to get onto the buses .
they are our people and any cynical remarks about us possibly being behind the brutalisation and terrorisation of our own constituency have to be rejected .
i am not going to react to all speeches by hon members but i do want to refer to what the hon leader of the opposition said .
however , what sunwest did was to include a so-called boutique convention centre on the preferred site at the foreshore as part of their bid .
the top-selling cities for incentive travel are long-haul destinations , with cannes , paris and barcelona in europe competing with new york , boston , dubai and hong kong .
cape town already has the distinct advantage of being the preferred south african tourism destination , and indeed the icc will bring the crown jewel home to us .
the purpose of the bill is to make provision for the capital share by the province in the convention centre company , convenco , which is a private company .
the cape town international convention centre will be built on vacant land between coen steytler avenue , the heerengracht and the foreshore freeway which is currently being used as a car park .
nationally we have an international conference centre in durban which has interlinking halls with a combined flat floor capacity of 7 000 m  to compete with .
today , with this legislation , the provincial administration is enabling the most crucial new phase of this key project , the erecting of a world-class convention centre for cape town .
sir , on behalf of the members of my party i appeal to the hon members of the opposition : let us take politics out of tourism .
we said so in the standing committee and we will do so again today - we support the convention centre and we have always supported it .
in the definitions clause the " province " is defined as the " government of the western province " , and includes its successors .
] the constitution does not even define us as a " government of the western province " , but whose signatures appear at the bottom of the document ?
we still do not have clarity , as the public finance management act does not deal with this new animal that we are creating here .
the hon member mr r williams on the one hand expressed his support of the bill , and on the other hand criticised it .
attention has been given to that in the design of the centre to make sure that it can also be a wonderful new facility for that community .
] yet , after we have dealt exhaustively with the issues here , we have the type of almost destructive behaviour which i have observed here from the anc side .
madam chairperson , the hon member ms essop did not do me the courtesy of supplying me with a copy of this beforehand .
in pursuit of the objectives set out in subsection ( 1 ) , convenco must apply affirmative action principles with regard to procurement and appointments .
in pursuit of the objectives set out in subsection ( 1 ) , convenco must apply affirmative action principles with regard to procurement and appointments .
we are working to have a successful convention centre which , in due course , we will extend and then we will need a contribution .
moreover , the shareholders ' agreement is defined in clause 1 ( 1 ) ( xiii ) as including " any ... variation thereof " .
the convenco agreement could therefore be redefined in the definitions clause as " and any variation thereof " , as they did with the shareholders ' agreement .
that amendment does not feature in the standing committee amendments to the bill [ b9a-2000 ] , and it is not a technical change .
in the original text the meaning is different , in this text the meaning is different and there is no official tabling of an amendment .
it is therefore exactly as you have read it , madam chairperson , but the first " shareholders " needs to be changed to " convenco " .
vote 11 - education ( auditor-general 's report [ pr85 / 1999 - page 2 , paragraph 2.2.1 ( a ) ] ) : unauthorised expenditure
vote 16 - transport and public works ( auditor-general 's report [ pr 87 / 1999 - page 12 , paragraph 3.10 ] ) : alleged fraud
report of the standing committee on economic development , on the cape town international convention centre bill [ b9-2000 ] , dated 15 june 2000 , as follows :
the western cape determination of types of municipalities bill [ b10-2000 ] refers to one of those components of transformation , namely the types of municipalities .
i wish to refer hon members to an important section of the national constitution , section 155 ( 5 ) , which stipulates that , and i quote :
i also refer hon members in particular to section 11 of the local government : municipal structures act , which provides , and i quote :
the second one is the plenary executive system , the third one the subcouncil participatory system and the fourth is the ward participatory system .
mr speaker , on a point of order : i have been informed that the chairperson of the standing committee will participate in the debate before me .
the hon member mr ramatlakane should check with the chief whip in the house and make sure at the table that the change has been effected .
mr speaker , the hon minister took the decision out of fear because the new np cannot go into the municipal election with confidence .
the hon minister knows for a fact that the latest survey results show that the new np have only 17 % of the vote at the moment .
it is a pity that the hon minister did that to the department so that the officials could not really say what they really believe .
the hon minister himself issued the proclamation in which he expressly states that this is one of the aspects on which the district transformation forums must advise him .
future successful local governments , in view of changed circumstances , will be assessed with reference to skilled , well-equipped council members and quality management by trained officials .
for those reasons the new np cannot and are not prepared to support the anc idea of an executive mayor with executive powers .
we on this side of the house have followed the debates surrounding the implementation of the unicity with much interest and some scepticism .
in these provinces such a candidate is likely to have vast powers that are simply not limited by suitable checks and balances .
what we need in our society is checks and balances that will ensure there is no total domination by one political party .
what is necessary now , after we have really come through a three-phase process of transformation of local government , is that we begin to build up local government .
] perhaps we should not discuss it now , but my time is spent by saron whereas , in fact , it is an internal fight among the anc .
neither will those who cry " reverse racism " at all attempts at transformation deflect us from transforming the judiciary .
the same two judges seriously criticised the anc-controlled portfolio committee on justice of the national assembly when they wanted to summons judges to explain their rulings .
if the anc does not understand that , then this country will be over the wall in terms of the perception of it in the outside world .
mr speaker , another question we must ask ourselves is whether all the judges that i have mentioned above are sticking to the law .
i may not have the answer , but i still ask the question : in their judgments , do they always stick to the law ?
[ as a parent and mother to this little girl , i shudder to think that an old man of 54 years raped this girl child .
mr speaker , in this country at the moment we have a blurring of the roles and , in my opinion , this shows a contempt for the judiciary .
that victim or that mother should have the right to complain about the attitudes which have informed that particular judge 's statement .
the hon premier will remember how he fought for prince george drive , and he could not get them to change their minds .
of course , this warning goes back to what we said when the coalition was formed , about giving disproportionate power to the dp .
however , if it is able to give hope , as the hon member mr mckenzie has said , the new np can make its biggest break with its past .
they are always saying that the dp and the new np cannot fuse as an opposition and that this cannot work .
however , two pronouncements that he made indicate intention , namely , " he can lie to them as he likes " , and , " he comes and tells lies " .
mr speaker , on a point of order : i have noticed that the hon minister of transport and works is not in the house .
the banks have elected themselves as gatekeepers to that fund , and it once again denies black business the opportunity , the foot in the door .
it is public knowledge that small black businesses have publicly stated that they are moving from cape town to gauteng because they are being badly treated .
despite the proliferation of smme desks within banking institutions , very little has been done to provide start-up capital , guarantees and bridging finance for smmes , in particular for blacks .
at present the small business sector contributes 37 % to the gdp in south africa , yet it remains an undervalued and marginalised force in a highly concentrated economy .
small business is the good news sector of the economy , and it is the only sector that has steadily increased its absorption of labour since 1991 .
mr speaker , economic delivery is suffering from an ill-thought through division of south africa into nine provinces , and an equally ill-thought through allocation of resources , roles and responsibilities .
he has personally provided r2 million from his own pocket for the building of what can be regarded as an ultra-modern panel-beating shop in athlone .
but in athlone the best that the bank can give him by way of a loan to complete the construction is r600 000 .
" if black businesses had the money for a class action in court , they would not go to the bank for a loan .
we have to keep on moving the banks to adjust their lending and access policies and so on in order to do that .
sir , the question is : how do we actually deal with that disadvantage and turn it into a fairly level playing-field so that people can be ...
special report of the auditor-general on the former management boards in rural areas ( transitional councils ) in the province of the western cape [ pr 24 / 2000 ] .
vote 7 - corporate services ( auditor-general 's report [ pr 124 / 1999 - page 2 , paragraph 3.1 ] ) : purchasing of reprographic equipment
( 2 ) 44 motions have been given notice of since the beginning of the year and have not been debated by the provincial parliament ;
that the national minister for agriculture and land affairs , when she visits the southern cape , conveys the answer of president mbeki to the people of the southern cape .
there is no one in the house that can say that the rating system used in the past was a just or equitable system .
madam speaker , the truth of the matter is that the national bill on rates gives the national minister of finance the right to cap increases .
of course we all acknowledge the fact that there have not been valuations in cape town - that is unacceptable - but rates for some people have virtually trebled .
i say to hon members that municipalities will have an even harder time of it if the policy of the anc is implemented in the western cape and in south africa .
i ask myself the following questions : do people murder simply for the sake of murder , or are there other deep-lying causes of such violence ?
that there be a definite match between chapter one and each department 's inputs and that the link be made clearer in terms of their key measurable objectives .
mr speaker , the proposed amendment of section 80 of law 4 of 1996 comprises the following , and i quote from the explanatory memorandum :
for this reason we request the amendment of several definitions in the law , of which the definition of " social gambling " is the most important .
mr speaker , i have pleasure in moving the second reading of the western cape ninth gambling and racing amendment bill .
the council decided not to follow procedure and agreed to deal with the issue according to a provisional approval of the site .
it is no wonder that the new np has lost almost every single by-election in that area - and hon members can check on that .
however , i am not like the madunas of this world , who talk too much and accuse people , which then costs the state r6,5 million .
this is hardly the type of conduct one would expect from a party that is allegedly trying to do a cover-up job .
i can assure the house that when i receive the report i will take the necessary action and consult with the multiparty task team .
i therefore assume that the secretary must have given the letter dated 10 august 2000 to them and they have not replied to it .
they confirmed the finding , based on the very narrowly defined companies act , that the hon minister does not have a conflict of interest .
there was one , but because the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism was not there at the time , he could not participate in it .
every single operator of a tourism establishment , be it an operator , a transport operator , or a restaurant , in this entire province - in this entire province ...
i also want to say that the issue is that we as the western cape government need to make sure that that convention centre is one that is completely above reproach .
- the hon member ms essop may say , " shame " - and i want them to understand why i am here .
i mention it because the pity of it all is that the other side of the house simply does not understand what cooperative governance is .
i raise this issue because since i took office in october 1998 i have adopted a policy of cooperating with the opposition .
firstly - and although it has been dealt with before i would like to deal with it here - i would like to refer to the accusation regarding the companies act .
that is what we decided to do because of what they brought up in order to be a spoiler as far as the convention centre is concerned .
however , if it is pagad , does the hon minister not think that it is time that the national government brought them to the conference table ?
should we merely sit back with arms folded , hope for the best and hope that our names will not appear on the casualty list ?
are those areas , as the hon member mr n m isaacs mentioned , guarded constantly from the time that they are declared clean until the proceedings are concluded ?
what is more , if the national government possesses sufficient evidence of pagad 's role in the terror , why are the suspects not arrested ?
in this way , with the limited powers that he has , he may play a facilitating role in defusing violence in the province .
at the same time the anc must also accept some of the blame , because i was there when we offered them three posts in the cabinet .
sir , the whole debate on racism and discrimination , and accordingly the implementation of affirmative action too , will be with us for several generations yet .
the western cape government must admit and take the blame for the fact that they have totally failed to allocate job opportunities in the pawc on an equitable and representative basis .
we have noted how the current focus on race has unfolded since it was first announced by president mbeki in january .
what is the discourse , driven particularly by the dp component of the da , that is so virulently trying to deny a debate on racism ?
this discourse effectively avoids a debate and says not only that they do not want to debate it , but that a debate is illegitimate .
] how are the hon member mr byneveldt and his party going to dispute that in terms of their definition i am a black member of the cabinet ?
in pursuit of his party 's favour , has done nothing more than harm the very policies that he is trying to promote .
until the colour of a man 's skin is of no more consequence than the colour of his eyes , there will be war .
the hon member mr byneveldt , who moved the motion , took us to the land of canaan with very theatrical gestures and intonations .
] he soon realised that one cannot put just anyone on a motor cycle ; one has to teach them to ride a motor cycle .
( d ) the effect of the casino , which will inevitably give rise to more social illnesses , unless the provincial government implements a socio-economic monitoring mechanism .
- r4,5 million for hiv / aids for the implementation of life skills programmes as a preventative measure and for the establishment of voluntary counselling and testing facilities ;
on three occasions it was necessary for me to exercise these powers to address the following expenditure totalling r74 million :
- r28,1 million was allocated to vote 10 - economic affairs , agriculture and tourism on 9 september 2000 to repair flood damage in the gamka river area .
sir , this is why the anc wants people to lay civil claims against the farmers who are guilty of that .
mr speaker , the relationship between farm worker and employer is a unique one ; a relationship which has developed out of shared hardship in difficult economic times .
mr speaker , on a point of order : is it parliamentary for a member to call a fellow-member a " man barbie doll " ?
what is disappointing , however , is the way in which the dp and the new np , or as they are known , the desperate alliance , have behaved .
since the extension of security of tenure act , act 62 of 1997 was put in place , the workers have to pay rental , ...
the hon member ms rossouw serves in the da and they say that they are prepared to take action against people who mistreat their farm workers .
ek het een man wat hom as ' n lp van die wes-kaapse parlement voorgestel het , wie se naam ek nie nou kan onthou nie , ingenooi .
in the second place , mr speaker , i wish to point out to the house that a person is innocent until the court has found him guilty .
in the cor laubser case the charges of murder and abduction were withdrawn and the charge of assault has been referred to the director of public prosecutions .
report of the standing committee on economic development on the tourism amendment bill [ b 50b-99 ] ( ncop ) , dated 19 september 2000 , as follows :
( c ) not all income which had to be deposited in the prescribed housing operating account of various municipalities since 1 april 1998 was received ;
( d ) the financial position and the results of the housing operating account are not fairly reflected in the financial statements of municipalities ; and
clause 3 ( 2 ) must be deleted as this binds the mec into a process , which may be contrary to accepted labour relations practices in south africa .
( xvi ) portfolio committee amendment to african renaissance and international co-operation fund bill [ b65a-2000 ] .
i am talking about when a member keeps getting up and asking four questions , and when he has risen three times , he has asked 12 questions .
mr speaker , the hon minister in the office of the premier could only speculate as to which programme the money could possibly have been saved from .
the hon member mr strachan is not prepared to take a question and we cannot force him to do so .
] if the anc engages in " bulldozing " in the ncop and in the national assembly , then that is " the will of the people " .
this undertaking was given further impetus by the hon premier 's announcement of the 100-day projects , of which , of course , the house is fully aware .
everyone knows that in manenberg pupils have to duck and dive to make sure that they save their lives in order to secure their future .
he should go to eerste river and to the kraaifontein hospital , where the old people who are suffering from diabetes and high blood pressure have to stand in long queues .
we in the acdp have no doubt that the greatest challenge of this government is to unite the province in a real way .
the hon premier says that our role as government is to be responsible and that we must fulfil the requirements of the constitution .
" i asked him why he did not want to greet me and he said , " because you approved a development in goodwood .
the western province cricket club , and they must be congratulated , signed an agreement with a football club to make sure that they can use those resources .
let us look at the article on the front page of business day of 8 february 2001 - " british companies unsettled about south africa " .
when the hon member 's government , his president and the " handlanger " of the president , mr essop pahad , start criticising ...
he goes on to draw certain conclusions , namely that this means the end of the anc , not just in the western cape , but in south africa .
on the other hand the anc , which was regarded as the saviour of the people in the post-apartheid era , has proved that its role is obsolete .
as confirmation of what i have just said , i refer to an article by kaizer nyatsumba in the cape argus of wednesday 31 january 2001 , and i quote :
i know that the hon minister of community safety , who is not here now , does not believe that poverty has anything to do with crime .
mr speaker , we have recently experienced an upturn in business opportunities , which must stimulate us to create further growth and jobs .
that is one of the most important priorities set by the hon premier , and one that we all share , including the hon leader of the opposition .
as hon members are aware , the sport and recreation budget remains one of the most severely underfunded mandates in the province and in the country .
coloured people in the area have rightly pointed out that for the white residents the noise of 50 000 screaming rugby supporters is fine .
however , the cheering of 25 000 mainly township soccer fans disturbs their sunday afternoon sleep , and they expect us not to call that racism .
it is not interesting and complex because of the tone the hon premier and the da hon members in the house have set .
] the west coast therefore indicates clearly , for the information of the hon member ms rossouw , that the anc is ahead and the da is behind .
mr speaker , i want to conclude by saying that we as the anc believe that agriculture can and should be a high employment sector .
one objective is the creation of a safer environment for the people - we cannot stand up here and say nothing has been done .
but the hon member is now trying to wash his hands . he is trying to excuse himself by saying that he had no part in apartheid .
he wanted to fetch the chairs that the members of the party themselves had bought with funds they had collected by holding curry evenings .
of course , party discipline was strong and they were ordered to let it be , and so nothing could be done about the situation .
] they know their mayor took the mayoral car to worcester to buy at a specific shop using the mayoral fund .
the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism gave some excellent advice to that side of the house and also to their national leader .
i am afraid that i am going to have to disappoint the hon leader of the opposition ; retirement , either voluntary or enforced , is simply not on the cards .
the fact that an investigation has been ordered into the work of karin reed on the basis of a racist complaint will be added to her file .
the anc will ensure that the contents of the hon minister 's letter , with an accompanying memorandum , goes to all muslim organisations in this country .
in rom 13 it is put so well , " tribute to whom tribute is due ; but if you do what is evil , be afraid " .
mr speaker , likewise i would say to the hon premier that there are some things that we cannot be so proud about .
we must do everything in our power to empower the church and the family to give our aged the care that they deserve .
the acdp believes that we urgently need a government that understands that we cannot rebuild and reconstruct from a position of chaos .
his talents are demonstrated in bars and in the street - fist-fighting and drunken driving are some of the points in circulation from his curriculum vitae .
the anc , under the leadership of the hon leader of the opposition , has moved piously onto the high ground , as if its hands were absolutely clean of racism .
mr speaker , we must praise the hon premier for his vision of promoting the registration process for the municipal elections with provincial funds .
his initiatives in the field of tourism and the establishment of a knowledge economy in the western cape is going to produce many jobs for our beautiful province in future .
my administration , in cooperation with the department of home affairs and the independent electoral commission , is involved in this year 's most important project - local election 2000 .
yesterday in the debate i asked the hon premier whether the iec had requested such assistance and he did not answer the question .
mr speaker , when we look at the actual campaign that the government is preparing to run , there are very serious problems .
if the iec , as an independent body , does not reject what the western cape did , who is that hon member to say something about it ?
mr speaker , it surprised me that on tuesday last week students were taken out of their classrooms to form a guard of honour for the hon premier .
why are people invited to build homes in that municipality , more than any other municipality in the cape metropolitan area ?
we were born in poor areas and we are the champions when it comes to knowing what poverty is - not the hon minister .
while the hon premier mentioned crime in general , there is one aspect that he tends to overlook , namely crime against women .
the hon minister should reach out to all the communities and all the disabled people in the western cape wherever they find themselves .
mr speaker , i am not speaking about myself ; i am speaking about the people out there who need the assistance of the provincial government .
we cannot allow a situation in which people live or exist without basic rights or the provision of things such as water , electricity , housing , sanitation and education .
the hon premier referred to " walk the talk " in respect of fighting crime , peace and reconciliation and the african renaissance training academy .
after all , it is not the ministers and the affluent invited onto hiv / aids trains who must be educated .
it appears that none of those soldiers were eligible for a pension , even after 12 years or more of service .
they were right when they said in their meeting the other day that they had underestimated the anc and as a result they all had egg on their faces .
] that is why they fear a secret ballot because they know they cannot trust many of their own members .
] i want to state that i have already raised the fact that there is a misinterpretation from that side of the house regarding this matter .
our province is the saving grace for these poor people , a glimmer of hope in this " a better life for all " country of ours .
the dp is one hundred percent committed to eradicating racism in this country , as i am sure are most of the citizens .
the diversity of the region 's topography , with a mixture of mountains and rivers and sea , makes for one of the world 's most attractive tourism areas .
in cape town , only 20 % of whites are threatened in their neighbourhoods at night , while the figure is 50 % for black and coloured capetonians .
i also congratulate all hon cabinet ministers on their dedication , and the hon member mr marais on the role he played in this regard .
if we want to keep this value system in place , it would also be desirable for our churches of the various faiths to become more constructively involved .
they see the suffering of the people in lawaaikamp , d ' almeida , dysselsdorp , haarlem and kwanonqaba - they know about these issues .
mr speaker , today i not only want to respond to the hon premier 's opening address , but also to address the real issues .
six years down the line they want us to forget that farm workers - who incidentally are often coloured and black - actually have no rights !
for that reason our memories should never fail us - it is not about us ; it is about our children .
i want no white child to grow up after this time and feel that he or she is part of the herrenvolk .
mr speaker , again in contrast , let us look at just one example of how the anc serves the poorest of the poor .
she was referring to membership of a political party and the fact if that was correct , the hon member mr ozinsky would condone anything .
we therefore say that no addresses and no photos should be given to the province so that they can do what they want with them .
i would like to relate some comments made by ms naledi pandor , who happens to be the chairperson of the national council of provinces .
that is in complete contradiction to other hon members of the anc who said that they thought the major priorities were other things .
this continues , in spite of concerted efforts by the national government to fight racism , and the commitment to building a non-racial society .
mr speaker , during the opening address of the hon premier on 8 february this year , he presented a glossy picture of the province , in particular of education .
unfortunately , the 1998-99 prevalence statistics and the 1999 antenatal survey findings are not yet available because of problems , specifically in one province .
these shocking figures are a stinging indictment on this government 's fight against crime - a fight which it appears to be losing left , right and centre .
if this is a failure to secure all , including the poor , then the anc is surely to blame for this non-delivery .
besides a serious financial drought , agriculture in the western cape is struggling as a result of hail , heat and fire damage caused over recent months .
i would suggest that we get all the role-players together and hold a summit on housing and the working conditions of employees on farms ...
does this mean that the financial crisis of the new np will result in public funds being appropriated for the party-political agenda of the coalition ?
when this parliament opened , the people of mamre and atlantis came here and said , " make that beach in atlantis free for all .
the hon premier 's opening address was equally aimed at projecting a healthy and smoothly working coalition , but the facts are becoming clear .
they have four ministers , which gives them 60 % of the cabinet vote , but hardly anything in terms of the elections , only 4 % .
the basis of this fiscal policy framework is vested in the nine strategic policy goals for the western cape government , as approved by cabinet in july 1999 .
these educational trends have ensured that the western cape has a relatively higher percentage of people with post-school qualifications and technical skills than the rest of south africa .
additional own revenue is projected in the department of economic affairs , agriculture and tourism of r43,4 million , r54,4 million and r54,9 million , over the mtef period .
mr speaker , a number of provincial departments have instituted cost control and measures to ensure spending efficiency in order to promote effective use of public funds .
i would like to thank the chairperson and members of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling in anticipation of their favourable deliberations regarding the budget .
for purposes of rule 168 ( 2 ) i determine today as the date for commencement for consideration by the said standing committee .
the deliberations were intended to last for 1 815 minutes , compared to the average 1 660 minutes of the previous years when two more days were allocated .
the committee recommends that all departments monitor the application of affirmative action and the provisions of the employment equity act on a regular basis .
mr speaker , they created that situation and that situation was worsened by the np bantustan policy that further marginalised the transkei and the ciskei areas .
] what has happened in the last week is an acknowledgement from the government that it is not entitled to run a voter registration programme .
the national procurement policy preferential framework bill is a very good example of this , and only then it reluctantly and haltingly simply falls into line .
to pay 1c in every r100 or r10 in every r10 000 is not an extra tax as there will be a saving .
i would like to quote from hansard : western cape , vol 2 , col 285 , 1 march 1999 with regard to the second reading debate of the budget of that year .
if they represent 42 % of the electorate , as they keep saying on that side of the house , they should participate in the budgetary process .
i would , however , be failing in my duty if i did not deal with one particular issue and that is the issue of the r10 million for poverty relief .
the alternative is to look at lists of matters on which we can raise revenue ourselves which the minister at national level wishes to come up with .
we are the only provincial government to have placed our plans on a table for public scrutiny when we took the cabinet to pacaltsdorp .
these plans were underpinned by the budget tabled in the house last week by the hon minister of finance and development planning .
i referred to these initiatives in my opening address , much to the chagrin of the hon leader of the opposition who would have loved to have been able to relate some gullivers travels of his own .
this brings me to think of another emphasis one could place on standards and poor , considering their latest report .
this higher rating , which is equal to one notch , in effect , qualifies south africa for a place in the sunshine of potential new investment capital from international fund managers .
but to stir up old hatreds and heighten intergroup differences in our province will not contribute in any way to address the problem .
i would like that hon member to show me how many successful case studies there are , in other words , where poverty has been eradicated on a large scale .
very near us in voortrekker road - parow , bellville , vasco and goodwood - we have girls as young as 8 years of age , prostituting at night .
the women in guguletu , khayelitsha , elsies river and bishop lavis still do not know how to access the domestic violence act .
madam chairperson , as long as men still see gender as a woman 's issue , the problem that women experience in police stations , clinics and courts will continue .
from other departments , except from the department of health and welfare , the impression is one of some to no regular planned strategy .
the convictions that followed concerned one official being found guilty and sanctioned to dismissal and disciplinary hearings scheduled in respect of eight officials .
four cases will be heard in court , one case is still under investigation and the convicted person is currently serving a three-year prison sentence .
we have heard evidence that we have only 12 legal drafters currently in our employ , with about six senior officials doing most of the work .
] there is a need to develop their potential to the full so that we can have a better society , because they are the future leaders .
the hon minister in the office of the premier said in the house today that she was appointed during 1998 to deal with youth affairs .
what i shall try to do in the five minutes allotted to me is to spend one minute on each of the offices .
we look forward to having an integrated youth policy and we need to see the department launching various training initiatives , such as junior leadership programmes and management training .
in the course of the budget debate today , i realised , madam chairperson , that even the staff , or management , still have a problem around gender issues .
i am raising this because , if the hon minister does not have a business plan and does not have a policy , how is she going to spend the money ?
i want to mention to the hon minister , or propose to her , that we need to establish the departmental approach which i have raised with her .
we should simply pull these people together and let them help us devise the plan - which to me seems quite easy .
it is a pity that she , together with the other women in this parliament , suffer from the phd syndrome - the " pull her down " syndrome .
what is astounding is that this is only three million less than the number of orphans that died in europe before and after the world war .
( 1 ) in the afrikaans text , on page 43 , in line 35 , to omit " [ -en omgewings ] " and to substitute " -en omgewings " .
( 2 ) in the afrikaans text , on page 43 , in line 36 , to omit " [ -en omgewings ] " and to substitute " -en omgewings " .
the committee recommends that all departments monitor the application of affirmative action and the provisions of the employment equity act on a regular basis .
the committee noted the contents of budget statements 1 , 2 and 3 and wishes to congratulate the department on the new format of the budget documents .
what it amounts to is that internal arrangements are separated from the rules committee , so that the rules committee deals with rules and procedure only .
matters have already improve drastically , but the rules committee has decided that we will soon carry out a final evaluation and act in accordance with results .
i also immediately wish to thank the hon minister of finance and development planning and dr stegmann for the course that they presented for us this morning .
my colleague the hon member mr lewis has referred to it , and that is the allocation of funds to political parties for the chairpersons of committees .
madam chairperson , the hon member mr king also made a very good case here for looking after our buildings and facilities .
we can assure the hon member mr louis that we will continue delivering new information to the chairpersons as the need arises .
many of the matters he referred to will not be on that budget , but on the administrative budget of more than r1 million .
perhaps in this letter the hon minister 's office forgot about his other capacity , the other half of him that was attending the meeting .
the understanding of both the sa national parks and cape nature conservation was that this was an official government meeting and not a dp political meeting .
a committee has been set up by officials in the administration , but that committee is chaired by the hon minister of local government !
( b ) ( i ) and ( ii ) i shall lay the list of names of these persons , with the posts they hold , on the table .
mr speaker , i would never refer to the hon member as " girlie " ; i certainly would refer to her as a lady .
the final approval rests with the minister responsible for cultural affairs in terms of section 2 of the western cape cultural commission and cultural councils act .
( 5 ) the table bay homemaking club is a project which was managed by cultural officers of the directorate : cultural affairs and which has since been terminated .
the purpose of the projects was to train women and thus ensure that skills were transferred to support economic empowerment of women from previously disadvantaged communities .
( 1 ) what progress has been made with regard to the investigation into the circumstances surrounding the granting of the health information system tender ;
mr speaker , i will repeat the answer to subsections ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) in english for the hon member mr ramatlakane :
the hon member should only address such a request , because the time for replying to questions for oral and written reply are not always exactly the same .
i instructed the hon minister in the office of the premier to attend that meeting to sort out the problems .
mr speaker , the hon minister persists in complaining that there are not enough policemen and women and that he lacks the powers .
i am confused because an agreement was made and it was published in the press - that was all done in march and april 2000 .
my question is again : what is the role of the department of local government in monitoring illegal steps that are taken by councils ?
( 4 ) whether members of the provincial parliament are known to the security guards ; if not , why not ; if so , what are the relevant details ?
the protection services maintain the policy not to request identification from members of parliament , except when in doubt .
mr speaker , i do not want to stick my neck out and say the security officers are fully equipped to guarantee the safety of commuters .
we have begun to build bridges with korea , whose economy is growing by 10 % to 12 % per annum , but only after the asiatic crisis .
i have just told the hon member that our forensic audit department is looking into the complaint that was made .
this just shows again the type of attitude that the new np and the dp , or rather the da , take towards farm residents in the western cape [ interjections .
i am glad to hear that agri western cape is currently in the process of developing a code of ethics for all role-players in agriculture .
against this background , the cabinet decided to appoint the task team so that the inequality with regards to managers could be corrected .
these security actions took place in close cooperation with and with the support of the national and provincial police commissioners and the national minister of safety and security .
there were also those taxis who operated in defiance of the permit withdrawals and the impounding of vehicles of the illegal operators .
i met and worked with a broad range of fellow-south africans of exceptional quality which reinforced my perception that we are a truly blessed country .
mr speaker , i want to know whether finances or savings were among the reasons for deciding to close some of the schools .
mr speaker , i would like to put a follow-up question to the reply given by the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works .
last week i obtained a legal opinion to the effect that the two current sets of regulations , which have , in fact , been approved by the standing committee , contain certain unconstitutional elements .
the act was taken through parliament very quickly , as hon members all know , and a modicum of mopping up is required in respect of that act .
we have to determine whether we can give the regulations to the local authorities merely as a guideline , and hope that the local authorities accept them as part of their own arrangements .
whether he is aware of any discrimination against black workers at elsenburg ; if so , what steps have been taken to address the problem ?
mr speaker , as normal , i would not take the word of the anc for it , i would go and investigate for myself .
( b ) the state will not , however , suffer any loss , as arrangements have already been made to retrieve the amount of r42 317,43 .
mr speaker , could the leader of the house indicate whether the amount that was then overpaid has of today been repaid .
if the hon member ms essop has any information regarding this matter , i would ask her to let me have that information .
mr speaker , i may just say that the contract was renewed in terms of an option in terms of the original contract for a further year .
i asked how the saps , the sandf or any other special unit was involved in this regard and what the attached costs were .
mr speaker , the hon member mr ramatlakane is aware that the only transport company to which the western cape government pays subsidies is the golden arrow bus services .
will the hon minister show leadership by ensuring that the existing loopholes , which i raised during last year and this year , will be addressed ?
the pending preferential procurement policy framework act , 2000 ( act 5 of 2000 ) was delayed by national government and eventually promulgated on 3 february 2000 .
up to today this resolution has excluded a number of key sectors , leaving a large cross-section of black businesses out of the loop of the preferential procurement system .
the hon minister cannot blame the central government for the delay from 1997 to 1998 , which occurred in the provincial cabinet itself .
i am very pleased to hear that coming from the hon leader of the opposition because , simply , that is what i am waiting for .
( 2 ) whether r360 million is sufficient to build a world-class convention centre ; if not , what steps will be taken to raise more capital ?
( 1 ) yes , there was a shortage of certain medicines at the guguletu community health centre between 24 july and 11 august 2000 due to staff shortages .
in the past , persal was not specially designed to accommodate the definition ( which was only issued in december 1999 ) of disability .
currently numerous transformation and / or development initiatives are undertaken by different line function departments , some of which are related to actions as contained in the draft provincial disability strategy .
these transformation / development initiatives span a wide variety of areas at different stages and focussing on different aspects from conceptualisation , policy formulation , programme planning and development to implementation .
( 4 ) how will the universally accepted precautions for safety management of accidents and injuries be monitored at schools regarding implementation and results thereof ?
firstly , it is not a point of order , because the hon premier is entitled to call this situation what he wants to .
it empowered the people of the province to have a say in the government of their choice on 5 december and even thereafter .
] the innuendo that the hon member mr ramatlakane is trying to express here is not fair because he personally knows the man we are talking about .
we are investigating the establishment of a single marketing agency for tourism in the province in cooperation with local government and the private sector .
however , neither our existing programme nor the roll-out to new areas announced last august must be jeopardised by the test-site programme .
he also alerted us to the big problem , namely that everyone always wants their programme or project first in the list of priorities .
one is an issue that has been alluded to before , the high proportion of spending on roll-over funds in this appropriation .
i do hope that the department of finance itself has now clarified the billing system that has led to this very high expenditure in this financial year .
thirdly , there is the shifting of funds between and within votes or to follow the transfer of functions in terms of section 42 .
a further r16,9 million to economic affairs , agriculture and tourism , the sources of which are projected to be increases in motor vehicle and liquor licence revenue and rent collection .
their internal report confirms that race is still a problem in the anc ; the race card that they have all played these last few days .
i said that if they would include members in other cabinets around the country and in the national cabinet , we would consider it here , ...
mr speaker , i do not know where the hon member mr winde gets the idea that capacity goes up to 90 megalitres a day in certain cases .
( 4 ) whether any assets have been disposed of thus far ; if so , ( a ) how many and ( b ) how much money was raised ;
mr speaker , if i understood the hon member correctly , he raised the question of criteria of empowerment in terms of the policy-writing .
however , we have not as yet had a discussion from a policy-based side , and it may be a feasible discussion to have .
( 2 ) whether the department intends taking any steps to protect the breeding grounds of the black oyster catcher or any other aspect of grotto bay beach ;
mr speaker , i will gladly do that and send the hon member mr louis a copy of the report when i get it .
members of the public must in my view have knowledge via prominent signage at all places of gambling of whom to contact in this regard .
madam chairperson , i would like to make it clear that the western cape will not stand on the sidelines and witness the break up of family values .
madam chairperson , to replace the existing cape hospital system , which is now 25 years old , a new hospital information system is in the process of being implemented .
the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism gave an emotional and hot-off-the-congress-press speech , a fight-back speech , which epitomised the dp 's lurch to the right .
through its veins flow the disbursements from national treasury , and its arteries lead to all the key services offered and supplied through our administration .
madam chairperson , at the outset i too would like to express my gratitude to the department of finance for the extremely responsible budget that they have tabled .
ongoing training in financial administration in respect of this law is already in progress in this province , for politicians and for staff at management , middle and lower levels .
when this matter was discussed in the standing committee they were of the opinion that these huge casinos should not be built next to working class areas .
] here , once again , he criticises the chairperson without any knowledge whatsoever of how many times he has gone to las vegas or anywhere else .
before i do that , i just want to remind hon members that the standing committee meetings on community safety and sport will take place after this debate , in the house as well .
the so-called bonanza of r1,1 billion , spread over two years , pales into insignificance in comparison to the overall annual budget of r14,5 billion .
with this in mind , the projected personnel shortage for the start of the year 2001 is calculated at a shocking 54,87 % below what it should be .
of course there are problem areas , but i have personally been very proud to be associated with them over the 18 months that i have been in this post .
as he always says to other good officers , i now say to him , " with you by my side , i shall go to war any time .
in no small way can the current peace from urban terror in this province be attributed to commissioner crafford and his operational team .
madam chairperson , as i stated earlier the two main pillars we will be concentrating on to achieve these objectives are specifically training and coordination .
this project seeks to develop young adults as assets of society and to provide opportunities for them to be positive role models .
to this end the province has initiated two processes , firstly , the training of cpfs in the province in proper bookkeeping and efficient meeting procedures .
all major role-players participate in the forum and address issues like street children , vagrants and the coordination of millennium activities were also dealt with .
during 1999 eleven officers died fulfilling their duty ; 21 died natural deaths and 5 destroyed themselves .
the only aspect i felt he left out concerns the recent gangsterism we see in the form of pipe bombs and other things .
had it not been for special initiatives like operation good hope , hon members can just imagine what this province would have looked like .
madam chairperson , we support this vote , but we need serious and urgent action at the national level to kick-start any improvement .
nevertheless , as a member of the standing committee , i make an earnest appeal to communities to become more involved in neighbourhood watches and in police forums .
in contrast to the failed compulsory school attendance programme in the disadvantaged communities , it was implemented very successfully in the then cape education department and in other provincial education departments .
there is no doubt in our minds that the community police officers have rendered an excellent service in the western cape in helping us to bring down the crime level .
i know that the hon minister of education is trying very hard to involve parents , teachers and community structures in the prevention of vandalism at schools .
the department hosted successful summer and winter games in disadvantaged communities in the western cape , reaching nearly 12 000 participants during the june and december school holidays .
after a public participation process , a new board was appointed under dr liz bresson of the university of stellenbosch to manage wecsa 's affairs .
i personally attended one or two of them , such as a volleyball event in the khayelitsha new way centre , where we had over 600 participants .
it is my view that the wced should be doing more to include the subject , so as to ensure a healthier and more goal-directed learner population .
i wish to emphasise that it is as a result of their contributions that our sportsmen and women achieve success and that opportunities are created for the elite sports people .
sport stars like herschelle gibbs and others we are talking about need to be brought here so that they can send a message on hiv / aids to our children .
in conclusion , madam chairperson , i want to say that as long as there is no progress in terms of sport in this province , we shall raise racism .
i am aware that the community games , summer games and the winter games recreation project and safehaven project have attracted literally thousands of youngsters over weekends and during school holidays .
in particular i want to thank dr kane-berman for the role she has played in sport and wish her everything of the best wherever she may go .
we have already opened offices in the south western districts / oudtshoorn area and it is our intention to open further offices in the boland and west coast regions .
i note with interest that in his opening address to parliament on friday president mbeki also focused on a budget shift in this direction .
there are other examples : the highest literacy rate ; taps in more houses than anywhere else ; the most household telephones ; and the highest average per capita income .
the participation of the western cape in the world cup will not only enhance our status in the international sporting arena , but also attract many more foreign visitors .
the purpose of this project is to assist the approximately 1 million established people in the western cape province who have not yet been registered as voters .
persons in remote places in the rural areas will not have to travel far to register - officials of the department will go to them .
the western cape cannot afford to enter the new millennium in isolation from other strong regional economies .
it was also agreed that tourism would receive special attention , with the focus on capacity-building measures and fast-tracking the development of small and medium enterprises .
i also welcome the president 's undertaking to restructure and revamp the entire criminal justice system - something we have been calling for for a long time .
such systems require policing and serious attention will have to be devoted to extending the corps of traffic police of our province and making it more effective .
sir , the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation , the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs and i took part in the launch of operation fire stop .
that is why one of our policy objectives is to bind the province , as the gateway to africa , ever more strongly to the country and the continent .
mr speaker , i would like to assure hon members of the house and the assembled audience that i will not be detaining them for any length of time .
the available research shows that most students can learn most things if they have enough dedicated teaching and studying time to do so .
because we are committed to transforming the educational opportunities of the poor , we strive to achieve these basic conditions in all our schools .
our experience is that once the basics are in place , schools generate the momentum that propels them along the continuum of development with our support .
the real issue , prof bengu concluded , was poor management , which he said was a far more important factor than financial constraints .
the subsequent detailed report by an independent commission that investigated the situation at fort hare confirmed prof bengu 's analysis .
we are now developing mechanisms which i hope will enable us to test the impact of this redistribution on educational quality .
we welcome them , even though the subsidy to support their education is paid to the eastern cape government , which puts our system under greater and greater stress .
it was one of the major victims of the rationalisation process as a non-examination subject , and it bore the brunt of this process particularly in high schools .
we have found - and this is a very important finding of our research - that vandalism is often linked to unresolved conflicts within school communities themselves .
hon members can imagine what we could do for computer literacy in schools if we did not have to spend so much money on school safety .
the wced also allocated an amount of r100 000 to each of seven disadvantaged schools that had managed to improve their 1999 matric results significantly .
the wced has also completed the initial planning for a major new project known as the khanya project in collaboration with the western cape schools ' network and schoolnet sa .
we also have the sact team under the leadership of mr johan smit to train governing bodies to understand and execute their functions properly .
that means we do not have much leeway and there is not much room for innovation and creativity in our budget .
when all the bewildering information about these matters is considered , it will be appreciated that we have a major challenge on our hands to empower the youth to withstand these onslaughts .
i should like to ask the wced whether there is any difference between a high school and a secondary school , and a low school and a primary school .
the third point i wish to touch on is physical education as a compulsory school subject , something which the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation also referred to yesterday .
this means that reform must focus on the development and interrelationship of all the main components of the system simultaneously : curriculum , educator development , and community and student support .
educational change requires an alteration in the beliefs of individuals across the system in order to bring them on board regarding the new policy initiatives .
educational change involves a massive paradigm shift in the pedagogy and epistemology of educators , a majority of whom have been teaching for many , many years in our country .
when i presented to her here the letter that came from touws river primary school inviting only white parents , she understood it .
in their endeavours to provide world-class education in this province , they will need the full support of this parliament , parents , teachers and learners .
sir , the only transformation that has taken place in the province since 1994 has taken place as a result of the national legislation relating to transformation of education .
globalisation is one of the great topics in the world at the moment , and i think with that type of mission statement we can only go forward .
secondly , in the field of maths and science - the hon minister referred to it today - south africa is facing an enormous crisis .
building what might be termed a culture of science and technology requires that formal school and informal science experiences be provided for and nurtured .
every year we stand here and boast , quite rightly , about our matriculation results , because every scholar who has performed well has done so by dint of hard work and has earned it .
it is evident that feeding schemes at schools not falling into categories a , b or c will be terminated with effect from 1 april 2000 .
in some cases the school only starts at 09 : 30 , and i do not think that that is part of the plan of the hon minister .
madam chairperson , as far as vandalism at schools is concerned i can also just say that it is sad to encounter this kind of destructive urge among our people .
i was very concerned when i heard that they were using our data from the norms and standards for the funding of schools , for the feeding scheme .
i am not implying for a minute that the hon member is not an ordinary human being , but i will look at it very carefully .
indeed , may i be so bold as to say that physical circumstances have a lot to do with other factors , including management problems at schools .
i think i have addressed most of the issues raised by the hon member dr van zyl , particularly the flight to independent schools .
they are currently engaged in the upgrading of r241 million at the red cross hospital , which for the most part has been made possible by tremendous support from the private sector .
it is not acceptable to simply rely upon funds from the national department of health for the support of patients who are hiv positive .
are community-based services and facilities being improved to ensure that community health centres take responsibility for coordinating the services catering for the needs of people with disabilities ?
tb alone is the most frequently occurring notifiable disease and a complex public health problem which continues to deteriorate , as i indicated earlier .
nutrition intervention should promote and support the dignity and self-respect of recipients and acknowledge people 's own practices , knowledge and creativity as important forces for change .
yet this is where we train our future doctors , and the more minor trauma , the cases that the students should be learning from , is not permitted .
i know that the department has been working to develop this idea , i think over the past year , since the new hon minister took over .
madam chairperson , i would now like to read to the house a letter that was sent to the hon minister by dr hilton , and i quote :
on tuesday , 7 march 2000 , he became seriously ill and was taken to the elsies river day hospital for a possible referral to tygerberg hospital .
general report of the auditor-general on the accounts of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1998 [ pr 4 / 2000 ] .
regarding the structure of the head office , the investigation has been completed and the new structure will be implemented from 1 april 2000 .
once financed , the finance continues virtually ad infinitum , irrespective of performance , and a predetermined set of services , usually with a single purpose .
regarding the computerisation of the registry , the branch : social services is a service delivery organisation and needs to keep records of a vast volume of information on all beneficiaries .
at this point there are seven places of safety which have been established in terms of the child care act , 1983 ( act 74 of 1983 ) and criminal procedure legislation .
it seems as though we shall have to extend the period to five years with projects such as these so that we can provide the necessary support there as well .
if a beneficiary has missed a payment , the social grant will be available at any paypoint in the western cape until the end of the payout cycle .
the grants of 720 beneficiaries were cancelled of the atlantis district office , while the grants of 1 578 beneficiaries were cancelled in the area of the cape town district offices .
this , of course , is a major concern , because from 1 april 2001 there will be no more state maintenance grants given to parents and children .
taking into account the reduction in the allocation of funds from the national poverty relief fund , i should like to draw the attention of hon members to the following quotation :
it is still important that the consultant should be appointed since the desk does not currently have the capacity to carry out the above activities .
this office will also ensure access to education of all people living in poverty , in particular strengthening education and skills training at all levels .
i understand the pressures the department worked under with the changing of the ministers during a time when the budget had to be fine-tuned and tabled .
we need clear policy in place on home-based or community care service for people infected or affected by hiv / aids .
to the acting hon minister of social services and the acting hon minister of poverty relief , we wish them good health and godspeed in these very important portfolios .
the amount of r2,2 billion budgeted for health and welfare is a lot of money , but this vote is always seen as a type of maintenance budget .
as you said in your speech earlier , madam chairperson , we can do it in the departments of agriculture , of economic affairs and of education .
if the velocity of money was merely 20 times per year , this is a loss of r2 billion per annum to the economy of the western cape .
this department has shown that we can put in place a leadership that has earned the respect of all parties and people , of urban and rural communities .
many of those old-age homes - i am sure that the hon minister will be able to give us an update - have historically been white .
in the department we will soon have a discussion with the hon member as the chairperson of that specific group rather than as a member of the house .
the road will not be tarred before the little karoo arts festival - it will be done after that - but the road has indeed been officially opened .
beneficiaries must be aware that there are measures in place to deal with poverty , such as the equitable share which local governments can access .
private and public sector developers can negotiate with local governments who own the land in question for the right to develop the land and provide housing opportunities .
when i looked at the report and the core objectives and strategies of his department , i could see that the officials had really applied themselves .
district six has had a few owners , because most of the land was the property of the old progs who used to be cape town councillors .
mr chairperson , housing development in south africa and in this province continues to play a powerful unifying role , bringing disadvantaged people together under extremely difficult circumstances .
mr chairperson , a short while ago we had yet another fire in langa , which ravaged through many of these wooden , cardboard and plastic homes .
this should be the framework that guides us in whatever we do now , but the hon minister is far from achieving that .
it is a struggle for a society whose purpose is to meet the social needs of its people on a sustainable basis .
this means that it is a society not based on the profit motive or on the greed of a few to the disadvantage of the majority .
at a meeting on 17 february 2000 in amstelhof , the residents of amstelhof were furious and wanted to march on the offices of the local transitional council .
why does he not write a letter to mr justice chaskalson and ask him what the constitution means by " everyone is entitled to a dwelling " ?
this is why , in the first place , the minister at national level said , " the need for the social compact does not exist any more .
one had to get the homing pigeon society , the housewives ' club , the blind , the squint and the crippled to agree before one could start a project .
these include aspects such as halls , a crche , clinics , taxi ranks and sports facilities , but an explicit condition is that they may not be employed for schools .
i want to refer to the powers and duties of the municipalities , and specifically the split between category b municipalities , the local municipalities , and category c municipalities , the district municipalities .
at the last minmec meeting i was also appointed by minmec to serve on a ministerial committee that would look at the restructuring of electricity provision .
one of the points that we want to include in legislation , and that we have already included in the legislation regarding district transformation forums , concerns the appointment of staff .
we hope that they will take heed of this , but when i listen to the chairperson of salga , it seems as if he wants to press on with his centralisation process .
did oostenberg not buy a building for more than r1 million because white officials did not want to go into the coloured areas , where there were buildings ?
by way of interjections she has implied some doubt as to the integrity , objectivity and bona fides of the chairperson of the demarcation board , dr mike sutcliffe .
if we as a province are to be a relevant and credible sphere of government , we should object to this bypassing of our treasury by the national department .
] yes , because he is not here , and the dp are not here , but the hon ministers of the new np have to sit here .
hon members can today , in all sincerity , ask the cape town municipality , which was the last municipality to get it done , why they did it .
i invite hon members to have a good look at oostenberg and to see what is going on in the municipality of oostenberg and what is happening there .
i am now going to report progress to the speaker , but before i do so i want to make another point on participation by those in the gallery .
this team was made up of representatives of the local government sector , environmental ngos , cape nature conservation and relevant professional institutes such as the institute of town and regional planners and sapoa .
to assist in gathering this information , a consultant was appointed to investigate the migration of people to the western cape .
the task was performed under the auspices of the department and managed by a task team comprising provincial and national departments , organised agriculture , district councils , farm worker associations and unions .
before i do that , i want to comment on the issue of dassenberg and the decision that has been made by the hon minister in this regard .
this framework , having gone through a public participation process , and through consultation with all the local authorities in the metropole , was published in april 1996 .
the structure still stands and the planning department , after much legal battle , ended up changing the zoning so as to pass the building and make it legal .
unfortunately , as a minority party the acdp has only five minutes in which i may speak on a department that i would love to spend much more time on .
i cannot help but address the dassenberg issue , but perhaps i shall also have time to speak about other things .
when we look at the personnel corps in this particular department , we find , in fact , that in senior management , from assistant director upwards , we have zero representation of african people .
there is a distinction between business promotion , attracting investment and facilitating a process where communities , ordinary people , civil society , can participate in planning issues .
those organisations are going to be excluded from this process , if the pdc is going to be collapsed into the empire of the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism .
i want to ask the hon member mr ozinsky , from this side of the house , not to employ what i call gabru-istic principles .
the very fact that he makes such a statement indicates to the people outside , via the media , that someone is up to no good .
this money will be spent on creating posts to establish a core component in the department to advise on pollution and waste management .
this will bring about a peer review process within the industry , which is also intended to lift the quality of the assessment reports and the assessment thereof .
popular culture and youth cultural awareness and involvement will now be supported as an integral part of the broad definition of culture .
its express purpose is to promote multilingualism in the western cape and to ensure the correct development of previously marginalised indigenous languages of the western cape .
my ministry and department will ensure that the main beneficiaries of this renaissance will be the klopse themselves and that the festivals will remain authentically western cape .
with this budget we stand by our commitment to achieve our key measurable objectives , kmos , and demonstrate to the house how they will be achieved .
there are farmers in that area who have received more than r1 million in compensation from the cmc because the sewerage was pumped onto their land .
the councillors of the hermanus municipal council did not take this decision in a vacuum ; there was extreme pressure on them from the entire community .
i also want to make this a project for the western cape nature conservation board , so that they also play a role in respect of education regarding the environment .
i receive only cooperation from my cabinet colleagues and i want to thank the hon premier and my colleagues for all their support over the last few months .
i believe that we should get assistance from the ngos out there and from the general public , who can act as whistleblowers in this regard .
on two different occasions i was at the final round of the cape coons , and one year 20 000 people attended .
i have been passed a note by my department to remind me what popular culture means , however , and i shall read it to the house .
the western cape nature conservation board has been consulted and they approved these amendments at a meeting held on 28 october 1999 .
due to increased deterioration of provincial metropolitan and rural roads , it will be necessary to increase motor vehicle licences by - can any hon member guess ?
works is therefore to provide professional and technical services to client departments in regard to provincial buildings and related infrastructure .
i heard recently one person saying to another , " it is hard in the mills , my love , it is hard in the mills .
i also wish to thank mr jakkie van heerden and mr carel du preez , as head of the department , for what they have done and will be doing .
a study on transport has estimated that an integrated inner-city public transport system will allow for an additional 8 million car trips per annum by the year 2015 .
we heard today that there is a r700 million backlog and this year we have budgeted r93,4 million , with r16 million for specialised funding .
whether we use bridges or look at some attractive programmes , a policy should be put in place to see how we can generate extra revenue .
this means the process will still take a couple of months and toll-roads will only be implemented in about july or august .
it has received a lot of criticism , but we need to see full operational efficiency by the end of march , as well as the implementation of a complete filing system and registry .
they are now going to resume at the point where they stopped , where there is approximately 1 km of new road , and build on from there in the direction of robertson .
madam chairperson , the other issue of importance is that of smmes and this needs urgent attention as a means of addressing socio-economic objectives .
in the gallery there are taxi operators who are remaining seated , waiting patiently to hear that the problem of their transport permits has been addressed .
when we look at an aspect like roads where we have a backlog of r700 million we note that the deficit for this year is r369 million .
if this does not happen , the contractors will simply remain disadvantaged , and after the finalising of the contracts will have more debt than anything else .
the hon minister of transport and works has taken on a very difficult portfolio and none of us can deny that he is doing an excellent job .
i know the hon minister 's commitment to this - i do not doubt that - but i would have like to have heard more about it .
therefore , i also want him to find out which officials went to that school and told the community to remove the cisterns .
i therefore request hon members that when they are talking to their benchmates , they should remember that they are disturbing the person who has the floor .
i want to thank the hon member mr king for having made representations for 21 years - not just to me , but to other people too .
not along ago i had a question from the hon member mr strachan , to which i replied during question time , and in his absence .
that is r30 million that had never before been awarded to abes - 152 companies on the abe list have been awarded contracts .
the hon member mr ramatlakane also referred to the r10 million that the hon minister in the office of the premier will use for poverty alleviation .
i trust that as i said this morning , certain amendments are going to be effected to the bill and to the traffic management corporation act .
i also want to convey my special thanks to one of the road engineers , mr johan odell , who opened the r62 between calitzdorp and ladismith as quickly as possible .
when i think back to about six years ago , when the hon member ms essop was a whip , she made a very fiery speech one day .
i said to her , " colleague , you a brilliant politician , but take care ; there is enough scope for you .
] there are objections to the motion being moved without notice and therefore it will appear on the order paper for possible discussion at a later stage .

this has contributed greatly to holding my department , and certainly me , accountable for the job that we are supposed to be doing .
collaboration with , and gaining acceptance and legitimacy from civil society with respect to labour practices , environmental practices and the like are increasingly important to companies .
madam chairperson , firstly , there is very strong support , especially among the tourism industry players , for a single agency that will be responsible for tourism marketing in the province .
such an agency will encapsulate a partnership between the provincial government , the new unicity , district councils and the private sector in terms of which decision-making , strategy and funding .
there is also a mounting liquor lobby that sees the availability of liquor as a serious health threat that should be curtailed .
for example , since july 1999 , as a result of the rationalisation of office accommodation in the city bowl alone , the department has achieved savings of r900 000 per month .
with the opening up of eu markets and rapidly changing international demand patterns for agricultural produce , there is a need to fast-track key agri-business niches with employment and growth potential .
i would like to pause here and focus the attention of the house on the huge crisis that is looming in the deciduous fruit industry in the province .
at this stage private sector funders are being approached for funding , which will be matched by dti funding for the next three years .
i think it is the ireland trip that made me change a little , and i want to thank the hon minister for his proactive approach regarding that .
as for western cape air links , i know that the hon minister has been working hard on that issue , and on shipping and the utilisation of the cape town port .
as hon members will recall , five years ago , in the time of premier hernus kriel , we committed ourselves to a five-year programme regarding wesgro .
if , after three years , there are just two public / private partnerships going through , one cannot really face the public .
for three years we have been talking about a rental audit , and we hear the hon minister report today that it is still not complete .
when it comes to property , however , if one wants to sell one 's property , one does not always get an external property expert to value one 's property .
property value is determined solely by demand and supply , so a building is only worth as much as the rental one can get in for that building .
accordingly i appeal for a coordinated , uniform industrial programme between business promotion and local governments in the western cape , which will include not just the metropole , but also the rural areas .
the hon minister has talked about the threats to citrus farming ; we need a lot more detail and there needs to be an investigation and a policy framework for it .
madam chairperson , no amount of highfalutin legal and constitutional talk can hide the blame of the hon minister on the issues of the liquor bill .
i thought i would use this opportunity to enlighten the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism about those international debates .
many at that conference contested the notion that one can talk about a knowledge society and said that we should rather talk about knowledge societies .
it obviously denies nation states the ability to accrue revenue and deal with key developmental issues , as well as having a very serious impact on local businesses .
i believe that the hon minister should take the initiative and look at what is currently happening in terms of local authorities developing policies around it .
if we do not provide for their fundamental health care , they are not going to get the opportunities and have the health to grasp those opportunities .
i appeal to the national government to make state land available to the provinces so that emerging farmers can be settled as soon as possible .
agriculture has committed itself to .
madam chairperson , if we continue to set these impossible demands to our farmers , we shall lose the industry and its job opportunities as a whole .
firstly , the acdp would like to convey their sympathy to all the farmers that suffered loss during the floods and the fires we have experienced .
madam chairperson , at present the agricultural industry is having a very hard time of it and this will certainly have a negative impact on economic growth in the western cape .
ronald reagan once said that farmers were in an industry which made the gambling table in las vegas look like a guaranteed annual income .
in 1997 the producer obtained r1,42 per litre whereas now , after the increase which took effect on 1 march 2000 , the producer is getting r1,32 .
madam chairperson , currently the wheat price is the same as it was in 1996 but an increase of approximately 8 % in the fertiliser price is envisaged .
for that reason i say the time has come to ensure that our children cultivate a love of agriculture as soon as possible .
at the moment the farmers who export table grapes are getting r13 for a box of grapes in london , and the production cost is between r22 and r25 per box .
i shall lead my own delegation , but he is very welcome to accompany it and give the necessary support from the side of the anc .
madam chairperson , i would like to make a declaration of vote and put it on record that we have serious concerns with vote 7 , programme 3 , subprogramme 4 , dealing with poverty relief .
we note , of course , that it is just an account that has been kept over , but the intention is to have r10 million rolled over .
report of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling on the western cape direct charges bill [ b6-2000 ] , dated 22 march 2000 , as follows :
mr speaker , on a point of order : i just want to state that we did , in fact , try to negotiate the motion with the opposition .
i note with interest that in his opening address to parliament on friday president mbeki also focused on a budget shift in this direction .
there are other examples : the highest literacy rate ; taps in more houses than anywhere else ; the most household telephones ; and the highest average per capita income .
the participation of the western cape in the world cup will not only enhance our status in the international sporting arena , but also attract many more foreign visitors .
the purpose of this project is to assist the approximately 1 million established people in the western cape province who have not yet been registered as voters .
persons in remote places in the rural areas will not have to travel far to register - officials of the department will go to them .
the western cape cannot afford to enter the new millennium in isolation from other strong regional economies .
it was also agreed that tourism would receive special attention , with the focus on capacity-building measures and fast-tracking the development of small and medium enterprises .
i also welcome the president 's undertaking to restructure and revamp the entire criminal justice system - something we have been calling for for a long time .
such systems require policing and serious attention will have to be devoted to extending the corps of traffic police of our province and making it more effective .
sir , the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation , the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs and i took part in the launch of operation fire stop .
that is why one of our policy objectives is to bind the province , as the gateway to africa , ever more strongly to the country and the continent .
in the first instance i spoke to the hon member mr ramatlakane on the morning before the meeting of the standing committee and we agreed on certain points .
we did not see this bill in isolation and , more importantly , i do not think that this legislation is restricted only to the codeta-golden arrow issue .
as hon members know , in that area , for people to get from khayelitsha to town by taxi costs them approximately r10 per day .
we can see that the people are being affected financially because they are forced to use the taxis , and their constitutional rights are being affected .
clause 30a gives the minister the necessary powers to intervene in an unsafe area and to call for it to be a demarcated area .
most importantly , the provision to legalise the illegal operators under the special legalisation process has shown that the desired result was not achieved .
the anc remains firm that the path of negotiation is the only path to finding a lasting solution to problems of this nature .
] if they are in agreement with me , it is clear that they cannot say that golden arrow must not be allowed to go there .
he added that the golden arrow bus services transport 160 000 people daily , while the taxi companies do not transport half of that number of people .
some high-ranking civil servants and high-profile politicians are corrupt and are allowed to escape with a mere slap on the wrist from our own justice systems .
one of them is that a gang member is usually not the only family member in his / her family who has a sentiment about a particular gang .
prior to 1989 south africa was one of the few countries that did not sign the united nations declaration of children 's rights , which was drawn up in 1956 .
if political parties and the people who are involved in combating crime do not have the cooperation of the community there will never be a victory .
the country will then not have the mechanism to call up people because the members of the defence force are all deployed in the country .
he said , just like goebbels , that if one tells a lie often enough or as many times as possible , people will soon enough believe you .

section 7 of the treasury act entitles a minister to authorise an unauthorised expenditure , but the authorisation must be granted before the expenditure is incurred .
he then went on to say that we were still living in a very strange society today and that he would tell the hon members why .
the navy and the army and other national institutions worked as volunteers in rounds 1 and 2 to get registration going .
in the western cape we said that we placed a high premium on the the presence of the education officials at their schools in the interests of the children 's education .
in a statement on voter registration , for instance , on 17 november 1998 the government communication and information service issued a statement , which reads , and i quote :
if there is another ruling or another rule in the standing rules that members would like to bring to my attention , they should do so now .
for example , the hon premier would have indicated that from vote 1 he was prepared to give up r65 000 towards the registration process of the iec .
] i am asking this question and i challenge the chairperson of the standing committee to go back to the tape of yesterday 's session .
the hon member is not as razor-sharp as he thinks he is , because he knows that it is impossible to give those details now .
it is a matter of looking for a needle in a haystack , but i will find it if he asks me a formal question .
madam chairperson , all i said previously was that i would not assume that it was teachers , because we also have many officials .
hansard will show that i asked the hon minister whether they are not treating the house with contempt if they are not preparing for these sessions .
madam chairperson , i am rising in the context of a western cape that is burning , and i am sure that the hon minister appreciates that .
the additional allocation to cover the cost relating to the voter registration for the 1999 national elections of r526 000 will flow back to health services .
i have just been out of the house to reconfirm that statement , and the direct quote is : " dit was die ooreenkoms van die begin af .
madam chairperson , my answer to the question put by the hon member ms essop is the same as my reply to the previous question .
it is this premise , that government exists for the least amongst us , that also has to define government 's relationship with the powerful among us .
that which we tick off as achievements stands vulnerable unless we show the requisite will not to hide our pathologies , but to confront them .
governments also cannot be fair weather governments - we stick out our heads when the sun shines and we retreat when the rain comes down .
factually , the da is one party with one future , and most people in the western cape province have indicated that they want to share that future .
let us leave the division in the 20th century and let us move on to greater challenges that we have in this century .
they will claim all manner of reasons for that , but the truth is many anc supporters no longer trust their leaders to care for their interests .
there is indeed , i would suggest , in many ways a full-blown struggle between the authority of the state and the authority of criminal organisations .
we must have no doubt that it is more difficult to deal with gang related crime than it is to deal with taxi violence or bombings .
we have to create a delivery mechanism based within those areas and then the clean up and urban development , painting and upgrading of those housing estates .
that is laudable but it does not necessarily have a long-term impact because we only deal with the soldiers and not the generals .
sir , i also wish to add my voice to those who congratulated the hon premier on his 60th birthday and i wish him well , too .
we have to act upon all strategies that we put on the table for them to become realisable dreams for the people of the western cape .
we therefore challenge what the hon premier said in his opening address because it did not focus on the very deep inequalities of our province .
[ mr m hoza : mr speaker , i support the speech made by the hon premier when he officially opened this provincial parliament yesterday .
we have such things as shebeens in our communities , and sometimes these result in people dying because there is nobody to control them , ...
we challenge the hon premier to show positively that he is the premier of everyone in this province , as he himself has said .
mr speaker , it is indeed an honour to participate in the debate on the opening address of the hon premier to parliament yesterday .
i wish to point out to the hon member mr byneveldt that one should not play politics with this culture of violence .
i believe that public servants can never be compensated for their work , their time and the enthusiasm with which they serve the community .
the hon premier has touched on all the important and contentious matters in his address , inter alia safety and security , economic growth , hiv / aids and job creation .
the opening address of the hon premier was a non-event , and totally irrelevant if it was an attempt to upstage the national event .
the leader of the da has gone abroad with the agenda of sowing confusion and undermining the confidence placed in our country .
the hon premier , true to his colours , is claiming the gains of uneven development brought about by many decades of da , or nnp / dp , policies .
the other fact of that matter is - i know that this is going to gall those hon members - that they are all african and coloured as well .
he has not shared with us what we are going to do about the rising number of street children and child prostitution , which speak to the fact of dysfunctional families .
this enrages me , because it is tantamount to denying poor people a little money that this government had already planned to distribute .
for this reason the trend of thefts , drug abuse and drug peddling , with which prostitution is often associated , is taking root in the smallest of our communities .
my problem with the anc is that they took the side of a person who is not prepared to work and they use him as an example .
mr speaker , the establishment of an interest office in brussels to market our products in the eu and elsewhere is a breakthrough for agriculture .
in the january 2001 newspapers we read that the anc has a plan to end the movement of people out of the rural areas .
two groups of people , 16 and 17 in number , were recruited inter alia in richmond , colesberg and beaufort west by a so-called labour consultant or labour broker from worcester .
the hon leader of the opposition - who is not present in the house - said this afternoon that governments need to deal with realities .
that is the same r48 billion arms deal which will make south africa the owner of four patrol corvettes , 30 augusta helicopters - the same augusta which in belgium led ...
by doing that , however , no foreign country will want to invest in our country leading to isolation , no job possibilities and so on .
the poor handling of the situation in zimbabwe , whether they like it or not and whether it is a dead donkey or not , was wrong .
our programme to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hiv is one of the premier prevention programmes in africa and we intend to make it a world leader .
one of the depressing aspects , and it is no fault of this administration , is the effect that the deteriorating exchange rate is having on our budget itself .
this cabinet , this government and this side of the house stick to their promises and their commitments and that is why it is being rolled over .
] the cape times is far more liberal than the cape argus and i would suggest that he moves over to the cape times .
we cannot get multiparty agreement , if there is an understanding that the chairperson can actually change the report before it is tabled .
madam chairperson , could the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism indicate when the amounts were paid in respect of leeu-gamka and the southern cape .
madam chairperson , what i am saying at 20 : 25 is that i am unable to recall whether there were kmos or whether there were no kmos .
we are actually talking about 17 cameras , which cover an area much wider than just the precincts which are of immediate concern to the casino .
madam chairperson , it will go before the standing committee , as it normally does , but it will also be extensively circulated to ngos and environmental organisations for their input .
( 2 ) the charge-sheet which contains criminal offences such as unauthorised expenditure relating to the redemption of pensions and outstanding car loans to the value of r600 000 ;
as far as law and order are concerned are we not going the same way as zimbabwe , where no respect is shown for the law ?
we in the western cape will not permit ourselves to be governed from any township , neither from guguletu nor from bishop lavis .
i believe that one of our greatest duties as legislators is to be the protectors of the people and the creators of law and order .
mr speaker , it is absolutely irregular for children to be walking long distances in the rain from 05 : 30 to try and get to school .
if one looks at the hansard one will see that in my last speech i raised the issue of people walking long distances .
however , i have a problem with regard to the way they are conducting police operations at the moment , which is driven nationally , may i say .
mr speaker , in this crisis we have to ask - and not in the way that the hon member mr isaacs did - who benefits ?
] the moment i do that , i expect of hon members to support me in the same way that they are now making a fuss .
i am fully prepared to do that and i have checked this with the hon member mr ramatlakane so that we do not speak past one another .
that is so , but i think incidentally it has just so happened that there has never been a notice of motion printed on the order paper on tuesdays .
( 1 ) the pollsmoor medium a section houses approximately 2 000 juveniles ( ages 14 to 21 ) of which about 1 500 are unsentenced , awaiting-trial prisoners ;
mr speaker , i have at various times during the past year kept the house informed about progress in the planning of the cape town international convention centre .
thirdly , the configuration of the convention centre and its surroundings on the current designs will be a world-beater , and it is really all about flexibility .
i also wish to thank the staff of my department for their hard work , as well as those of the department of finance , who did very well .
for some time now the city has lagged behind our counterparts , durban and more recently johannesburg , in developing an international convention centre .
mr speaker , i wish to convey my sincere thanks to the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism and the hon minister of finance and development planning .
i am alleging that there has been very little or no national treasury involvement in the processes in regard to the shareholders ' agreement and the setting up of the shareholding company .
clause 5 ( 1 ) would have accommodated everything , but then we have clause 5 ( 2 ) which reads , and i quote :
in other words , the minimum empowerment requirements which are set in the current bids , particularly for the metropolitan casino licence , had to be transferred to this arrangement .
the current subsection ( 2 ) would become subsection ( 3 ) and we would then insert at the end of this subsection ( 3 ) :
madam chairperson , this official bill is as amended by the standing committee , and the standing committee did not make such an amendment .
( 2 ) that a bill regulating the business of the administration of parliament , which inter alia defines the parliamentary precincts , be drafted as a matter of urgency .
the whip of the anc informed me that it had been agreed that the chairperson of the standing committee would speak before me .
it is logical - if we say the people will govern , let us give the people the right to have their say .
the provincial and national governments may not compromise or impede the ability or right of a municipality to exercise its powers and functions .
we are of the opinion that this is an unnecessary exclusion of the options provided by the local government : municipal structures act , act 117 of 1998 .
] the executive mayoral systems allows an unacceptable measure of political patronage at local government level , which will heighten tensions rather than reduce them .
executive mayors , in terms of the local government : municipal structures act , enjoy sweeping powers in being able to nominate a single party executive committee .
mr speaker , this legislation will go a long way along the road and will set the western cape apart from the anc provinces who are opting for a top-down approach to governance .
nor did the commissioner of the dp support it and the commissioner of the anc has not yet made that clear to me .
then the hon member mr mckenzie peeped in at the door and said , " good morning , pierre " , and after we had greeted one another he left .
it makes one wonder : is this perhaps the reason why we are saddled with long lists of court cases that cannot be disposed of ?
it is the np who spurned these talents and it is obscene for the leader of the house now to pay tribute to those very same talents .
if we think of the results of hearings held by the truth and reconciliation commission , the hand of politicians is clearly to be seen in those pronouncements .
however , i maintain that in such a case a judge will have a better understanding of the context in which the act was committed .
in addressing the issue of this case , i am speaking as if i were the mother of that particular child and the wife of mr abrahams .
if our country is going to establish democracy and democratic principles , we will have to respect the fact that the independence of the judiciary is cardinal .
but the parties opposing this are saying , simply because we want to provide for a complaints procedure , that we want to interfere with the independence of the judiciary !
sir , what i am saying is that the coloured hon members over there told us that one could never ever trust the dp .
the anc 's race mobilisation will be seen through long before mugabe 's , because they cannot fool all of the people all of the time .
] those are the only criteria the anc use and those politics will bring south africa to the brink of destruction and we will ...
we do not have the choice that the hon minister of education has about whether she will fight in this country or whether she will go .
mr speaker , it was people exactly like the hon minister of education that forced me into the liberation movement at 16 years of age .
when we speak for coloured and black people in the province , they say we are using group politics , but it is all right for them to preserve white privilege !
this is a young woman who is employed by a banking institution , and therefore has some benefits from being an employee of a such an institution .
they do not have any sensitivity to the realities that black people face every day - black businesses , black potential home-owners , black people in general .
when the smmes asked that this be confirmed in writing , nothing was forthcoming ; the dp shied away from putting it on paper .
why have they allowed the dp , more particularly the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism , to misuse his government office for a cheap dp political agenda ?
democratic decentralisation is only a worthwhile exercise if an authentic pluralism of views , regional diversity and experimentation is allowed to take place .
the department of economic affairs , agriculture and tourism have recently launched their green paper on preparing the western cape for the knowledge economy of the 21st century .
in fact , we are doing our bit and we are further ahead than any other of the provinces in south africa .
the parliament will now be in recess until 17 july 2000 , on which day hon members will meet in committee to consider the coming budget .
vote 2 - provincial parliament ( auditor-general 's report [ pr 15 / 2000 - page 2 , paragraph 3.1 ] ) : unauthorised expenditure , r18 216,48
they may have forgotten , but may be we should remind them that in 1990 the former city council of cape town commissioned a new general valuation .
the proposal of the government to implement a one-size-fits-all composite rating system across the length and breadth of south africa will effectively undermine competition between municipalities .
madam speaker , this provision in the bill is an express acknowledgement that there are enormous disparities in the quality of facilities and services within municipalities .
the reality is that for as long as they continue in this unholy alliance to try and marry coloured nationalism and white liberalism , they are going to frustrate this province .
madam speaker , it is also quite wrong to single out certain areas and then to say that they never contributed in the past .
they contend that a special category must be created in the bill for agriculturists on the basis of the remoteness and the security situation .
madam speaker , the phenomenon of attacks on farms and smallholdings is of very serious concern , especially , as has been pointed out , the mindless violence that goes along with this .
if we speak about equal treatment then , as the hon member mr lewis put it , we must condemn murder and violence with the contempt it deserves .
report of the standing committee on public accounts , finance , economic affairs and pensions , 1997 ( announcements , tablings and committee reports no. 23-1998 , dated 20 august 1998 )
first report of the standing committee on public accounts , 2000 dated 9 june 2000 ( announcements , tablings and committee reports no. 14-2000 , dated 22 june 2000 )
mr speaker , on a point of order : the sound system is not working , and therefore we cannot follow the hon member mr ismail 's speech .
in many cases payment of the reward is substantially delayed owing to the length of time in which the criminal cases generated are eventually brought to trial .
mr speaker , secondly , we have the collection of taxes accruing to the province , and in addition to that one must take a great deal of care in so far as women 's interests are concerned .
it is therefore with great satisfaction that i report the recent closure of four major illegal gambling operations in sea point , as has been highlighted in the press .
mr speaker , mr van niekerk concluded that there were two instances where malpractices were definitely found to exist .
i think they are waiting to see whether the dp is going to give up its principles on this issue and support the nnp in its cover-up .
are the calls of mr van niekerk , who was appointed by the council , the calls of ratepayers and the calls of their coalition partners going to be ignored ?
one only has to look at what is happening there to know that it must be an embarrassment to the new np .
they did so and they said to me that they believed that there was a forensic report and asked whether i could get it for them .
the hon member mr ozinsky will simply have to bide his time and if he wishes to move a motion , he can do so at the appropriate time .
we have asked for the hon minister , in the interests of a good convention centre , to be removed and replaced , but not by us .
i do not know whether that is a natural bodily function that happens when he is under stress or whether he has actually combed it that way today .
it saddens me to say it , but that relationship has been thoroughly destroyed , more especially by two hon members on that side of the house .
i have made a full disclosure to the board of convenco - in fact , more than i need to .
general report of the auditor-general on the accounts of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1999 [ pr 106 / 2000 ] .
i grew up with them and i do not believe that the muslims are people who will go out of their way to do this .
what contribution is this house really making , apart from saying " national " , or is the relevant minister making a big noise with that kind of input ?
sir , the wave of urban terror by faceless criminals , as evinced in the recent bomb explosions , is rejected by the udm with the contempt it deserves .
it is indeed true that both the national and the provincial governments are responsible for the security of everyone in the western cape , including ourselves in this house .
the udm regards the statements by the two ministers as extremely irresponsible , provocative and as contributing very largely to the tension in our communities .
i am a member of a government - this government - that is committed to upholding the rule of law and constitutional authority .
it is on this basis that i , with my colleagues and other institutions of the state , tackled the crisis in the public transport sector some weeks ago .
we must see whether the milk and honey is available to one and all today - six years later , in the year 2000 .
at velddrif in the same province it is contended that a white female constable said that she would not sit between two " hottentots " in the front of a police van .
i do not need to make a point about race , but hon members know who are farm workers in the western cape and who are farm owners .
brown elderly people there heard recently that they could not use the home 's kombi to attend the funeral of an inhabitant .
i do not want to sound cynical , but should the election of the hon leader of the opposition be seen as a preferential policy on coloured people ?
they want coloureds here to represent coloureds , blacks to represent blacks , indians to represent indians , damaras to represent damaras and griquas to represent griquas .
we can sit in this house and pretend that still today there is no such thing as two nations living in one country .
they claim to represent 99 % of black africans in the western cape , but this is certainly not reflected in their public representation here .
however , the great irony , mr speaker , is that the real affront and assault against millions of our fellow south africans is not being perpetrated by whites ; quite the contrary .
however , it was not a white minister who failed to spend r500 million of her department 's budget destined for poverty relief .
racism is a phenomenon and a challenge that we shall only be able to tackle when we all begin to examine it with honesty and from all perspectives .
i could still understand if the anc were one day to tell brown people that to a great extent they were part of the preferential treatment of the past .
it is a tactic that our society , media , judiciary and opposition must see for what it is , and we must resist it with all our resources .
mr speaker , we are fully supportive of any genuine efforts to rid our country of residual racism and also ethnic discrimination between black south africans .
i think that there are some philosophical underpinnings which deny that racism can be examined and debated at this point , almost seven years after 1994 .
it discourages the establishment of mechanisms to consciously address the real , lived inequalities as experienced by the african , coloured and indian communities .
i am a bit disappointed this afternoon that so few of my former comrades are in their benches to listen to what i have to say .
during the days of the struggle for liberation and now it seems when it was politically convenient for the anc , i was regarded as a black south african .
mr speaker , for the information of this house , two full-page advertisements will be placed in sunday newspapers the coming weekend , in which 64 posts will be advertised .
( 1 ) extends its condolences with the family of the seven-year-old bianca oliphant from oudtshoorn who was raped and murdered by an adult man ;
( 2 ) beatings and evictions of farm workers continue to happen in our province without consistent condemnation from the coalition government and in particular the premier ;
mr speaker , i want to ask the hon member mr dugmore how much he has sweated over agriculture in the western cape and south africa .
we seek stability in the relationship between employer and employee - prosperity , peace and quiet on the farm , where both employer and employee can be happy .
not only do we want the farming community to flourish and thereby create wealth , but we want to empower farm labourers to better their lives .
when the complainant was asked why he was withdrawing the charge his answer was that the anc had encouraged him to submit the charge .
teen ongeveer 3.30 die middag het die sap opgedaag en ges hulle moet my in hegtenis neem omdat ek ' n dame met ' n vuurwapen gedreig het .
today this matter appears on the order paper as a subject for discussion , because the whips must have agreed that it be changed in this way .
report of the auditor-general on a performance audit of human resource management at the department of education of the western cape provincial administration [ pr 124 / 2000 ]
actions took place without any negligence ; the province did not suffer any damage as a result thereof ; and remedial steps had been taken to prevent a re-occurrence ;
the committee heard and considered evidence with regard to the collection of a r5 administration fee from buyers in respect of houses sold in terms of various development projects .
vote 7 - health ( auditor-general 's report [ pr 105 / 2000 - page 2 , paragraph 2.2.1 ] ) : unauthorised expenditure , r3 862 995,10
report of the standing committee on economic development , on the tourism amendment bill , [ b 50f-99 ] ( ncop ) , dated 14 november 2000 , as follows :
sir , one also finds that it is sometimes permitted that questions that diverge from the point are allowed , instead of questions that directly concern the amounts in the committee stage .
why do we not debate how much money the anc is costing the taxpayer because of the senseless arguments they raised yesterday ?
that is the only section in the constitution that we can use for that , and the hon member ms essop used the word " summons " .
as part of the 1999-2000 national adjustments estimate , the provincial sphere received an additional r1,4 billion to be allocated according to the equitable share formula .
( 1 ) the company cipla offered generic antiretroviral drugs at r400 compared to the maximum price of r5 000 per month from multinational pharmaceutical companies ;
( b ) stop hiding behind concepts like market forces and intellectual property in the face of a growing hiv / aids epidemic ; and
mr speaker , another issue is that the hon premier did not mention the youth , women or the disabled in this province .
both the hon premier and the hon leader of the opposition spoke about looking at common purposes and greater visions to the benefit of everybody .
the acdp has for the past eight years endeavoured to play only a constructive role in this province and to add value .
we should stop doing what is politically correct , such as forging relationships with qadaffi and arafat who are socialists , or with the netherlands .
the voters of this province have in 1999 and 2000 again provided us with a clear and unambiguous mandate to govern and deliver .
the hon minister must not try to present other arguments if he knows that they cannot defend what they have done .
] there he told the people that he was in exile for the anc . he said that , even though he was serving in the tricameral system !
mr speaker , that hon member simply needs to be honest and say that the whips agreed to this and cleared it with me .
] the hon member mr dugmore referred to the irene grootboom judgment and gave the impression that it was the western cape government that stood alone in this struggle .
if r1,6 billion was available and unspent on 31 december 2000 , then there is money and the western cape should not be punished any longer .
the foundations of this were laid in the year 2000 and i would like to mention but one example - the clean environment objective that the hon premier has referred to .
this objective can only be achieved through cooperative governance and , as the hon premier has indicated , the cooperation of the citizens of our province .
i will concentrate on a clean-up actually taking place , instead of spending time and resources on policies as to how it should take place .
i will ensure that we work with local government in joint environmental initiatives instead of discussing how we will work with local government .
i have already mentioned the cape coons , but there are also various crafts , ballroom dancing , christmas and malay choirs and similar expressions of culture that i will promote .
the hon member mr strachan explained why , in his view , a certain group of people must be racist because they objected .
mr speaker , i would like to congratulate the hon premier on the landmark address he delivered at the opening of the provincial parliament on tuesday .
mr speaker , if one goes to philippi , one will find that 12 people die - they are killed -every month as a result of gunshots .
i believe - in fact , i know - that should sport be reintroduced effectively in our schools , it could spell the death of crime in our areas .
i want broadly to contextualise these by relating them to globalisation and related problems , and describe the impact this has had on agriculture .
sir , during the election campaign we had a slogan that went , " the da is riding the horse while the anc sits on the tail .
i do not know why he is shy about it , or scared , and tries to hide it and give a different impression - if one is white , one is white .
let us look at the performance of a man whom the hon member mr mckenzie has never liked , for all these years , basil van der ross .
mr speaker , it is very interesting that that mayor goes to eat at a restaurant at mayoral expense , but does not even invite guests to join her .
i am sorry to have to inform him that every time the da wins an election it leaves me feeling younger and more energetic than before .
i believe that the vast majority of south africans of all races , and the majority of the people of the western cape , wish to work together to build our province .
a rather difficult young man , who i will call paul , was expelled from table view high school and taken out of the normal school system for a while .
mr speaker , the hon leader of the opposition yesterday said something to the effect that the nonwhites were poor and the whites were rich .
the hon premier also said that never before in the history of this country has a future held greater promise for all its people .
those responsible for providing these services either do not care , or perhaps it is because of incompetence or a mentality of not caring .
however , there are still people from the disadvantaged community who are complaining that too little has been done to transform our province by means of affirmative action .
mr speaker , the new np believe in the process of affirmative action , which should be monitored regularly because it cannot carry on forever .
i believe and trust that this matter will be looked at again , so that gifted learners are not disadvantaged for the sake of an education budget .
mr speaker , on a point of order : i would like to make sure that the additional two minutes given to me by the chief whip have been included .
however , with freedom comes responsibility and with opportunity comes danger - the danger of making the wrong choices and choosing the wrong road .
yet , even with so little means at his disposal , the hon minister has succeeded in helping to keep good governance in the western cape .
mr speaker , we are always accused of not performing well according to the anc 's barometer of transparency , accountability and transformation .
] if the iec finds that there are any irregularities , it has the right to object and go to court .
if the iec thinks that there were irregularities or interference , why does it not have the backbone to say that we are interfering ?
the scandal of the day is that those hon members involved the iec in a political debate and the iec allowed itself to be led by those hon members .
the anc won the last election - not the new np , not the dp and not their other chums , like the acdp .
] the anc whinges on and on about not securing an outright majority when it is clear that the people voted against them .
it is time for the anc to stop carping about the coalition and to become an effective opposition in order to promote sound governance in the province .
] and his words to me in that meeting downstairs in his office were : " patrick , we cannot afford to lose you .
" the hon premier is not the type of leader to accept strong competition against him , and that is why there is no competition .
we here in the western cape clearly saw an example of something that we had not yet seen from the national government and the anc .
now it is probably down to 55 % as a result of the 18-year-olds who have come in and people who have moved , but what do we hear ?
madam speaker , he then went to a stationery shop and purchased a box of pens , the ink pads and the stationery to take down the statement .
does ms kamfer have any idea of the damage she is doing when she makes up such answers which only serve to show her ignorance and racism .
this helps to cater for visitors to what is now regarded as one of the top 10 cities to be visited in the world .
it is clear that the hon premier 's vision includes the need for a decentralised police service , which will be accountable to our communities in the western cape .
we want answers to these questions and we want to know why this administration wants the photographs and the information on those voters .
it is not a question that faces the anc ; it is a question which the new np hon members have to answer .
the dp refused to accept the need to build national consensus and argued that doing so would compromise the role of opposition .
i think the hon member mr isaacs and the hon minister of local government owe rev sampson and me and the house an apology .
when a decision is taken , it is taken collectively , and not here in this house because the hon member mr dugmore wants it that way .
the hon member mr dugmore has just said that if the new np and the anc go into a coalition , we can work together .
moreover , the dp are the same party that was not only voted in year after year , but also sanctioned cross-border raids into mozambique .
that would be a waste of time because frankly they believe that they have the monopoly on truth and morality and are therefore impervious to reason .
mr speaker , on a point of order : is the hon minister of education allowed to imply that i would condone illegal or criminal actions ?
the hon minister of education goes around with the press trying to impress upon people that the western cape education department is doing something .
my father was so concerned that i would be disturbed by the sight that he covered my eyes because it was so grotesque and spineless .
as a champion of the provinces and being the chairperson , i would have thought that she would take a neutral position and support the provinces .
what was contained in that correspondence is a reflection of the deeper problem that many people continue to suffer from under the administration of the hon premier .
the reality is that former model c schools are still performing well , whereas in coloured and african schools , because of a lack of resources , the results are still ...
the responsibility lies with men to use a condom and to make sure that they do not carry the deadly infection of a sexually transmitted disease .
they recognise that the election victory of 27 april 1994 changed the political landscape , but that the hierarchical racial and class management structure of south africa remained unchanged .
madam speaker , i now turn to the key issue that hampers growth and development for all in south africa , and more particularly in the western cape , namely crime .
the solutions that will deliver relief to our crime-ravaged people do not lie in a single silver bullet ; they are a series of interrelated steps .
madam speaker , i would like to know if the hon member mr fransman is prepared to take a question as to what he did about it ?
the probation services act normally makes provision for criminals , and is enforced when their cases have to be investigated , or they have to be released on bail .
let us rather create a climate in which employers are willing to employ workers than one in which there is increasing mechanisation .
because she is helen zille , she is now complaining about it and saying that everybody should stand up and object , and that something must be done about it .
] i will have more to say about that later , but let those hon members heckle somewhere else , because i do not appreciate it .
madam speaker , at budget council meetings i see , time and time again , other provinces not taking up their full education conditional allowances for their schoolbooks , and so on .
i am sorry that the hon member mr mckenzie is not in the house , and i hope that he reads this or is watching it on television .
over the past three years , a series of strategic planning sessions has led to the adoption of a set of eight main budget-allocation principles by the cabinet in 1998 .
however , it should be understood that these are long-term goals , but what we are doing today is laying the foundation for this to happen .
at the provincial level , the western cape has continued to maintain its underlying pattern of relatively stable , above-average economic performance within south africa 's overall provincial trends .
but , as the most recent wesgro report on provincial prospects for 2000 points out , there are a number of troubling trends which continue to face us , among them :
although personnel numbers have gone down by approximately 20 000 , costs have remained the same or are increasing due to wage creep which results from the central bargaining process .
thus , within the overall national fiscal framework , through a political process , the division of national revenues between the three spheres of government is decided on .
it should also be noted that the budgeted own revenue amounts do not include future possible revenue flows from either casino or limited gambling machine activities .
the salary bill is not easy to reduce , since it covers mainly teachers and health workers who are indispensable to the well-being and development of the western cape .
the active promotion of decentralised hospital management through , amongst others , the expansion of the trading entity concept to all key institutions so as to implement revenue retention at the institutional level .
all debt in arrears , particularly to local government authorities , must be redeemed in full in accordance with a payment and financial schedule agreed to by the provincial treasury .
a growth of about 33 % is budgeted for the 2000-01 financial year , mainly due to a new conditional grant of r238 million from the sa housing fund .
this includes , among other things , provision of proper education and skilling ; appropriate health care services ; enhancing the provision of low-cost housing ; and contributing towards economic growth .
the challenge for the future lies in the creation of adequate financial capacity through the entire province and the development of sound measuring instruments to determine progress .
mr speaker , we can be of special assistance in the processing of claims , as we have just been through a similar exercise , following the manenberg tornado disaster and our west coast crayfish crisis .
a western cape administrative task team will undertake the necessary training of officials for the task of dealing with the expected mammoth number of claims in the stricken areas .
i believe our province , by reaching out to our neighbours in their hour of need , can make a difference , especially in the field of intergovernmental relations .
i would like to refer the hon minister to section 26 of the provincial constitution that deals with the issue of privileges of members of the house .
she not only did not respect the standing rules , or go to the speaker and raise the issue , but went to the police ...
many of them are suffering hardship ; not because the national government does not have money for them - they have r204 million and a lot more money .
our aim with these strategic budgeting objectives is that we from this side of the government , by way of good management and leadership , will lead this province to new heights .
the hon member mr ozinsky referred to the very high standard set by the education department , but this also applied to other departments .
that is why the scof report says in 4.4 that money set aside for that department should not be used by the hon minister .
the hon minister needs to give an explanation regarding these issues , and an explanation as to why she found it necessary to run down to the police station .
mr speaker , the retort by the hon minister that these documents can only be given to us once they have been embodied in the green papers , is cynical .
mr speaker , many hon members have alluded to the fact that the budgetary process in scof is tremendously frustrating , and i personally have found this to be so .
just this weekend we heard about the rape of the tamboerskloof woman on signal hill and the caesarean section where a baby was ripped out of a young girl .
the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation has said , " give me the funds and i will establish a constabulary to deal with the crime situation .
mr speaker , first of all , i want to congratulate the department of finance on having introduced , for the first time , a budgetary system that one can understand .
mr speaker , i wish to add another vital point here , with the permission of the chairperson of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling .
i hope that the hon minister will be able to solve this problem as soon as possible to give our people in the western cape some hope .
in the future consideration will have to be given to moving a bigger slice of the budget cake in that direction so as to generate more money .
i want to make it absolutely clear that that r10 million , when it was allocated from the r135 million of the metropolitan casino bid fee , was agreed to .
for me to go to cabinet a week , two weeks or a month before those regulations are promulgated would , in my view , be stupid in the extreme .
during the second " bosberaad " i shared with my colleagues in the cabinet the business plans for the special desks that i envisaged .
it is a pity that the hon member ms essop is not present , nor is the hon member mr ozinsky - he too ran away .
the poorest of the poor do not even have the money to obtain bar-coded identity documents and are therefore unable to exercise their political rights .
these programmes will be initiated and implemented at grass-roots level on the basis of partnerships with and support for other departments and civil society role-players .
it is really a tremendous challenge and our hon premier has already shown that he is not a person who falters in the face of a challenge .
madam chairperson , i shall conclude with a word of thanks to the director-general and to mr k saayman , the head : corporate services and his top management .
madam chairperson , although i have not come across documentation about the transmission of the infection via this route , i can understand the inspector 's worry .
institutions identified where thefts occur on a weekly basis are the nolungeli community health centre , the khayelitsha community health centre , the dr abdurahman community health centre and the heideveld community health centre .
firstly , 19 wristwatches were purchased for long service awards at a cost of r11 308 , but it could not be established to which staff members they were awarded !
this morning it was only the internal audit presentation that included a breakdown saying , for instance , how many women , how many males and how many blacks there were in the department .
we need to look at programmes that are going to empower women , not a one-day programme or event , such as planning a tea party or whatever .
to do this , it will be absolutely necessary to call a provincial summit with all the relevant role-players in government and in the private sector .
i do not think that the hon premier simply has to find , as he has said , an african minister for the department of social services and poverty relief .
we should deal with the issue of hiv / aids in the province , of which the hon member dr van zyl has painted a very stark picture here .
regarding the question of giving people on the ground access to the domestic violence act , those hon members must do their homework in their constituencies .
mr chairperson , on 12 july 1996 the lobby group for youth , logy , appeared - his master 's voice in the western cape .
within the ambit of all reasonableness , i extend an invitation to all of them for their constructive input and collective engagement with regard to youth development in the province .
if we do not act as professional people in this house then we shall act like certain people in this house - we shali kick up a fuss .
they were like hyenas because none of them could resist having a full go at the hon minister in the office of the premier .
i want those hon members to tell us that they are prepared to help us in this fight , but they do not do that .
mr chairperson , i am quite happy that most of the things that i addressed in my opening address were mentioned in a positive manner .
report of the standing committee on education , environmental and cultural affairs , on the western cape nature conservation laws amendment bill [ b 3-2000 ] , dated 1 march 2000 , as follows :
that the matter of the future appearance of the speaker and the administration of the provincial parliament before the standing committee be referred to the rules committee .
madam chairperson , i wish to express a special word of thanks to the hon minister of finance and development planning for his good faith in the negotiations .
i wish to express my appreciation to the secretary , mr pretorius , who , incidentally , has been re-elected as executive secretary of the secretaries forum of south african legislatures , ...
i also wish to remind hon members that the provisional unrevised speeches are being made available in the library within a day or two after the debates .
a special challenge that will be facing us will be to make the corridors of parliament more representative of our history and cultures .
let us create a timeslot on a regular basis in this house during which our leaders can make important announcements here in the house , where they belong .
why is it that the appointment of staff to capacitate the provincial parliament has less priority than the filling of posts in any department ?
the western cape has the smallest budget with which to fulfil its constitutional responsibility , but despite that we still remain the most effective provincial parliament .
i thank him for his support , and his saying that we should capacitate our parliament because we must oversee the executive .
as i wanted to hear both sides of the story , i proceeded to the developer 's office and met with their representative , one chris mulder .
in fact , the hon minister himself only decided it was a dp meeting when people started questioning what he was doing in that meeting .
if he has a look at the joint statement by the iec and salga , he will also see that salga has become actively involved in this process .
the experience which i gained in the cmc , where we helped manage precisely this process can be used to very good effect here .
the identification of such land is chiefly the responsibility of the local authorities , such as the cape metropolitan council , and every metropolitan municipality within its area of jurisdiction .
of course , consultation is taking place between asset management and housing , and land is not just sold holus-bolus in order to generate revenue for the province .
if the hon member knows of land that he would like earmarked for housing , i would be happy to listen to good advice , but not to silly arguments .
cognisance should also be taken of the fact that none of the january 2000 cape peninsula fires occurred on provincial land .
( 2 ) fire-fighters consisted of members of fire brigades from national , local and provincial sectors , volunteers and private enterprise . private enterprise supplied helicopters .
mr speaker , this issue could have been referred to the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling to apply its mind to the contents of the annual report .
the issue today is that the hon premier did not comply with the law and the house has to take action against non-compliance with the law .
nevertheless , in view of the law using the word " practicable " , there was no urgency attached to it .
( 1 ) what steps have been taken by his department to ensure the implementation of an environmental management plan for the grotto bay coastal estate ( farm 721 ) ;
based on these factors and to ensure proper implementation of the environmental management plan , the clearance of sale and transfer of a number of properties were held back by the local authority .
i also remain committed to ensure that an amended emp is in place and implemented prior to agreeing to the local authority authorising the further transfer of sites .
we still do not have the capacity to police , and i think that is a problem that we are experiencing nationally in regard to environmental legislation .
i am just running through some others : in lotus river and grassy park there were 80 people ; mitchells plain , 1 570 people , and so i can go on .
let us hope that it was neither of these two reasons , but rather as a result of poor advertising of the meeting by the community leader involved .
mr speaker , the last month has probably been one of the most traumatic months for the aged in this province with the transition in the pension payouts .
in answer to the question by the hon member mr silke , as hon members well know , we have agreements with different provinces in the world .
it is clear from the western cape constitution and the south african police service act that the hon minister does have specific powers that he may indeed exercise .
mr speaker , to defend myself , if i may do that , in areas where i do have some say , community police officers are deployed .
at athlone 10 cpos have been deployed , at belhar and delft 11 , at guguletu 13 , at manenberg 16 , at mitchells plain 21 , and so i can continue .
already in the west metropole we have about 12 or 13 police stations which no longer have a visible policing capacity , with the exception of reservists and cpos .
( ii ) monitored council 's progress on an ongoing basis ; ( iii ) gave feedback to the complainant and his legal representative ; and
the chairperson of the standing committee on economic development received a letter from the ncop asking him for input from the standing committee .
we for our part have now offered that we will use those community patrol officers to go on the buses - the south africa police refuse to do this !
mr speaker , the hon member mr fransman asks me whether i am aware of the inhuman brutality which occurs daily against farm workers on farms in the province .
mr speaker , when the owner bought the farm de rust near vredendal 10 years ago , mr mcotshana was already an employee on the farm .
( h ) at the end of the day mr mcotshana died of a stroke and the police decided that no one was guilty of his death .
furthermore , a week before the time - and there are witnesses to confirm this - the deceased asked the farm owner to take him to hospital .
it is in just that way that the entire community of vredendal and the political parties , including the anc , have a responsibility towards those in their areas who are struggling .
the task team made recommendations to the cabinet and certain proposals , which were then amended , after which it was decided that 44 new management posts should be created .
] hon members will agree that there is a major problem to deal with there and the national government must assist in this regard .
those hon members look up to the national government , which has the resources , but they fail to come forward with those resources .
in some areas we find up to five or six little schools , and it costs a tremendous amount to keep them all going .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon minister of education whether it is intended that any other schools would be amalgamated in the near future .
if their figures and their statistics fall then they start losing teachers on a teacher : pupil ratio , and that becomes a very strong community issue .
the message came back , " nothing can happen , because the anc says that unless it is done through them , they will block any development .
once that is in place , the branch : transport will be able to finalise the business plan and i will then table a copy .
( a ) the department is an active member of the technical management committee of the project , with the extension officer visiting the project on a weekly basis to provide an extension support service .
if the hon member also wants me to submit that to him , i will do so , or i will gladly read the summarised version .
we have approval to retain 50 % of revenue and cabinet has supported in principle 100 % revenue retention above revenue targets .
mr speaker , the paper is not before me at the moment , but i can answer it out of the top of my head because i know the answer .
] i would go and investigate the circumstances thereof and find out what actually happened and deal with it if any breaches of policy had occurred .
mr speaker , i want to know whether the leader of the house can confirm that as of today none of the outstanding amount has been paid back .
i intend informing the standing committee shortly on the process followed and proposals by the task team .
it is envisaged to submit the draft green paper for consideration by cabinet towards the end of september 2000 where after it will be published and distributed for comment .
the press phoned the hon minister and me about the management of this matter , and they alleged that there were corruption practices in the subsidy system .
i would like him to ask the national minister when we are getting the regulations , because as soon as we get them we will be able to move on .
if somebody has put a question , i must allow the minister an opportunity to respond to it in the manner that he or she wants to .
anyone who joins the service anywhere in south africa unfortunately has to accept an appointment at the entry level , even if they have many years of experience .
i think generally speaking there is a problem in south africa , and the ratio of patients to pharmacists is fairly high .
the council consists of six members - two from the new np , two from the anc , one from the civic organisation and one from the ratepayers ' association .
( b ) the city of tygerberg has made provision for the establishment of a local disability desk in their financial year starting on 1 july 2000 .
capacity building of persons with disabilities at local level received attention in the form of sponsorships for persons with disabilities representing themselves at national and international conferences .
( 2 ) ( a ) and ( b ) a submission is before the cabinet for the creation of a provincial aids council in the province .
whether the western cape tourism board was in any way , except as a participant , associated with the tourism conference held at the spier conference centre near stellenbosch on 26 september 2000 ?
the words " organised in association " clearly carry the connotation that the western cape tourism board was part and parcel of the organisation of this conference .
what is the current estimated backlog in all the hospitals and clinics of the department of health regarding the replacement and repair costs for medical equipment ?
the pilot project is for special equipped vehicles to provide public transport to registered passengers with disabilities living in the khayelitsha and mitchells plain areas .
what was the amount paid to consultants for the drafting of the regulations in terms of the western cape planning and development act ( no 7 of 1999 ) ?
whether he has overturned a decision of the tygerberg metropolitan local council regarding the venue known as dancekraal in bellville ; if so , what were the reasons ?
mr speaker , my point of order is that the hon premier is deliberately misleading the house by saying that the anc had a march .
let me say to the hon leader of the opposition that i will find the answer to his question and i will give him the answer .
if i cast my mind back , the value of the chrysalis project over a period of three years must be in the r7 million to r15 million category .
i announce further that the vacancies had been filled by the nomination by the nnp of mr c r redcliffe and mr d m malatsi respectively .
thirdly , we will add capacity and muscle to our provincial traffic service to ensure that our roads remain safe and accessible to everyone .
last year we had 428 000 visitors to the western cape from africa - this was an increase of 23 000 compared with the year before .
another good international example , ireland , shows how linkage programmes - putting foreign investors together with local small business - can generate impressive results .
i also wish to congratulate him on a very fine opening address this morning , which i am sure we will enjoy debating over the next few days .
the hon member mr louis talked about the learning process , and that is something that i am very much in favour of in all my responsibilities .
r67,7 million for the payment of service bonuses - commonly known as thirteenth cheques - to those officials whose birthdays fall in the months of january , february and march .
the province also received donations totalling r460 000 during the year , r167 000 of which was directed at agriculture and r293 000 towards health .
we hope that the environmental impact study will be approved by the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs as soon as possible so that the work can commence .
mr speaker , it must also be remembered that it is not the first time that this problem has come up in the house .
at that time assurances were also given by the present hon minister of local government , in his capacity as chairman of the cmc , but nothing has happened since that date .
however , it is not only the khayelitshas and the macassars that are served by these sewage works ; durbanville and the surrounding areas are also served by them .
i was also given the assurance that the cmc would do everything in their power to rectify it as soon as possible for the community .
secondly , i am not aware of properties that have been disposed of from the social services component , but again i speak under correction .
in this letter the departmental official states that the developer is responsible for the rehabilitation of areas where dune vegetation has been destroyed or disturbed through uncontrolled access .
this is being done to further financial management in all departments and also to enable them to comply with the requirements of the pfma .
it should be mentioned that this total excludes claims against other departments and provinces totalling r83 million , which is being followed up through other mechanisms .
while it is still too early to report any meaningful progress , i am able to inform parliament that approximately r189 000 has been collected to date .
madam chairperson , too many guilty of oppression have got away and are still allowed to get away with the economic murder of the masses .
we must support the hon minister of finance and development planning to ensure that the sentiments expressed today find concrete expression in policies and programmes .
is the hon member mr isaacs referring only to the non-compliance of procurement or is there a smoking gun there that we should perhaps be looking at ?
in this formula , amongst other criteria , the demographics of the province as well as the overall economic fortunes of south africa are critical to our equitable share .
madam chairperson , the hon minister has also expressed himself in the budget on his frustrations in securing greater sources of own revenue for this province .
the detail of those motions is debated and at the end of the motion the house decides whether that motion is carried or not carried .
then the current hon minister of finance and development planning took over and accepted that , of course , the anc budgetary process was the correct one , the one to be followed .
the new np is particularly impressed by the monitoring that the department of finance is launching in order to ensure that financial discipline is exercised in the pawc .
] i sat there and i told myself i was going to sit down and immediately start looking for areas of own revenue which we could improve .
having given that undertaking , we were absolutely ready to make the presentation to cabinet , when central government brought in the procurement legislation .
they are doing an excellent job despite the criticism and the steps backwards which they have had to take because of the criticisms of people like the hon member mr gabru .
i would challenge - i use the word " challenge " advisedly - the hon member mr gabru to take his accusations to the gambling board .
of that 10 141 functionally trained police officials , 1 598 officials are utilised in the various staff functions , for instance , the station commissioner or financial services , human resource management and logistical services .
that means that in real terms the percentage of officers on duty absent for one reason or another will always be 9 % of the ideal strength .
this is a constitutional obligation whereby the department plays a monitoring role in terms of the execution of policing and general efficacy and efficiency of the police .
madam chairperson , our target to establish a trauma facility and support personnel at every police station by the end of 2001 is still on track .
the pilot programme is to be funded in the 2000-01 financial year from funding secured from the award of the gambling licence and which will be rolled over from this financial year .
secondly , the department has embarked on a process of drafting a standardised provincial constitution applicable to all cpfs in the province .
madam chairperson , in conclusion i wish to firstly thank every member of the south african police service in the western cape for their often unseen and unheralded outstanding service .
most particularly i wish this house to acknowledge those members who have paid the ultimate price in the service of their country and province .
all i want to say to the hon minister is that it is a fact that there is major change and developments through what he is doing .
it is a simple fact that the car theft syndicates as well as drug syndicates from other provinces are increasingly focusing on the inhabitants of the peaceful western cape .
the lack of adequate policing also causes communities to ask certain questions , and this means that among these people there are certain negative perceptions of the police service .
madam chairperson , this project was born out of the hon minister 's deep , honest and sincere caring which i detected in the hon minister during a discussion with him .
what is the hon minister doing in respect of consultation with the national minister of safety and security about integrating those people into the permanent police service ?
it is gratifying to see that the staff of this directorate are so serious about promoting and developing sport and recreation in the province .
it is also gratifying to be able to say that the directorate is actively engaged in presenting sport and recreation activities in the disadvantaged communities .
we have schools like ncobo in khayelitsha , from where about 10 pupils will be representing this province at national and international level , but they do not have funds .
this day reminds me of the day when the former president was sitting throughout the match , wearing that jersey and the cap , on 24 june 1995 .
i also want the house to join me in saluting people who have made this country proud through their talent in sport .
i would like to focus on the issue of fostering sport tourism and fostering international sport relations , especially with the hon premier 's emphasis on regionalisation .
in studying the plans of sport and recreation , i noticed that they will concentrate on rural facility development for a three-year mtef period .
i shall shake up the department , as i would like to know that these organisations do submit business plans and account for the funds they receive .
hon members should please encourage governing bodies and parent bodies in their areas of jurisdiction to become involved and to set up rosters to go and irrigate the fields .
there is another r2,5 million that comes from our operational budget for community games and events like that , and is not dedicated to the codes as such .
in this regard i would like to make special mention of awards made to historically disadvantaged western cape schools which showed marked improvements in their results .
we should be proud that we are the only province that has managed to attain , and deliver more than , its national housing provision target .
this is a critically important issue in these troubled times when urban terrorism and crime seem to be the only issues newsworthy enough to publicise .
mr speaker , this government is more than ever committed to driving the process of transformation towards creating a people-centered and people-driven public sector .
our efforts and projects already directed at the youth , women and senior citizens , who are at greatest risk , should be enhanced even further .
i want to compliment not only the department , but also santam insurance on donating r20 million , total r5 million and cape argus r5,4 million .
it further centralises decision-making in a country where , one could argue , power is already far too concentrated in pretoria - before and since 1994 .
madam chairperson , great credit must also go to my predecessor , the present hon minister of health , who is now doing similar things in the department of health .
secondly , they need committed teachers who are confident in their grasp of the syllabus and have good subject content knowledge which they can communicate well .
madam chairperson , while it is obviously very helpful to the educational enterprise to have many other things , the three essential pillars are time , teachers and texts .
this is generally below the norm in countries characterised by excellent educational performance , but well above what many of our schools are currently achieving now .
this is necessary to define our current situation , identify the obstacles to quality , and measure progress towards overcoming these obstacles .
mr chairperson , in our efforts to achieve the basics we have also made several key assumptions , which i have spoken about before in the house .
we are also planning a rand-for-rand project in approximately 40 disadvantaged schools to reward those that make an effort to raise funding themselves for infrastructural development projects .
this initiative is in line with the national policy objectives , but the western cape is the only province so far that has made any progress towards achieving these objectives .
mr chairperson , i wish to state very clearly that this standing committee of the western cape province was never opposed to the transformation of these institutions .
at a meeting in paarl last night i once again heard that the feeding scheme at some schools will be terminated with effect from 1 april 2000 .
one can appear in the newspapers and manicure oneself as much as one wants to , one can be photographed all over the show , but that will not change the education system .
i am also pleased to see that murray high school in plettenberg bay will be receiving much-needed extensions to the school to the value of r132 000 .
when i speak about transformation of education in this province i am not necessarily referring to how representative the administrative staff are of demography .
the challenge that faces the hon minister , the wced and indeed all of us , is to play a part in building such confidence .
the perception that clearly exists that pupils of industrial and reformatory schools referred there by the courts can be willy-nilly placed back in mainstream schools , is incorrect .
as far as the feeding scheme is concerned , to which the hon member mr williams also referred , it is true that this falls under the control of the department of health .
we did that because he has shown that attitude and because he is proactive in mobilising the school community and parents to transform their circumstances .
i would like to take this opportunity to share with hon members how we intend to make good on that commitment .
in this way there can be opportunities at our hospitals and clinics , for example , to pursue a more aggressive financial approach similar to what is happening now in regard to school control bodies .
madam chairperson , in this financial year we shall spend r44 million , together with the department of works , on the upgrading and maintenance of health facilities in the western cape .
besides this r44 million , in this financial year we shall also spend r11 million of the so-called casino funds , that will also contribute towards the upgrading of our institutions .
i would ask that we join together - as politicians , professors , nurses , doctors , members of the media and others - to spread this message of hope .
this flu epidemic , which the hon minister mentioned , resulted in a crisis in the hospitals , with routine surgery having to be postponed because of a shortage of beds .
this charter expresses the commitment of the department of health to providing caring and effective services through a primary health care system .
i would suggest to all hon members of this house that this is something that they need to do in order to understand the whole problem of trauma .
at the standing committee meeting this morning , the department indicated that the declines had levelled off , and that it was now maintaining standards at the new levels .
shanty dwellers , aids victims , street beggars and people like abraham fortune do not read the financial mail or academic journals to see how well we govern .
the success of that must go to my predecessors , under the guidance of dr sutcliffe , who has had to manage a very difficult time in health in this province .
we are waiting for the reddy commission which will determine whether this is a function of higher education or whether it remains within the provincial ambit of health .
i have been there , but i will soon arrange for the standing committee and the department to go there to see for themselves what the situation is .
it is one of the first things that i saw , and that is that the management level at day hospitals is not what it should be .
monitoring and evaluation are critical components of the new financing policy to ensure that both outputs and intakes are driven by the principle of value for money .
in the 2000-01 financial year an amount of r1 million has been budgeted and the total estimated cost over the three years will be to the extent of r5,7 million .
in murraysburg , just north of beaufort west , out of 1 301 households there , 81,5 % live in poverty , that is , they earn less than r1 500 per month .
distress relief is granted in the form of essential means of survival to families and people affected by a disaster or incident , in terms of the social aid act .
something which is very close to my heart - this is a challenge to the national and provincial cabinets - is the phasing out of the state maintenance grant .
in the 1998-99 financial year it was r3,3 million and in the 1999-2000 financial year we are looking at 138 cases and a possible amount of r600 000 being involved .
i repeat what i said last week , perhaps such a business plan exist in somebody 's conceptual framework , and i have sympathy with and understanding for that ...
mr chairperson , in conclusion i wish to say that the time has come for us to say to one another that this poverty relief desk is still like a young tree .
we should thank him for having shown the province that we can deliver to the poor and that we can ensure maximum representivity at all levels of staffing .
if 30 slices make up a loaf of bread , i would rather give 30 people one slice of bread each than give three people 10 slices each .
another issue of concern is the court case to do with the new all pay system where telkom has lost the tender for the payment of the state maintenance grants as well as the children 's grants .
as i see it , the only way to address the problem would be to increase the welfare budget of the province or the country .
therefore i think there is a serious need for institutions to be monitored continuously to ensure that our children are safe and well cared for .
the customer service , whose aim it is to manage and deliver a comprehensive , appropriate and affordable social service by establishing district offices in partnership with stakeholders , sounds very exciting .
it does not need a minister in the office of the premier , earning a fat salary , who is even silent on their web page .
the r114 million which has been paid out to parents has been reduced to r60 million this year , whilst the children 's maintenance has been reduced from r86 million to r40 million .
through national networking we need to empower our government workers and seamstresses who now walk the streets in search of jobs , to become owners of mini factories .
madam chairperson , in parliament last week i quoted from the national gender audit which we in the western cape did collectively with the national government .
the challenge we are facing in the year ahead is to maintain the momentum of housing delivery with the limited resources at our disposal .
the persons so displaced will once more become shack-dwellers , only this time they have no hope of ever again being assisted by the state .
even with the increased subsidy amount that came into operation over the past year , the funds available are not enough for an acceptable superstructure .
madam chairperson , i believe that i have brought hon members enough good news to stop them going off to mope .
when i think about this vigorous campaign , i wonder why the hon minister did not talk about the rental housing act today .
give him right to it for life , but with the provision that he cannot have ownership if he does not agree to be part of the body corporate .
at the time when the national government made an offer to the property owners of district six , the price was such that they could not resist .
there is not a provincial perspective which says : " this is the land we want and this is the land we are going to release .
we as the anc are saying that we need to identify all state land suitable for housing and release it at absolutely no cost to those beneficiaries .
her name has been on one housing list after the other , with one excuse after the other for the last seven years - and still she is homeless .
" i do not think , however , that he would be proud to point to the houses being built in happy valley , delft and du noon .
madam chairperson , if there is time left after i have finished my speech , i would like to hear the hon member mr fransman 's question .
the cape metropolitan council and the metropolitan local councils each have their own units that are coordinated by way of a cooperation agreement in the metropolitan area .
they have already progressed so far that resolutions have been taken by the different municipalities to protect the integrity of the future unicity that is to be created .
that is why the people 's eyes will become more and more open , and they will know that the new np is a liability for them in the western cape .
we are even more saddened to hear the hon minister 's comment today regarding the district transformation forum , that once again the smaller parties and independents have been excluded .
there is also still much to be said about marketing and communication from the hon minister 's department in regard to what is happening in the transformation .
if we can make a contribution - and we have already given our inputs - i think we will get that piece of legislation on the table .
i think that the hon member mr n m isaacs put his foot in it when he said that the hon member mr ramatlakane was going to be the new executive mayor .
" they do not want houses for poor people in their residential areas , because they know that those people will probably , in the end , not be able to pay for services .
i can certainly assure them that they will always have access to me and that they will always have access whenever joint meetings are held .
he went on to mention the 4 % of the staff who were actively involved in politics , and noted that the proportion had come down from 12 % to 4 % .
during the first part of his speech i thought he was in the process of winning over the new np , and then he attacked us again .
in order to save time and money , it was agreed upon between the relevant authorities in both the national and the provincial spheres to combine efforts and resources .
madam chairperson , although extensive guidelines have been drawn up for the municipalities by a department of this government , nothing extraordinary has occurred in terms of economic integration .
the land lies right at the heart of the metropolitan area , at one of the main gateways to the city centre , and it is very strategically located next to major transport routes .
this gives them international recognition and status , and these biosphere reserves are managed by a team representing the local communities , agriculture , business , conservation and local authorities .
i find it particularly regrettable that while the province now has an act in place , there are certain authorities that still seek to question the constitutionality of this act .
sir , for record purposes i wish to mention that municipal planning as indicated in the constitution in schedule 4 is a concurrent power between national and provincial governments .
i must also say that there have been some changes and i trust that the eight pillars of transformation are definitely going to make an impact on this department .
therefore i want to appeal to the hon minister , since he has withdrawn the review board , to consider the possibility of making the review board as representative as possible .
there will never be a situation - perhaps in heaven it exists , but not on earth - where there will be no politics involved in it .
i do know who he is referring to , but if it happens to be my predecessor to whom he is referring , i can tell him that it is absolute nonsense .
it is a great honour and privilege to rise as minister of environmental and cultural affairs to present my first full budget speech to the house .
in other words , our sustainable development policies have to ensure that we take the precaution of conserving sufficient of the environment for the benefit of future generations .
in this new budget year approximately five museums will be assisted in transforming their exhibitions to reflect comprehensively the history and demography of our society .
as hon members can see , we have moved away from looking at culture as only those expressions which may commonly be called " high culture " .
i also want to congratulate the department of environmental and cultural affairs on the work of the past year , and assure them of the standing committee 's ongoing support .
my question , however , is whether we can afford not to have professional arts bodies that can showcase the arts and culture of the western cape .
] we are prepared to apologise when we make mistakes , but we would like to see the other side also taking similar steps .
when i look at the 286 libraries in the western cape , i almost gain the impression that the status quo of the libraries has remained unchanged since 1994 .
in today 's modern and humanistic society , it is apparent how " new " value systems have infiltrated traditional cultural expressions ; all in the name of progress and enlightenment .
we welcome the establishment of the western cape cultural commission and there is no doubt that this will silence the criticism regarding culturally biased spending .
it made me realise that we are indeed the razor-sharp opposition , because we are serious about transformation and we will raise it continuously in this house .
according to the living planet index our freshwater ecosystems have declined by 50 % since 1970 , the marine ecosystems by 30 % and the natural forests by 10 % .
i still want to know from the hon minister what criteria are used by this cultural commission and what procedure is followed when cultural organisations in the province are funded .
whatever the hon member 's concerns are , he can be assured that they will be looked at in terms of managing the language committee .
no , the hon minister should make interjections from her own seat , irrespective of whether the house is in committee or the speaker is in the chair .
this was a letter to the walker bay angling and marine conservation society , which made an appeal to the national minister on the decision to close the mouth .
report of the standing committee on governmental affairs and community safety on the municipal ordinance , 1974 amendment bill [ b 4-2000 ] , dated 15 march 2000 , as follows :
that the house remembers those young people from bonteheuwel , viz christopher truter , ashley kriel , anton franch and colleen williams , who sacrificed their lives for a liberated south africa .
] there are objections to the motion being moved without notice and therefore it will appear on the order paper for possible discussion at a later date .
( c ) an affirmative action policy be strategically implemented in the top management of the provincial administration in order to reflect the total demographics of the province ;
] there are objections to the motion being moved without notice and therefore it will appear on the order paper for possible discussion at a later date .
the voters have shown that they have no regard whatsoever for the old np and for that reason they can no longer win elections .
certain sections of the public finance management act provide for circumstances when funds may be withdrawn from our provincial revenue fund as a direct charge .
the roads are at nduli near ceres , haarlem in the langkloof , ebenhaeser in the west coast area , slangrivier near heidelberg , tesselaarsdal near caledon and merweville in the karoo .
the allocated budget for works amounts to r227,173 million for the 2000-01 financial year , which represents a reduction of r49,9 million on the budget of r277,1 million for the 1999-2000 financial year .
at each of these four " obstructions " in the road there was an accumulation of a whole row of cars , and that was between 05 : 00 and 05 : 30 .
i have a fax on my desk which i received this morning in which the voters thanked him and inform me that the negotiations were successful .
this means the local authorities , who have also not been consulted about that piece of legislation , have to go to him and immobilise his vehicle or remove the disc .
these realities are experienced not only as a result of personalities and inhuman relations but also take shape in the activities associated with this vote .
however , this department has had the benefit of receiving funds from the casino bid and an additional allocation of r16 million from the department of revenue .
we in the western cape are privileged to have well-trained construction teams who ensure that the quality of the road network is up to standard in most instances .
the little karoo has experienced three major floods over the past three years and it is specifically the department of transport that has done so much good work there .
mr chairperson , i must say that to speak after the hon member mr gelderblom today is not an honour , and this is a pity .
after the hon member mr ozinsky had raised the problem with the standing committee , the department of works went to the school - two weeks later .
on arrival they promptly told the principal that what they had done , the initiative of putting cisterns in the toilets , was illegal .
perhaps we do not have the same taste - he likes a big office and i am happy with the office they gave me .
the hon member mr king asked me about the regulation , and unfortunately it is regulation 227 of the traffic regulations and we were able to give it to him .
i do not wish to politicise this vote , but the hon member mr fransman must not say that the anc looks after the people of the west coast .
we were having a discussion recently , and i shall not let out here in public the details of what he told me in confidence .
( 1 ) notes with concern that the anc in the northern cape is planning to replace town clerks with party functionaries ahead of the coming municipal elections ;
the cause for this is the unrealistic degree to which labour legislation in our country has been extended , and to which the president referred in his remarks earlier this year .
madam chairperson , the knowledge economy has created a new set of rules of the game , and i would like to look at these new rules from a business or from a company perspective .
some of the biggest challenges are , firstly , to intelligently integrate information technologies with production technologies , because ultimately the knowledge economy is not about it - it is about production technology .
madam chairperson , the third challenge is constant evolution of new more productive routines , typically implying decentralisation of structures and an increased use of qualified subcontractors .
during my policy statement to the house on 7 september 1999 i outlined the five core policy areas that we would develop over the next two to three years .
it must be the role of the provincial government to provide strong leadership and vision , but the greater part of the line function duties must be carried out by agencies .
madam chairperson , we must get away from the idea that alienation of property is the only way in which its value can be realised for the province .
it is likely that almost half of the current entrepreneurs and farmers in that industry will not be there in two or three years ' time .
that is why we are looking forward to the green paper to be issued in may and at the enormous number of paradigms that will , we hope , be produced .
do hon members know that 50 % of residential sales in the western cape are to people investing from the united kingdom , and 15 % are german ?
this does not mean , and there appears at last to be a recognition of this , that we should focus exclusively , or nearly exclusively , on the sunrise sectors .
and last , but not least , the planning policy for the promotion of foreign trade and investment to provide trade and export support particularly to emerging exporters .
and there are numerous complaints , they seem to disappear into the woodwork , with the councillors saying , " there is nothing we can do , this is a legal tavern .
the question is whether the hon minister and the coalition have the fundamental attitude to ensure that the fine plans as far as tourism is concerned are implemented .
i do not think that one can accuse the hon minister of wishful thinking , so one has to seek the reason for his attitude elsewhere .
the strength of product must be enhanced , reinforced and communicated if the western cape is to compete with major international destinations such as san francisco , miami , sydney and perth .
the hon minister and the department of community safety have been instrumental in their supporting of the saps in raiding illegal shebeens at the request of communities .
madam chairperson , in conclusion , the western cape tourism board composition and functioning must be reviewed to reflect the non-statutory nature of regional tourism organisations in the western cape .
obviously we have quite a number of ppps that we are working on and we are developing our skills in this connection , but line function departments have responsibilities to do that as well .
the fact is that in the industries that we specialise in , this is something that can be done throughout the western cape and not only in the metropole .
i wish to discuss a point which the hon member ms essop also dealt with and it is a point that i have dealt with in the house before .
if i remember correctly , the hon member attended our tourism conference at zevenwacht earlier this year , where i gave extensive recognition in public , to her as well .
we have approved - and i speak under correction - about 13 sets of regulations which have come from the local authorities , which we had to scrutinise and which we have published .
madam chairperson , at the end of the sitting i should like to address the house under the slogan , " agriculture reaches out / landbou reik uit " .
new cultivars have to be developed and research must be carried out into irrigation and fertiliser , and besides that it takes 18 months for the tobacco leaf to mature .
we said this last year , and i know that dr van rooyen also said that we are emerging from the doldrums .
this problem is summed up in the following quote : " i cannot make a profit , i cannot break even and i cannot get out .
madam chairperson , in closing i would like to say that we support this budget and wish the hon minister the best of luck in the year ahead .
i must accord recognition to the training which several emerging farmers have received , the land care programme and the appointment of officials who specifically serve emerging farmers .
madam chairperson , the ongoing denial of the role that emerging small-scale farmers can play will result in a decline in the standard of living on farms , unemployment and so on .
when we also take into account that some of these industries are particularly labour-intensive , then this may in future have serious consequences as far as unemployment is concerned .
there is nothing wrong with his thinking , except that the budget will also have to give attention to the socio-economic situation of the farm workers and their children .
madam chairperson , the phrase , " key government outcomes " encapsulates everything that agriculture would like to do , or how agriculture seeks to uplift itself .
only last year two of them completed their studies as medical doctors , and he recalls the brand new bmws he gave them as presents for this .
add to that that the community of farm workers is chronically subject to malnutrition and underfeeding despite the fact that the greater part of their income is spent on food .
madam chairperson , i shall not speak long , because i believe that hon members of this house will be wanting to use some agricultural products .
but i wish to give hon members the assurance that where trade unions become involved in the farms then tension develops as the hon member mr isaacs has said .
that the house support the deputy president 's call that was made in the parliamentary workshop yesterday in regard to what is happening in the region .
to enable the house to take a decision , is it possible for the hon minister to move the amendment now ?
in this regard i would like to make special mention of awards made to historically disadvantaged western cape schools which showed marked improvements in their results .
we should be proud that we are the only province that has managed to attain , and deliver more than , its national housing provision target .
this is a critically important issue in these troubled times when urban terrorism and crime seem to be the only issues newsworthy enough to publicise .
mr speaker , this government is more than ever committed to driving the process of transformation towards creating a people-centred and people-driven public sector .
our efforts and projects already directed at the youth , women and senior citizens , who are at greatest risk , should be enhanced even further .
i want to compliment not only the department , but also santam insurance on donating r20 million , total r5 million and cape argus r5,4 million .
it further centralises decision-making in a country where , one could argue , power is already far too concentrated in pretoria - before and since 1994 .
] there are objections to the motion being moved without notice and therefore it will appear on the order paper for possible discussion at a later date .
there is no doubt that at present the industry has a disregard for government and , to say the least , it needs to be entirely reformalised .
we felt that to impound vehicles would incur many legal consequences , because one would be dealing with people 's income .
it is much needed legislation and absolutely critical in order to give the minister and the ministry the powers necessary to do that .
the taxi operators and golden arrow bus services have indicated that the document goes a long way in addressing the problems that they face in their operations .
lawlessness and the lack of regard for the rule of law are being taken to the limit by these unscrupulous elements - all this to the detriment of the public at large .
i call upon the hon minister of transport and works to take those suggestions and ideas and make them part of the solution .
mr speaker , i should like to thank all the hon members who participated in the debate for their contributions and for their support of this measure .
i want to thank the members of the standing committee who gave attention to this and saw to it that this was incorporated in section 30 ( 1 ) ( l ) .
i then asked the hon premier to allow me to go to the people and accept the memorandum , which i did .
mr speaker , there has been talk for six years now , but it goes in one ear and out the other .
a young girl 's virginity is worth less than two years in jail , and most killers and rapists walk free because of an inadequate justice system .
this means that systems and programmes such as the witness protection programme must be successfully conducted on a sound and professional basis , also for the people who participate in it .
there are now more gang members belonging to the 26s and the 28s in our province than there were five years ago .
i want to ask very nicely - and please help those little penguins next to you - that one rather look at how we can approach the matter .
] sir , how many solomon mahlangu 's must still get the death penalty , while after it is found that it was only to fight for peace and justice ?
is it the attitude of the hon minister that the mourning or cry for help of a brown person in the cape flats is not the mourning of a human being ?
i take my hat off to the police , because many detectives in the serious crimes unit , particularly in the western cape , are responsible for 60 to 80 dossiers .
the constables are going to have hell there , because i am seeking the best possible constables we can get for the r800 000 we are going to spend on them .
it seems to me as though they do not wish to declare publicly today that they supported the iec and the requests by the office of the president .
that certainly smacks of the old centralised political system which questioned why we actually bother to have elections in the first place .
it has become a tradition of the new np members of the house to try to quote the national government against the anc in the province .
] the dp / new np coalition decided not to follow the example of the national government , but to waste millions of rand of taxpayers ' money .
mr speaker , it is our contention that it is only at that point , at the third voter registration weekend , that public servants in the province were paid .
if they feel that something undesirable was done , then they must get up in the house and ask that a committee be appointed to investigate the matter .
let me teach mr shell house that if he finds there is any discrepancy - i am sorry , mr speaker , i withdraw that .
not one of the anc speakers today accused us of going about registering " our voters " or " our people " .
the hon minister cannot possibly know how the money was spent because the money was transferred for the purpose of carrying out the process of voter registration .
madam chairperson , yes , i always need more money , not only from this treasurer but also from the national department in terms of grants .
madam chairperson , given that the hon minister was a member of the cabinet at that time , can he say that he does not know what happened in health ?
yes , that r18 000 would have made a contribution to poverty relief - r3,018 million - but i do not think that is what we should be looking at .
when we discuss my budget under my vote she can ask me what i do with savings , but that has nothing to do with this debate .
madam chairperson , i am sure the hon minister will find out that teachers actually were out of their classrooms on those days .
if the answer to that is yes , why is the hon minister supporting the vote from her department which allocated funds for the removal of teachers from schools ?
madam chairperson , i want to know from the hon minister of transport and works how many officials were involved in this process and at what level they were .
they include pensioners who , having through most of their lives born the worst of the apartheid years , now seek peace and dignity .
four months ago he blamed the national government for urban terror and chastised the national minister of safety and security for focusing on pagad .
such are the vicissitudes of political life , but we cannot afford to be at the behest of what spin doctors want .
as we talk , the sheriff is moving around on the cape flats evicting people from their homes , and in rural towns rdp houses are being auctioned off .
i just wish to add that we do not want to see him retiring in the near future and that that is fairly unlikely , as the hon leader of the opposition will accept .
no amount of nice words will disguise the fact that we face a watershed year in our ongoing war on crime in this province .
mr speaker , at the end of the day we have to be sincere about the day-to-day experiences of those affected by the dreadful consequences of the situation they find themselves in .
people need to know that if they apply for social relief or social assistance or a pension grant , it will not take a waiting period of two years .
mr speaker , what this banner conveys has indeed been confirmed as an observation in the opinion survey carried out last year by the hsrc .
mr speaker , i do want to point out that as far as our gang problem is concerned , we should not go through the exercise of reinventing the wheel .
the hon premier opened the provincial parliament two months after the local government elections and he knows that the da made many promises before the election .
] but in a very dishonest way which does not take into account the fact that the level of exemptions are unacceptably low in all those schools .
like all other da public representatives , i have the responsibility of addressing the concerns and issues of voters in a specific geographic area .
i have taken legal advice on the position of teachers who also serve as councillors and discussed this matter at length with mr o ' connell , head of education .
there is no western cape priority which is not a priority of south africa , whether it is through the da 's short-sighted attempts and miscalculation or not .
many hon members must have read the newspapers over the festive season , in which mention was made of very high levels of drug trade in the knysna and plettenberg bay areas .
mr speaker , speaking of the selected few , it raises a few concerns with regard to the anc 's commitment to democracy , especially in plettenberg bay .
mr speaker , i am sure that the hon minister will never understand the kind of terror that this arouses in the hearts of our people .
mr speaker , we will never allow a holocaust in the world again and we must never allow racism in the world .
mr speaker , on a point of order : i want to express my concern about that remark and the questions it might raise in the house .
what the anc is really doing is to push forward the person who is not prepared to work to the detriment of the people who work .
subsequently the national minister of health decided that each province should have two sites where they would research the scientific and operational issues relating to mtct .
we have a developing crisis on our hands , but unfortunately it does not seem that the country 's leaders have recognised it for what it is .
i disagree with the hon leader of the opposition that the speech lacked depth , as quoted in the cape times of 7 february 2001 .
mr speaker , yesterday in his opening address the hon premier repeatedly mentioned that his government is a government for all the people of the western cape province .
until his back injury , which he sustained during one of his normal working days , mr charles petersen worked on the farm lustigaan for 20 years .
i want to extend my sincere thanks to the hon minister of community safety for the measures he is prepared to adopt in order to rectify other people 's errors .
if the 1 500 farmers must leave their farms due to the severe prevailing drought conditions , 5 200 farm workers and their families will be uncertain of their immediate future .
last year a farmer of albertinia , mr andrew jonker , was charged with attempted murder after allegations that he had driven over a farm worker in a light truck .
it places no emphasis on empowerment and transformation , and that is why they have now stopped outsourcing work to these emerging black entrepreneurs .
mr speaker , i would like to make it quite clear that we are not at the stage of promises on hiv / aids in this province .
i repeat what i said last week , perhaps such a business plan exist in somebody 's conceptual framework , and i have sympathy with and understanding for that ...
the point we are making is that we would like to see a way of spending money that has long-term effects ; not a way of spending money that buys votes in an election .
i will not say it has been easygoing with the limited money , but we have had excellent meetings and things have been moving very nicely .
the particular r10 million that we are talking about here today could not be used unless a business plan was produced for cabinet and approved by cabinet .
madam chairperson , the amount for leeu-gamka was paid in about august 2000 and the amount for the southern cape will be paid in the next month or two .
madam chairperson , i am convinced that the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism has already given the hon member mr ozinsky an answer .
( 1 ) the wave of evictions of farm workers on farms in the province , and in particular the pending eviction orders of 71 families in the koelenhof area outside stellenbosch ;
a petrol bomb was thrown at the bus and golden arrow obtained an interdict from the supreme court to prohibit people in the taxi industry from intimidating them .
he has not accused any hon member of this house of committing a crime , and therefore i shall not rule it out of order .
in my constituency and said that we had capacitated the hon minister to deal with the situation - he is capable of dealing with the violence .
one of the priorities of the hon minister of education is time on task , which is being affected right now by this disorderly social situation .
it is a statement of fact , mr speaker , that on monday last week i phoned the national commissioner , mr selebi , who was going to come down later in the week .
on 30 may 2000 - two weeks later - the hon premier said in a statement reported in the cape times , and i quote :
" the point is this : are the persons who said they would burn the town and bring it to a standstill free or not ?
mr speaker , members of the dp went to the bus industry , and it is their right to have as many photo opportunities as they want !
i want to request that we start with the notices of motion , because the reading of motions does not take longer than five or 10 minutes .
( 3 ) further expresses its condolences to the family and friends of chief justice ismail mahomed and thanks them for lending him to our nation .
against that background , the idea is that cape town - and this is also what the international market tells us - will be the international convention centre .
it is particularly made possible by the fact that the business or company normally pays their attendance fee , which gives the person more money for incidental expenditures .
it is interesting that , according to the notes of kpmg , cape town is considered the 27th most popular city in the world for conventions .
sir , during the initial stages of the casino discussions there was the undertaking that whichever company was successful in the casino bid would contribute to the convention centre .
the gambling board agreed to allow sunwest to contribute r140 million to a larger centre which could accommodate some 5 000 delegates .
once again the hon member mr n m isaacs creates a wrong impression when he says that the auditor-general was satisfied with what had been included in the bill .
the ultimate capacity of the proposed convention centre has not been finalised , but a flexible facility to seat delegates is under consideration .
we will ensure that the required legislation will be passed timeously in order to fast-track the cape town international conference centre at the base of the majestic table mountain .
although convention centres do not usually generate commercial returns on capital invested , their downstream effect on hoteliers , restaurateurs , retailers and suppliers is well recognised in australia .
the emphasis is therefore placed on operating profitability and wider economic benefits rather than on return on capital invested .
that in itself could ensure that enthusiastic entrepreneurs , who visit the convention centre , may perceive new possibilities in the western cape and come up with new innovative ideas .
thirdly , mr speaker , the province did not engage in any discussions with the national treasury about the entity that we were creating .
i wish to raise a fundamental problem that we did not have an opportunity to address because we were not given an opportunity to look at the shareholders ' agreement .
- if the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation would like to listen - i quote from subsection 136 ( 2 ) ( b ) :
in the discussions in the committee meeting the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism refused to delete a clause that i believed was redundant .
secondly , if we are going to have any additional capital from a third party it is not going to come from sunwest ; it is going to come from another party .
the hon minister is discussing the motivation of the hon member , whereas he has already had his two minutes to give his motivation .
if the original text remained , with the name " convenco " as an amendment , it would not be a problem ; that was agreed to .
madam chairperson , i would therefore ask that you make a ruling that we proceed with the amendment of the hon member or anything else that she may have .
furthermore , invoices and supporting vouchers for these purchases as well as other purchases amounting to r10 689 ( total r43 695 ) could also not be submitted .
vote 16 - transport and public works ( auditor-general 's report [ pr87 / 1999 - page 14 , paragraph 3.13 ] ) : internal checking and control
when this question was put to the representatives of the department in the standing committee meeting they said , " no comment .
mr speaker , we would have been quite prepared to explain it to the hon minister in detail if he had not known what was going on .
they should try to win back the people who have turned their backs on them by taking a decision that is constructive for the western cape .
mr speaker , i do not want to go into further detail with regard to the system of proportional representation or a combination of proportional representation and wards .
in terms of chapter 7 of the constitution , local government is a sphere of government in its own right and no longer a function of national or provincial government .
this may also have the effect that the financial budget will be manipulated by an individual who will dance to the tune of his political party .
i do not believe that local government is ready for an executive mayor for this five-year term , and this could perhaps be proved wrong after three to four years .
mr speaker , perhaps one could concede one point to them , but they say that we are possibly afraid of an executive mayor here and there .
that is why zimbabwe has fallen to almost rock bottom position , because of instability and because their president does not care about or respect the rule of law .
( 2 ) the courts are independent and subject only to the constitution and the law , which they must apply impartially and without fear , favour or prejudice .
if we go back 40 to 50 years to the history of our country , it is clear that there was a reasonable degree of political interference in the legal system .
the current minister of justice , mr maduna , who has already been quoted in the house , also said that judges are loafers and they go overseas .
that hon member will soon have to withdraw his allegations - and then it will once again be the judge 's fault that he has to withdraw his allegations .
the first reason was to see if the np were serious in their decision to reach out a hand to uplift the coloured people .
because the dp-controlled city council decided that prince george drive should be a dual road where the whites lived and a single road where the coloureds lived .
] however , the hon member still rationalises and supports communism , and he is still a proud representative of a system that killed innocent people .
" the new np cannot hope to play the dp at that game , because the dp plays this brand of politics with far greater aplomb .
] that is what they are actually saying - the anc is black , zimbabwe is black because the whites have left zimbabwe , and therefore the anc is zimbabwe .
all they want to do is bite at the heels and find little faults all over the show , because the real project of nation-building eludes them .
i was worried that my authority had been circumvented , that they had arrested the hon minister on the premises without the speaker 's having noticed !
recently in the newspapers we heard about a mr shane cooper who lived in manenberg , and who was also denied a home loan .
this just once again reflects the complete lack of understanding that both those parties , which represent minority white privilege , have for the large majority of black people in this country .
mr speaker , it is time that the coalition partner of the dp - the new np - woke up and realised that there is something wrong .
the public is paying the salary of the hon minister to genuinely do this work , but he is playing a double political agenda and misleading the struggling business people .
south africa 's rigid and demanding labour legislation , which is wholly unsuited to the reality in which our economy finds itself , has discriminated our ability to compete internationally .
we are not dealing with an alice in wonderland market where things happen because we want them to ; we are dealing with reality .
we wrote to the human rights commission and pointed out some of the allegations of racism and asked them how we could go about dealing with them .
we therefore asked the human rights commission to be alert to the fact that we might need an investigation into these allegations of racism in banks .
this approach is based on a recommendation received from the human rights commission that this would be the best way to establish a prima facie case .
we have since then been approached by business people in gatesville / rylands who want a similar meeting in their area , and that will be set up in a week 's time .
if the anc do not know what to do , they call a conference , and that is in fact what they had , where the problems were defined .
] that is why those hon members come to me and say they have absolutely all the problems identified , but none of the solutions .
in every single one of those countries , even every venture capital or enterprise capital institution will tell one that they bargain on a one in six success rate .
three weeks ago , together with the deputy minister of trade and industry , we launched the new cape venture capital fund , which is aimed exclusively at businesses from previously disadvantaged communities .
- three crucial requirements have to be met in the process of reproducing examination papers to ensure the integrity of the exams namely -
- management ( which included the director-general and head of the education department ) diligently applied its mind with due consideration to potential risks and financial implications ;
] there are objections to the motion being moved without notice and therefore it will appear on the order paper for possible discussion at a later date .
( 1 ) the extensive environmental damage to the marine resources and the coast of the province as a result of the pollution caused by the ship , treasure ;
mr speaker , on a point of order : i wish to ask whether the house can adopt that motion since it is vague and confusing .
the hon minister will hand it to the messengers for transmission to the table and the chair will decide whether or not it will appear on the order paper .
madam speaker , this is a topical issue right now and we thank you for placing the topic on the order paper for debate .
madam speaker , on a point of order : is it permissible for the hon premier to make unacceptable hand signals to another member of this house ?
finer detail pertaining to the criminal acts themselves , the perpetrators and the victims is not available to allow for the testing of certain hypotheses .
the western cape parliament must support the representations made before the portfolio committee of the national assembly yesterday by agri sa in regard to the arms control bill .
madam speaker , to begin with i should very much like to thank the hon member mr williams for having placed this subject on the table for discussion .
in the period 1 january to 31 december 1999 there were 52 incidents of attacks on farms and smallholdings in the western cape and 11 cases of murder .
in the case of the murders of the marais couple , it is alleged that the murders were committed because the accused were not satisfied with their salaries .
the anc and i and my family mourn that loss , just as we mourn the loss of valencia , aziswa , chantene and all the others .
die burger of 1 may 2000 quoted the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works as follows , under the heading , " nnp prys wes-kaapse plaaswerkers " :
the hon minister went on to say , " ons moet nie net oor plaaswerkers praat nie " , as if by saying that he was also saying that that had been done .
this debate concerns murders , and generalisations have been made here and farmers have been accused of things that they have not been convicted of in court .
i really want to appeal to the president of south africa to show us for once that he too is serious about the rural environment .
( 3 ) urges communities in the province who are still plagued by a high incidence of foetal alcohol syndrome to take a strong stance against alcohol abuse ; and
( 4 ) notes that crime in rural areas is growing rapidly with gangs now also spreading their activities to these areas ;
we are all aware of the dangers involved in this type of operation and we are especially grateful to all the authorities who took part in the successful raids .
in effect this would enable them to possess the relevant gambling devices for the period of time and at the place stipulated in the authorisation .
together with these amendments , and that in respect of gambling , we on this side of the house wholeheartedly support the western cape ninth gambling and racing amendment bill .
in any event , if the hon member is convinced that this is the case , it is not for the chair to judge on it .
i wrote to the task team on 10 august 2000 and told them that in order to evaluate the report these are the things we can do .
] he and a number of similar white businessmen in this province have had this kind of approach as to how we do business in this province .
the companies act is relevant to his participation as a board member , and if he were not a member of the cabinet , we could have stopped there .
mr speaker , i cannot understand why the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism is so dead set on remaining on that board .
he must be removed from the board of convenco in the interests of this province , good governance and the future of the development of the cape town convention centre .
we actually have an attempt by the anc to take a project which is vital in the economic interests of the city and politicise it .
what raises our suspicions even more is the fact that the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism first said , " i have no interests .
" i cannot call the hon minister a liar , but i can say , according to your ruling earlier , mr speaker , that that is a lie .
we should keep to the conventions of the house ; otherwise hon members will start to retaliate and that will affect the dignity of the house .
however , a previous speaker confirmed how much she knew about the companies act , but i am afraid to say she knows very little about the companies act .
the point can never be made that it is an overreaction or that it could be a form of dictatorship - we have already heard those noises .
mr speaker , in recent months the people of the western cape have had to grapple with the realisation that violence in the province has moved up a level .
( c ) an affirmative action policy be strategically implemented in the top management of the provincial administration in order to reflect the total demographics of the province ;
let us unite to fight racism , but let us equally resolve to stop attributing criticism of poor performance , low productivity and incompetency to racial attitudes .
] mr speaker , unless there is uniformity in thought on those issues by political leaders , there will not be uniformity in thought amongst our followers .
in this day and age , to have 70 % of the senior posts in the civil service being white is not redressing any legacy .
mr speaker , when we quote the words , " it is ludicrous for a school psychologist to refer a jewish boy to a black muslim school " , ...
mr speaker , it is said , " it is ludicrous to send a jewish boy to a black muslim school " - a summary of the quote .
the anc 's approach once more encourages south africans to judge each other by the colour of their skins rather than the content of their characters .
they have abandoned their legacy of non-racialism and forfeited their claim , which was never valid anyway , to having a monopoly on morality .
we are all guilty of seeking to rationalise our concepts of racism and affirmative action , to condone or defend them in order to try to justify our viewpoints and conduct .
if the same people who fought to embody human rights in a constitution grossly neglect human rights , even in regard to affirmative action , then that is unacceptable .
therefore , the disappearance of apartheid from the statute book and from the constitution means that we have now removed apartheid and that our non-racial reality is at hand .
if one looks at education , one will see that the financially mobile sectors of the coloured and african communities can go to the former model c schools .
that the house notes the tragic death of mr welcome zenzile , chairperson of the transport committee of the cmc , in a car accident between beaufort west and aberdeen .
that the house , noting the arbitrary removal of mr a ismail as chairperson of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling -
the hon member mr n m isaacs would no doubt be prepared to accept that as " congratulates " so that it can go through the house unanimously ?
( 2 ) therefore calls on all south africans to support the october campaign of the anc / sacp / cosatu alliance for the transformation of the banking sector .
( 1 ) congratulates the national minister of environmental affairs and tourism for implementing the required mechanisms to ensure the long-term sustainability of the fishing industry ;
] there are farmers in the riviersonderend and riversdal districts who have been found guilty of calling their workers " hottentots " and " kaffirs " .
] throughout the year he has persisted in making attacks on our hon minister of agriculture , property management and works ; now he is also laying an egg .
whilst these statistics do not excuse some very serious cases of abuse on farms , they certainly go to show that one should not make blanket accusations without adequate proof .
on one occasion ms marike de klerk contended that brown people were not white nor were they black , that is to say , they are not people .
i ask him to investigate what goods are sold at what price at that farm shop , and at what price they are sold in the town .
i know , and i am convinced , that 99 % of the black people are good people , so i am not generalising , nor am i saying that all black people are criminals .
provincial treasury replies to the report of the standing committee on public accounts , 1999 ( announcements , tablings and committee reports , no. 4 - 2000 , dated 28 february 2000 ) .

report of the public service commission on the management of probationary appointments within public service departments at national level .

as this is the first opportunity since last year 's elections , permit me to deal with the major shifts under the applicable headings to the adjustments estimate .
he promised the rebuilding of the schools , but when we go to central treasury for them to come up with the money , this province received ...
( 3 ) the national government has been at the forefront of attempts at parallel importation of cheaper drugs for hiv / aids and other ailments ;
i wish to take the opportunity of thanking the director-general and all the directors in the departments for setting a very high standard .
lastly , i want to congratulate the hon minister of social services and poverty relief - i do not see him here - on his maiden speech .
if we are not going to talk up and encourage entrepreneurs and pioneers to develop in this province , we are not going to have those jobs .
look at how the people in the western cape spend their money : 40,9 % on eating out , 34,4 % on gambling , 19,5 % on movies and 12,9 % on sport .
it is about the fact that as we speak , as the hon premier speaks , there are people in this province whose aspirations we are not advancing .
mr speaker , if i can give the hon member mr dugmore a nightmare by his looking at me , it will be my great privilege .
we need to combine tourism bodies in this province , and i will make every effort , in cooperation with local government and others , to implement this goal .
good governance and a corruption-free administration is what we intend to maintain in the western cape - somewhat different to our anc-ruled provincial counterparts elsewhere .
in fact , if one looks at the facts , the da do not have the mandate that they are trying to claim , which the speaker before me did .
they have brought them to this one corner of the country , saying , " let us fight them from this point and try to gain the country again .
how did we manage to place people from military intelligence in their ranks in order to give patricia de lille information about the arms scandal ?
without elaborating much on this , let me say that the western cape has overspent on its housing budget every year ; that is , we have spent more than was necessary .
i appeal to the members on both sides of the house - let us agree to work together to build the western cape .
mr speaker , before i start the speech that i prepared , i feel i am duty bound to say something political in the house today .
we now have to ensure that the structures and processes that are already in place deliver results and that people recognise that this government is working for their benefit .
i will also be launching a household waste separation project in mitchells plain this month which was initiated by us and is being funded through the national poverty relief funds .
i encourage their participation in this regard because it is in the interests of good governance that my actions and decisions are held up for scrutiny .
mr speaker , on a point of order : is it permissible for the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism to be reading the newspaper in the house ?
the western cape , under the leadership of the hon premier , stands out against this gloomy backdrop as a prosperous place to live in and to work in .
the department of transport is also active in the promotion of rural development by way of access roads to smaller communities and public transport studies aimed at improving service delivery .
mr speaker , it does not surprise me when i see the hon members on the other side becoming furious when racism is mentioned in this province .
if one goes to the mitchells plain magistrate 's court one will find that 60 % of the cases are being thrown out because of a lack of information .
these main behaviour dimensions that i have just mentioned are very important to bring about the holistic sports person and to bring about a responsible adult as well .
that approach smacks of the racist attitude of mr verwoerd , in his speech in 1953 on the bantu education act , when he said , and i quote :
" hearing this , i became horrified , because clearly the hon premier must know that such an audit without a plan means nothing .
we should link it up with the marine fishing industry in the western cape , especially to ensure a sustainable industry and a lifeline to subsistence and artisanal fishing communities .
as the hon member mr mckenzie said , " we will be there for our people ; every day of the week we will be there for them .
( 1 ) noting that da councillor , mr ian iversen , is leading a campaign by certain residents in newlands to prevent soccer being played in newlands ;
( 2 ) believing that soccer in the province has never been given the recognition it deserves by the nnp , coalition and da governments respectively ; and
some of the other contributions - by the likes of the hon members ms phenduka , messrs jacobs and r williams and ms phike - are best forgotten .
it is this kind of sentiment that undermines all the positive achievements of the parliament of the world 's religions which we had in cape town recently .
i am personally going to arrange for a meeting with the jewish board of deputies to take this letter to them and ask them to comment on it .
while one of the main objectives of the new education system is to eliminate sectarianism and racism , our hon minister believes that it should be reinforced .
crime and poverty continues to haunt our society , tourists are being murdered , children are being raped and we in particular are concerned about the dead-hand of division in our government .
in the interests of stable government in the province the governing parties owe it to us to have a strategy to cope with this reality .
when studying the opening address of the hon premier i was tempted to measure the success of the province against these pillars .
i congratulate the hon premier on the appointment of ms helen zille as minister of education , particularly on account of the success she has achieved up to now .
mr speaker , on a point of order : the hon member mr ozinsky never said in his references that he had invited the iec here .
we must encourage departmental discussions on a regular basis on issues such as the effect of hiv / aids on our lives and on those of our colleagues .
not only did the anc win the national elections and the elections in the other provinces , but they also won the election in this province .
since the general elections in june 1999 , to date there have been 16 by-elections in this province and the np have lost 14 of those 16 by-elections .
mr speaker , on a point of order : is it permissible for an hon member to read a newspaper in the house ?
ask the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism if he did not have papers listing who would be in his cabinet .
the first response of the hon leader of the opposition to the hon premier 's speech was , " here they come with the black peril .
it is the anc government that initiated the process of building houses for the people who were dumped and dehumanised by the apartheid np government .
madam speaker , we on this side of the house are charging the hon premier and his cabinet with a cover-up , incompetence , misleading the house and negligence .
i am not saying that the hon ministers of local government or of agriculture , or the hon member mr gelderblom , necessarily have to join the anc now .
i would like to refer to the accusation by the hon leader of the opposition that the hon premier is patronising , as reported in my quotation from die burger .
the cape argus reports today that the national minister of transport has said that he will help , as far as possible , to eradicate racism in the taxi industry .
my request is that we all work together to support the hon premier , and thus enable him to lead the province to new and better heights .
as a politician and an anc activist i have tried to convince my grandmother not to do this , but she is absolutely fearful of white people .
" i said , " but this is my money , and people of the same colour as i am come and shop here , just as i have done .
mr speaker , it is not racist to require our school clinics to be sensitive to the religious orientation of students and their parents .
they are increasingly seeing beyond the propaganda of the anc and they are doing it faster than the poor in zimbabwe saw beyond robert mugabe 's propaganda .
we do have the power , as do former anc politicians , for example in idoc and the office of the national director of public prosecutions under bulelani ngcuka .
there are signs that society in this province has gone beyond the denial stage and has started to accept hiv / aids as a reality .
mr speaker , after hearing the hon premier 's opening address , one can point out significant enemies of the western cape and its people , namely crime and unemployment .
those who reek of money , if i may use that expression , are still mostly white , while those living in the most awful poverty are virtually exclusively black .
the reason for using technology is that the national government is in the process of improving the lives of everyone , including those of the farm workers .
moreover , this omission served to confirm the obsession of the hon premier and his coalition partners with the aesthetic and the abstract , such as , and i quote :
madam speaker , on a point of order : i would like to know whether the microphones are working , as i cannot hear the hon member mr ozinsky .
madam speaker , over the last two days we have had to listen to the anc endlessly sprouting their sanctimonious twaddle that only they know how to deliver .
to my shock , and after i had listened to the speeches of his ministers , i realised that the word " meaninglessness " described his coalition government perfectly .
madam speaker , the reason why i did not take the matter up was , of course , that we had taken these matters up before and nothing had been done about them .
on 27 september 1999 we received an acknowledgement of receipt from the office of the president in response to our letter to him of 29 july 1999 .
madam speaker , i want to tell the hon member mr gelderblom briefly that when a street is resealed , that street remains a tarred street .
the matriculation certificate examinations that we had to write were much more difficult than the lower-grade matriculation certificate examinations of the department of education - the old white schools , the old model c schools .
madam speaker , i regard it as virtually an insult that for this entire debate today , the hon leader of the opposition has been absent from the house .
the people there are desperate for schoolbooks for their children , and yet they do not even take up their conditional allowances in order to pay for those schoolbooks .
with the previous principles as departure points , the cabinet 's latest policy and service delivery goals determined during 1999 have resulted , among others , in the following fiscal principles :
the provincial government has had to survive another year of reduced transfers from the national government and a painful disciplining of expenditure on health , education and welfare .
the big three spending sectors - education , health and social services - consume 92 % of the province 's total salary bill , and this figure excludes administration costs .
( a ) budget inputs must be made relative to specified targets / outputs at institutional level and long-run outcomes for the department of health as a whole ;
other possibilities are in the main dependent on the national department of finance drafting a provincial taxation legislation framework that must indicate the available taxation resources open to provincial governments .
( c ) the provincial revenue plan endeavouring to give greater guidance to provincial departments should be implemented during the course of this year .
( 2 ) requests the relevant departments , in particular transport and agriculture , to urgently determine the extent of the damage in the little karoo / southern cape ;
the committee supports the community patrol officer ( cpo ) scheme , but recommends that the minister investigate the legality of the expenditure as well as alternate ways of remuneration .
if the government realised that they are not allowed to run voter registration , they would not put issues of voter registration in the budget .
secondly , we are making the first moves towards higher expenditure on key projects and services in support of stronger economic growth and job creation for our people .
are we not relieving poverty when we spend money to provide education to the children of impoverished families in heideveld and manenberg , or thembalethu and lawaaikamp ?
sir , i must say that i expected more from the hon leader of the opposition than to dabble in this kind of hateful divide-and-destroy politics .
] if they want to fight us on caring for the poor , we will direct the massive anger of common people about broken promises against them .
with the coming of casinos in the western cape the income generated from our province in the financial year may rise to a possible 11 % .
but after all , it has become the custom on the other side of the house that when their arguments dry up , the new np are criticised as the old apartheid demons .
in his 100-day speech , for example , the hon minister of finance and development planning said that he would put procurement policies on the table ; he has not done that .
as hon members know , we are short of 7 000 to fill the capacity in the western cape , and this would cost us r240 million .
the speech of the hon minister is also fresh from a weekend of intense dp propaganda , because he used every phrase that was a sound-bite on the television .
on the other hand , if one wants a view of the harbour , one sometimes wonders where the urge for a harbour view originates .
] i was raising two loyal members of the anc , but i can tell hon members that they are no longer members of the anc .
mr speaker , i agree with what the hon member mr gelderblom said , especially the issues which he raised with regard to my speech .
in my 100-day speech i gave an undertaking that i would report to cabinet within five months about my new or recommended policy on procurement .
through all of our nine policy objectives there is the golden thread aimed at improving the quality of life of all the citizens of the western cape .
we now also have a provincial strategy document on persons with disabilities , while the first provincial gender audit has been submitted to the national office for the status of women .
the department of provincial administration has notched up quite a few successes in different fields such as international , national , provincial and local relations , our internal audit and our human resource management .
it is just that the figures relating to population , school-going children and hospitals are underestimates in our case - and only in our case .
and what is perhaps more important - when god no longer plays a role in one 's life , i believe there can be no future .
i want to say to them and to the hon member mr strachan - they accused me so falsely - that they are indeed disgraceful liars .
against this background i should like to convey to hon members today in practical terms the services that the administration can expect in the coming year from corporate services .
i know that i am still wet behind the ears but as a politician , green or not , i too can add my penny 's worth .
according to her , the department 's inspectors appear to be somewhere up there , far away from the ground staff , the ones doing the job and being in the line of fire .
of concern too , madam chairperson , is the serious and almost chronic shortage that the subprogramme , legal services , has in attracting and keeping legal drafters .
all we hear in the house is that she addressed the youth at goudini on a certain date , but there is no clear programme .
we wish to say to those involved in this office that we have come a long way in the effective overall management of the provincial government .
somebody here said - i think it was the hon member mr silke - that the anc sees racial issues and transformation in terms of the colour line .
i think that the events that the hon minister in the office of the premier was talking about were the preparation for 8 august , and these are just events .
whenever i raise these issues the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation tells me to go and tell national government .
in fact , the eu has rejected this coalition and suspended all bilateral agreements between themselves and austria and , what is more , jrg haider has been branded as the second hitler .
i cannot understand why in a province like our own , where only three reported incidents of malaria have occurred , we have a malaria clinic .
on 26 june 1996 the letter from the hon member mr dugmore , who is not here , deals with the youth smt confirmation of nominees .
for the first time in the history of the united nations security council , they were discussing a health issue - and that health issue was aids in africa .
i want to add that the state of california has now approached us as well , and it is the seventh-richest state in the world , so this western cape is going to ...
the committee supports the community patrol officer ( cpo ) scheme , but recommends that the minister investigates the legality of the expenditure as well as alternate ways of remuneration .
the committee supports the department 's hiv / aids and tb initiatives , but would like to express its concern that the malaria institute is not included in these initiatives .
madam chairperson , it is indeed a privilege to be making my maiden speech on a budget that has increased by 57 % and is at least beginning to look like something .
the prescribed procedure for parliament to obtain its budget , namely that the speaker negotiates directly with the hon minister of finance and development planning , has finally been settled .
mr j retief , who acted as national chairperson of the group concerned with libraries and research for all the legislatures , has voluntarily been supervising a number of interns .
yesterday , when the hon premier was making an important statement here , i wondered why our ministers and our leaders have to hold press conferences and media conferences out there .
no matter that the speaker of this parliament happens to come from the ruling coalition ; he must stand up for the needs of the provincial parliament .
after all , the constitution so directs , and the speaker is , in fact , protected under this constitution in standing up for the rights of the provincial parliament .
it would be an outstanding idea if the standing committees did get a dossier of high profile topics for each one of the portfolios that they address .
the former members are still members of the commonwealth parliamentary association , but i doubt that hon members would distinguish them to quite the extent of sending them on overseas trips .
mr andrew west , who attended the meeting in his official capacity , advised me that to physically visit thesen island i would need a 4x4 vehicle .
mr speaker , if the developer had looked at the principle of talking to the interested and affected parties , this appeal could have been avoided .
why does the hon member mr winde issue a press statement on behalf of the dp saying that this meeting was arranged by himself on behalf of the dp ?
how will the funds budgeted for ( a ) the registration of voters and ( b ) the assistance with the applications for identity documents be spent ?
it is clear from the recommendations of the tender board - which we have in front of us - that the tender board rejected the provincial government 's voter registration initiative .
i would like to ask whether the anc is prepared to go along with the registration campaign and whether they will make their own members or supporters register ?
mr speaker , right up to today the cmc is still looking for all the places where photographs were taken , because the details have not yet been provided .
i would like to ask the hon minister whether , in future , he will first investigate cases before he widely rushes off to the press and makes emotional statements .
the department of environmental and cultural affairs was not involved in the establishment of that commission , but participated actively in the fire task group appointed by cabinet .
( 1 ) the board shall as soon as may be practicable after 31 march of each year submit to the premier a report on its activities during that year .
if the hon member ms essop believes that it was not done in an open fashion and in terms of the law , then she should point that out to me .
if i remember correctly , and perhaps the hon minister will also remember , this was the tbhc that he was not familiar with at the time of the budget debate .
mr speaker , first of all , one is very sad and disturbed that our aged , who have played their part in society , should be in this predicament .
the question should be put to the anc , which is at the moment doing its utmost to discredit the community police officers scheme , what it has in mind .
the questioner may want to direct a question in this regard to the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs who , of all those in cabinet , is probably the most directly concerned with this .
the department of economic affairs , agriculture and tourism will be commissioning a tourism development framework during the coming year , which will focus on the various development challenges and opportunities in the province .
that the applicants ( only one vehicle per household ) would get entry to their homes and not the beach , subject to the existing coastal regulations ; and
( 3 ) whether he will make a statement on his or his department 's commitment to contribute to the national debate on this issue ?
we have been contributing to this debate both at political and official level since i became the minister responsible for economic affairs .
mr speaker , as a final follow-up question , can the hon premier give this house a commitment today that he will never join the dp ?
mr speaker , the commuters , in the cape metropolitan area mainly , are bearing the brunt of conflict between taxis and golden arrow bus services .
the silence of our national government and our leaders , with their softly-softly approach to president mugabe who is a tyrant , does not help the image of africa .
the western cape possesses the technology and the research that could help them , and there is also a market for us in the wine and fruit industries .
and , will it also have an effect on what the hon premier has just mentioned , the ties between us and china and the economy in that region .
this does not give them the assurance that they can actually invest here , if by our silence we condone what is happening in zimbabwe .
i believe that we as a province must make very sure that in this province there is good governance and good delivery , and that we are as corruption-free as possible .
i would argue , like we have been arguing in the house for years , that the service delivery aspect of the pawc should be addressed , there where the services are truly needed .
hon members will also be aware that for three and a half weeks now there have in fact been no further attacks on any buses .
the former minister of community safety resigned , making a great deal of the fact that he did not have the powers to deal with it .
mr speaker , i want to know whether there were any formal objections raised by governing bodies , parent bodies and community organisations to the closure of any of these 136 schools .
there are some cases , for example , i think it was in slanghoek and a couple of other places in the worcester area , where it was quite difficult to achieve that .
my question is : can the same principle of utilising savings and finances efficiently and maximally not also be considered when it comes to the amalgamation of schools ?
we now await the finalisation of the be legal campaign criteria and draft regulations in terms of the national land transport transition act by the national department of transport .
then again a statement by the former minister of finance and development planning on 16 march 2000 , and i quote from hansard : western cape , vol 3 , p 1372 :
( b ) various meetings were attended by officials of the north west agriculture development centre where inputs have been made with respect to agricultural and development aspects of the project .
i just want to have clarity about this and to ask the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works whether there is anything in the pipeline regarding financial support .
sorry , mr speaker , i have a further point of order : are the replies then also made available to the hon members who asked those questions ?
mr speaker , if one looks at the question one will see that i did not ask if there was any policy or direction .
mr speaker , i cannot answer the question due to the fact that i was not in office when first national bank was awarded the tender .
mr speaker , my answer to the hon member mr byneveldt is that if the intelligence department conveys information to people , i do not ask what it costs .
if one understands the devolution and the budgetary process , this does not mean that the province can now act recklessly in the management of the money .
draft regulations were published in the government gazette for comment on 5 june 2000 , and were responded to by the board and the department of finance on 31 july 2000 .
the cabinet took a resolution on the issue , but a year down the line the ten point plan had still not been implemented by the provincial cabinet .
mr speaker , the current procurement policy that the hon minister referred to is still the old cabinet resolution of 1998 that is being implemented by the provincial government .
] when i gave the undertaking that within five months i would present something to cabinet , i believed that the undertaking could be fulfilled .
( vi ) i am confident that the construction of the convention centre will commence not later than april 2001 and the completion date will be early 2003 .
there are 225 pharmacy posts , of which 137 posts are filled by full-time pharmacists , 26 by sessional pharmacists and 12 by interns ; thus 50 posts are vacant .
in addition , a one level increase for all pharmacists has been recommended from april 2001 , although this still has to be approved by the department of public service and administration .
five centres have already been upgraded in this way and three more will be completed before the end of the year , including the centre in guguletu .
i should like to point out to the questioner , and place on record , that this question does not really apply to transport , but rather to sport and recreation .
i do not wish to go and interfere personally in people 's domestic matters but i shall do the necessary and report back to the hon leader of the opposition .
mr speaker , was no action taken specifically because this person was a white town clerk and because he was a supporter of the da - a supporter of the desperate alliance ?
mr speaker , for the first time in many , many years we have made provision in the budget for top-sliced money specifically for that reason .
it is true that many educators were trained in the first round to give hiv / aids counselling as part of the life skills programme in schools .
on behalf of the cohorts here , i would like to ask the hon premier a question and give him an opportunity to really shine !
mr speaker , if the hon member mr ramatlakane asks me a question like that , he must accept the answer i am going to give him .
messrs d m malatsi and c r redcliffe , accompanied by mr r j king and ms a rossouw , took the oath and took their seats .
i wish also to extend my thanks to the mayor of cape town , mr peter marais , for the work he did as a member of this government .
i have absolute faith that the policies and programmes of this government bear out my commitment , as does the success of our internal transformation 2000 programme .
i appeal to hon members on both sides of the house - let us agree to work together to build the western cape .
in fact , we will approach the unicity and other municipal authorities with a view to fast-tracking the programmes to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hiv / aids .
finally , the provincial government has decided to drive a clean-up campaign aimed at improving the physical environment in which our people live .
i have mentioned our overall education system , but look at our fiscal discipline , minimal corruption , and delivery success in departments such as health , community safety , transport and business promotion , as well as tourism .
and then , mr speaker , i want to include the hon member mr strachan when it comes to " untruths " , if that is the word i must use .
i did not see the hon leader of the opposition at the fire at langa the other day when i took the press and other people there .
mr speaker , let me finish in 30 seconds and basically say that an atmosphere of intimidation has been created which makes a secret ballot absolutely essential .
i hope that we in this house do not have to stand up again and say that sewage spillages have taken place , wherever the community involved might be .
at almost all the schools i visit in poorer communities i have some requests relating to theft , burglaries or vandalism , for added protection from the safe schools programme .
schools will be informed that all cases of vandalism , assault , theft , abuse and any other criminal activity must be reported to the centre as from 1 july 2000 .
we had to go through the whole legal process to get central government policing and the donors , the sponsors , the business people of cape town to do it .
mr speaker , it is obvious that that hon member did not hear what i said - that we do not interfere in any sphere of government .
mr speaker , we come to the issue of the role of the province with regard to local government , which the hon premier has raised here .
i want to point out to the hon premier that there is another department in this province that is dealing with this issue , the department of environmental and cultural affairs .
as recently as 25 january 2000 they were still writing to the local authorities about things that they should have taken up in this regard nine years ago .
mr speaker , does the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism plan , in fact , to develop some policy around it , because we have just heard a contradiction ?
the hon member is not present , and we would request the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism to convey our congratulations to him .
dealings with historic 4x4 users over decades have by their very nature created a challenge for management that cannot be addressed without extensive negotiations and the cooperation of the relevant local authorities .
judging from the way in which they are now responding , however , i am convinced that hon members on that side of the house are no longer constructive , but now destructive .
i must say that he did act when it came to the situation of one firm , i think novell spinners in atlantis .
the largest contract awarded in the current year by the provincial tender board was the new social pension payout system tender to the value of r183 million .
as at 30 september 1999 the total amount of outstanding debt stood at r433 million , of which r180 million was in respect of motor vehicle licences and r118 million for hospital fees .
the second phase of the strategy mentioned above involved the process of defining and prioritising the various departments ' systems required and the it infrastructure to support them .
] if my quick calculations are correct - i think he is about five years older than me - he must be 49 years old today .
madam chairperson , i also wish to thank the department , and more specifically dr stegmann , for recent briefings on the introduction of the new public finance management act .
i therefore assure the hon member mr ramatlakane that there are no winds of change blowing on this side of the house - everything is still on course .
his idea in regard to a free port - i think he has raised it before in this house - is an excellent one , and something that should be considered .
however , madam chairperson , in many respects we are going backwards rapidly , with crime often being the only growth industry along with a loss of jobs .
in times like these we must stop and evaluate where we stand in the struggle and whether we or not are succeeding in achieving our objective .
the western cape police service is therefore understaffed by 20,45 % , based on the fixed establishment , and 45,08 % , based on the ideal personnel strength for the end of 1999 .
hon members will remember that i have already said on numerous occasions that the european standard is 3,6 uniformed officers per 1 000 units of the population .
the moral fibre of society has frayed to such an extent that one has to deal with the causes of crime simultaneously with applying the law .
the size of that giant can be measured , if one takes into account the fact that there are 20 neighbourhood watch members for every police official in the mitchells plain area .
the department is sponsoring the salaries of 20 cpos for a period of six months at a total cost of r404 000 to act specifically as tourist patrol officers .
it was interesting to me to hear the selective selection of statistics from the latest hsrc report which was given by the hon member mr byneveldt in his speech .
madam chairperson , in all fairness to the hon minister and his department , the budget we are talking about today is really incidental to the fight against crime .
mr chairperson , there is appreciation for the 470 community police officers ( cpos ) who will be trained in the next financial year and deployed in the communities .
madam chairperson , secondly nowhere in the lofty statement of the hon minister is any reference made to the redistribution of resources to under-resourced and understaffed police stations .
he said to me , " minister , all that bush needs is a little water and then you will see how beautiful the oudtshoorn area is .
the directorate , as hon members know , is allocating r8 million towards this , spread over two years , so this year we shall be giving r4 million to the project co-ordinators .
this committee will consist of representatives of the wced , ussasa and the department of sport and recreation , together with a few non-government sport organisations that can make a positive contribution .
the draft policy will be widely debated with all stakeholders before it is finalised and it will inform the way forward in the field of school sport .
i am aware that the hon member mr n m isaacs , disabled as he is , is still actively involved in organising sporting activities in his community .
a percentage of those millions of rand that are changing hands need to be diverted and invested in a training programme for the youngsters in order for them to take over from our sporting heroes .
to name one example , a volleyball clinic in the khayelitsha area , organised by the hon minister 's department in the december school holidays , attracted more than 600 children .
in this regard we are faced with the situation that when the coaches are brown or black , the teams are no longer regarded as good enough .
the hon member mr stali referred to aids and asked whether top sportspeople cannot come out and assist in spreading the message as a deterrent .
we are going to use newlands rugby stadium , which has already been adjudicated by the fifa delegation , for one of the round robin venues , as well as perhaps the semi-finals , if we get that far .
i am equally proud of the fact that the western cape provincial government has always been an achiever and continues to be one - notwithstanding similar political storms .
from our side we will be enhancing our provincial communication efforts this year in terms of the com task report which gave rise to the government communication and information system ( gcis ) .
the costs entailed by the project are for the most part carried by the provincial government and the cape metropolitan council , and by contributions by municipalities and district councils in the rural areas .
in the field of technology a bavarian and cape on-line computer project aimed at linking tertiary institutions will be established , as well as an it network with the province .
it says that it was a major relief that the anc was one seat short of a two-thirds majority which would make future changes to the constitution much easier .
there is much we can criticise about africa , but we need to be more constructive about our continent , as i would want us to be about the western cape .
we want to extend the analysis that prof van den bergh did of the wced - and prof bengu did of fort hare - to individual schools .
because poor time management is one of the universal reasons for poor educational output , we wanted to assess the extent to which this is a factor in our poorly performing schools .
mr chairperson , these students must understand that there is no magic about schools anywhere ; their geographical location does not determine their chances of passing .
if students do not pull their weight and apply themselves , they will not get a decent education , whether they are in cape town , bisho or washington .
despite what speakers said here yesterday , reading and writing is more neglected in many of our schools than sport - and that is a fact .
we are preparing a draft bill for further education and training that will be tabled in the legislature during the coming year .
the basic aim is to supply schools with internet connectivity for educational purposes , but the equipment also doubles up as an administrative computer system for the school .
the new equipment and resource material will also require completely new teaching and learning strategies and a massive training programme to ensure that these strategies are implemented properly .
my colleagues and i will strive to do this , but we cannot do it without a radical revision of human resource management policy at the national level .
in the times we are living in , it has become so much more urgent to look after the youth properly , because there are so many things threatening them .
the development of this model followed a thorough inquiry into the effectiveness of , inter alia , the reformatories and industrial schools and places of safety in south africa .
when adoption is more important than implementation , decisions are frequently made without follow-up or the necessary preparation time , and these decisions are usually politically motivated and not educationally motivated .
as i have reported here , i went to one of these so-called consultation processes in constantia , and it was absolutely horrific and mind-boggling .
in my opinion the nearest form of transformation which has come out of the province is the safe schools project , for which we also wish to thank the officials of the wced .
in this regard we would like to take this opportunity to thank the hon minister for her interest in the effective teaching programme of mr john bransby .
i wish to apologise for their absence , but they regard their work as their priority even though they had planned to come to listen to the debate today .
for it to be successful , it should meet the needs of all learners and individual schools should become fully integrated into their communities and be seen as community assets .
the school has produced students who now lecture at the university of stellenbosch in the information technology and business departments , radiologists , chartered accountants and commissioners of the ccma .
in this debate we are having an open discussion , but this issue of curriculum is far too serious for any political party to be scoring brownie points .
i agree with the hon member dr van zyl that this tendency has been far less marked in the western cape than it has been in many other provinces .
i know that i have met her at schools and in different contexts before when we were trying to resolve issues with the help of the community .
] there are objections to the motion being moved without notice and therefore it will appear on the order paper for possible discussion at a later stage .
i was at the tygerberg hospital this morning , and the unfortunate perception was that it is not the best place to go if one is very ill .
moreover , innovative initiatives by specific department heads in these hospitals have resulted in important visual improvements being carried out in specific units and wards involving minimal capital outlay .
we shall soon be appealing to the chambers of commerce to ensure that they too give their workers this bonus by paying for their injections .
disabled people are the most discriminated against and to provide no effective increase in their budget allocation is further to discriminate against them .
this includes giving priority to primary health care , in terms of the 1995 health plan , and reorganising hospital services towards a reduced dependency on academic hospitals .
furthermore , i would like to suggest to the department , regarding the raising of its own revenue , that we need some sort of tabled revenue retention plan .
even during the 1999-2000 financial year , the branch has continued to downsize with a decrease of 1 115 filled posts from 1 february 1999 to 1 february 2000 .
his health deteriorated and the huge backlog at the prosthetic centre at conradie hospital reduced his chances of getting an artificial leg to virtually nil .
there should be a national call-up of health workers who have retired to assist with programmes designed to fight hiv / aids and tuberculosis .
if one goes through the budget , as i have , one finds that there is r50 million , r11 million of which is being used at head office for administration .
one requires the permission of the guardian to do that and one cannot do it until one has carried out proper counselling .
hon members will see that we have not budgeted for the malaria research institute .
it was very quiet in the house last week , but i must say that it is always a pleasure to have the hon member back in the house .
] there are objections to the motion being moved without notice and therefore it will appear on the order paper for possible discussion at a later stage .
if financing is approved - this is also a new concept - a service level agreement or sla is entered into between the department of welfare and its partner / s .
at this stage the revenue for these women is only r200 per month , but with a little patience and the perseverance we have there , it will increase .
i wonder if the anc members of this house are asking for the head of either the current national minister of welfare , or the former minister of welfare , geraldine fraser-moleketi ?
we need to develop policy around aids orphans , and not wait for the disaster to reach our front doors and hope it will disappear .
in fact , all her portfolios should be taken away from her and given to other people to handle , because they are transversal .
there are voices that one hears in the house which hark back to the old days in which there was a grant for every problem that existed .
more important , however , is that i am not only speaking about the virginia petersens , the sharon follentines , the henry de grasses , the wessie van der westhuizens and so forth .
it would be useful to hear from the hon minister how far the case is in terms of the damages being claimed back from denel .
that r76 million is a lot of money for a limited number of institutions , and we are not finding a throughput that says to disadvantaged communities that they are being recognised .
the hon member has encapsulated the essence of the poverty issue that while we are bickering here with one another , millions of south africans - the poorest of the poor - are suffering .
as the hon member will recall , there was at first concern about whether they accepted the action group or another group that was established in that specific area .
such a reduced allocation would have forced the provincial housing development board to stop projects that are already under construction and would have led to incidents of breach of contract from their side .
now that communities are settling in , we are able to implement programmes for capacity building , economic development , early child care , school greening , and the encouraging of improvements to homesteads and gardens .
apart from the promulgation of the western cape housing development act and the appointment of the western cape housing development board , we have also made commendable progress on the majority of our core priorities and key objectives .
madam chairperson , there was an urgent plea for a rapid land release policy that would combat the incidence of land invasion and deal proactively with the increasing demand for housing .
i have also addressed a request to the local authorities to apply , where possible , to utilise their special operational accounts for the establishment of housing .
this mechanism makes provision for the pooling of resources in order to finance the upgrading of living conditions of persons who enjoy functional security of tenure as opposed to legal security of tenure .
however , i want to appeal to all other government departments that also own property in district six to follow the example of the western cape department of housing .
i need to say that there are , indeed , a number of farmers who have taken great strides towards the provision of adequate housing , but they remain the exception rather than the rule .
the chaos which was discovered two years ago , in parliament towers to mention but one example , makes a mockery of the coalition government 's commitment to clean government .
it seems that the hon premier does not want to allow those with whom he has problems to take credit for genuine efforts to benefit the poor .
it is not good enough to tell us that some members of local councils do not want the homeless of other metropolitan local councils .
only two hours ago i had a lady in my office in tears because she cannot see any light at the end of the housing tunnel .
mr chairperson , in closing may i once again commend the hon minister on his budget and on his announcements of delivery that he made here today .
madam chairperson , by means of this amending bill , the poorest of the poor will be able to acquire home ownership before the r7 500 discount subsidy is withdrawn by the national minister of housing .
often it is not just black people who are involved in urbanisation , which is frequently the impression one gets when we talk about urbanisation .
if there are questions that have not been answered , the staff of my department are here and they will follow the questions up and furnish hon members with the answers .
until now provincial interventions have been restricted to section 10g ( 2 ) ( m ) and section 10h ( 6 ) of the local government transition act .
if hon members were to approach a municipality now and ask them what their credit control policy was , many of them would haul out a beautiful book and put it on the table .
if an input comes from the entire district transformation forum or unicity commission , i can see no reason why those inputs cannot be accepted as fact and implemented .
when the hon minister of local government talks in this house about the financial status of local government , he always cites tulbagh , because tulbagh is an anc area .
for a very long time the main function of the provincial department of local government has been the allocation and monitoring of funds transferred to local authorities .
] the lowest form of life is the man who grovels with his nose in the earth and does not realise that there is a world out there .
that is critical , not only regarding transformation in preparation for the 1 november election , but in the future after that .
according to that same hsrc survey , it was found that in the past 12 % of the public were involved in political activities , whether it was local government or ratepayers ' associations .
dp ministers are allowed , and there is not one minister here , to go out and canvass votes , while the new np members have to sit here and maintain a quorum .
look at the development in the metropolitan area for poor people and at where it is actually happening ; then hon members will know that it is in oostenberg .
i could reel off examples for hon members today , from johannesburg to soweto , to the southern cape , to cape town , but is that the solution to our problems ?
however , i cannot , just because a person is a coalition partner or belongs to another party , apply different criteria .
these aforementioned funds are earmarked to promote the compilation of integrated development frameworks in the municipal sphere , including capacity-building and the empowerment of local communities .
the basic points of departure for the regulations were that they should comply with the laws of natural justice , make ample provision for public participation and be easily understood .
since the bulk of the western cape 's coastline is in private ownership , the number of development applications cannot be expected to diminish until every coastal property has been developed .
a conditional national grant in the amount of r1,76 million has been allocated to the western cape for assisting municipalities with the drafting of their idps in the current budget year .
a dire need exists for this assistance , and an increase in the amount is therefore welcomed , so that local authorities can be supported in this crucial executive obligation .
the core business of the pdc is to achieve consensus on development issues among role-players in civil society in order to influence development decision-making and implementation .
however , i acknowledge that behind every minister there is a strong band of loyal officials , and i therefore thank the head of department , john africa , for his valued leadership and guidance .
this argument is further supported by a constitutional proviso in part a of the constitution of the republic of south africa , 1996 , whereby provincial planning is a schedule 5 function .
they produced a very informative booklet , but were not even given a chance by the hon minister of finance and development planning to present it .
however , the policy only went to a cabinet committee - not even the full cabinet - last week , and it has yet to be published for public comment .
the third area is known as the transition zone , which is the least ecologically sensitive area where a great variety of land uses occur , such as farming , commercial plantations and towns .
mr chairperson , just over a year ago i was part of a council decision after direction from this province to have a home demolished .
might i just add to what the hon member mr ozinsky has said , by saying to him that it definitely was not a full cabinet decision .
the hon minister , of course , was wise enough to pre-empt this particular input by highlighting the matter himself in his speech today .
there must be a human resource development programme in place that will assist them , so that they do not become window-dressing in a department , just to change the statistics .
when one looks at all these things , i sometimes think that this is unaffordable and that they need too much money to expedite the process .
this unit will also make proposals to the national ministry of environmental affairs and tourism to access additional funding for solid waste management , refuse removal and pollution control projects .
as people move to the cities and standards of living rise , urban consumption will continue to increase , bringing into sharp focus our waste management strategies .
the demands on this unit have grown exponentially , to the extent that we have allocated an amount of r3,4 million ; an increase of 70 % .
the western cape cultural commission will administer r10,146 million of our budget on applications made by the different organisations involved in the various cultural activities .
it remains the area in which we can penetrate deepest into the cultural life of all the communities , rural and urban , and where we can , through cultural affairs , bring about community upliftment .
madam chairperson , in listening to the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs it again struck me what an important role language plays in our community .
to enable the western cape language committee to fulfil its important task , an amount of r603 000 has been set aside as transfer payments in the coming financial year .
can we afford the performing arts , if we look at other pressing issues such as the lack of housing , rising crime statistics and health issues , to name but a few ?
cultural services is facing new challenges in striving to optimise the limited resources at their disposal for the maximum benefit to the community they serve .
we are going to hand that process over to the very people who draw up the environmental impact assessments and advise developers on ways to get around the procedure and the law .
it remains the area in which we can penetrate the deepest into the cultural life of all the communities , rural and urban , and where we can , through cultural affairs bring about community upliftment .
i am pleased to mention that the committee in the department of environmental and cultural affairs has looked at various issues concerning hiv / aids .
cultural deprivation can be responsible for the rise in low-income families , violence and abuse ; the results of the tot system ; and the high rate of tb in our province .
as recently as last week , lamberts bay , saldanha bay and hout bay had to close their slipways , because nothing is being done to upgrade the harbours in this province .
they referred four to five times in their speeches to things in their constituencies and asked the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs to help them with those things .
today i am speaking about the voters of hermanus , and specifically the dispute about the closing of the thoroughfare to " die plaat " via the mouth of the klein river lagoon .
yes , i agree , but i think the hon minister did acknowledge a mistake when he said that he was taking the matter on review .
mr speaker , on a point of order : i wish to draw your attention to the fact that the level of noise in the house cannot be permitted in terms of the rules .
this will achieve little , if anything , in reducing the staggering backlog of road rehabilitation , currently standing at r700 million to meet minimum standards only .
as regards the maintenance of roads the amount of r193,4 million has been allocated for maintenance for the 2000-01 financial year to make up the enormous backlog in the province 's road network .
accordingly , for a period of two years 27 labourers were employed every month and this contributed approximately r40 000 per month to the local economy .
pedestrian fatalities in the western cape represent more than 48 % of the total road fatalities in the province which is , in comparison with the 38 % nationally , very high .
i am pleased to see that there is a great emphasis on youth training , and also that there are bursaries for technical and mechanical engineers in transport .
to maintain our buildings we need to look at creating more maintenance funds by selling buildings and putting the money into a capital fund .
it must be noted that the previously privileged class and their supporters have learned the rhetoric - they speak glibly about how to deal with poverty .
all the white afrikaners that participated in the national public works programme of the 1920s and 1930s and remember the problems of that time can bear testimony to this .
the last term saw about 101 public works-related projects undertaken , which created assets , empowered the community and created many jobs .
over the last 22 years elsewhere in africa over 20 000 km of road have been constructed and maintained by highly labour-intensive construction methods , which have generated thousands of years of employment .
this emerged very clearly in the budget address of the hon minister of transport and works , that the point is made in regard to the development framework .
] it is one of the objectives that forms part of the key functions of the department of transport to improve the road network , particularly to the poorer communities .
has the time not come for us to contract out the regravelling of roads as well as tarring projects so that these projects can in future be carried out on business principles to a greater extent ?
since 1996 , with reference to the statistics at my disposal , the budget for the regravelling of roads is cut every year , and the backlogs are building up every year .
we need to take heed of what is happening , with car owners being loaded with all these increases , and their also facing a toll-road fee .
moreover , as the hon minister knows , during my speeches i highlight problems that i hope he will deal with , and normally these are raised in a constructive manner .
i listened to him making his speech , and i also read it - of course , the section on works , my favourite topic , is in afrikaans !
i want to thank the hon member mr louis , the chairperson of the standing committee on economic development , for his contribution and for the congratulations he conveyed .
this year we are going to place several pieces of legislation on the table that we also gave to hon members and to which i referred in my budget speech .
accordingly we decided that we would share the floor ; for the sake of the money of the province and the administration we are happy to share the floor .
as far as road fatalities are concerned , we have had a decrease of 37 % in road fatalities over the last festive season and i think we are making progress .
] there are objections to the motion being moved without notice and accordingly it will be placed on the order paper for possible discussion on a later occasion .
if there is any lack of clarity about the content of a motion , the secretariat never interferes with the content without consulting the proposer .
my speech today will be in the nature of a progress report on that statement and hon members are requested to consider the one as following upon the other .
i would like anecdotally to refer hon members to what is probably the most significant transaction in this regard , namely the take-over of time-warner by america online .
in january this year aol took over time-warner and at that point the 10 % share in aol was worth not $ 5 million , but $ 15 billion .
the degree of integration of an economy into the global economy influences the impact of that knowledge economy on the local economy , and south africa is steeply integrated into the global economy .
the primary focus of such an agency would be to market the tourism products of our province in terms of themes and routes and for the province as a whole .
i am of the view that the administration of the liquor board is underresourced and the department has initiated a work study to address this matter .
during 1999 the board considered 1 565 applications ; it approved 824 applications and refused 146 , while 595 applications received in 1999 are still being processed .
maybe the hon member mr strachan will be known as " mr policy " as well , in the sense that he always says , " but where is the policy ?
i want to tell the hon minister and the department that we need to tap into the economic vision of preparing the cape for the knowledge economy .
the way in which business promotion can be marketed in future together with the popularity of the western cape as a tourist destination is gratifying and can only have the greatest benefit for the western cape .
although the western cape government - and the national government - are not per se manufacturers and cannot be so , they are the creator of the climate , and must always be that .
the biggest single category of economically active people , 18,5 % , are in the survivalist sector , and the key sectors for labour absorption are tourism , agriculture , manufacturing , construction and a variety of services .
the banking sector , notwithstanding the fact that khula is providing underwriting , is redlining black african and coloured entrepreneurs - i have a pile of them on my desk .
i say this in the context of the abuses that surround many illegal taverns and shebeens and , i might add , there are also legalised taverns where these abuses are taking place .
madam chairperson , it is quite unnerving to speak after such scathing criticism of the hon minister by the hon member mr winde .
the hon member from the karoo , mr gelderblom , referred to the enormous natural assets we have and also other factors that could contribute towards this growth .
one of the functions of local tourism bureaux is determining local marketing policy and strategy , and that includes the development of local marketing material .
we will critically - of course , the hon minister can rely on us - engage the ministry when we feel that it is falling short on certain aspects .
i could perhaps make a controversial point and say that at the start of the 21st century the western cape is blessed in not having mineral wealth .
] if hon members want to talk about economic disempowerment , i want to tell them that the anc has become the greatest contributing factor to disempowerment in this country .
if there is any opportunity for there to be a conflict of interest on an issue which is being discussed by any of the members of the board , they should recuse themselves .
in september 1999 i announced that the chief directorate : agriculture had identified four key focus areas for the next five years , in line with the key objectives of the western cape government .
in the european union agriculture provides employment to 5 % of the population , but it enjoys the benefit of almost half of the budget of the european union .
in the fight against rabies , we provide free vaccines to more than 30 000 cats and dogs through animal welfare associations in rural areas and informal settlements .
in addition , we have allocated funds to sensitise our people in informal settlements to the danger of diseases transmittable by contaminated animals and their products .
secondly , i would like to support the hon minister in calling on president mbeki to make a public statement on the illegal possession of land in zimbabwe .
there are approximately 8 747 farming units in the western cape , and 1 500 farmers from previously disadvantaged communities , bringing the total to 10 200 farmers in the western cape .
that is why we cannot help but say it is very difficult for us to support a low budget of r74 million .
according to the white paper of the national department of agriculture that was issued in 1995 , the key challenge is to establish a single equal agricultural sector out of two historic societies .
however , i wish to give an assurance to organisations such as the african farmers ' union , the small-scale farmers ' associations and the ngos that the anc will not allow this to go by unnoticed .
as regards the trends in the budget itself , the subprogramme , rural development and training has been cut by something like 58 % from the 1999-2000 budget to the 2000-01 budget .
i am very grateful for the concession to the marine industry , but that helps very little when the boat is able to obtain fuel and the fishermen have no quotas .
to crown it all , janneman sometimes gets a tot of liquor from his employer by way of remuneration , and he is difficult when he has had something to drink .
i wish to quote from the unifruco study of 1995 , more specifically the report entitled , farm workers in the western cape , of september 1997 , pages 17 and 18 .
the farm worker population of the western cape is chronically malnourished , and this despite the fact that the poorest households spend a large proportion of their income on food .
madam chairperson , hon members must bear in mind that if it is difficult for commercial farmers to make a living , how much more difficult will it be for new farmers ?
the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation was required to come back to the standing committee with an answer on the legality of provinces paying the salaries of community police officers .
madam chairperson , in some instances the anc does not want to object to a particular vote , but what is necessary is further information on a particular issue .
however , if the hon member wants to move an amendment and liaise with the leader of the house over the floor for this , i will allow it .
] there are objections to the motion being moved without notice and therefore it will have to appear on the order paper for possible discussion at a later date .

i am equally proud of the fact that the western cape provincial government has always been an achiever and continues to be one - notwithstanding similar political storms .
from our side we will be enhancing our provincial communication efforts this year in terms of the com task report which gave rise to the government communication and information system ( gcis ) .
the costs entailed by the project are for the most part carried by the provincial government and the cape metropolitan council , and by contributions by municipalities and district councils in the rural areas .
in the field of technology a bavarian and cape on-line computer project aimed at linking tertiary institutions will be established , as well as an it network with the province .
it says that it was a major relief that the anc was one seat short of a two-thirds majority which would make future changes to the constitution much easier .
there is much we can criticise about africa , but we need to be more constructive about our continent , as i would want us to be about the western cape .
that the provincial government be requested to render the necessary financial support to the relevant cultural groups dedicated to the burial of saartjie baartman in south africa .

if an hon member does not indicate to the chair specifically that the motion is being moved without notice , the chair has to regard it as a notice of motion .
in the areas of mossel bay and knysna there was not only conflict between taxis , but also along the border between the western cape and eastern cape .
on 21 february this year , a dossier on operators was handed to the hon minister of transport and works and he agreed to sort out the problems .
it is gratifying to hear that the national minister of transport supported the hon minister of transport and works in a letter relating to this amendment bill .
the questions which need to be answered are these . kwazulu-natal and gauteng are always referred to by leaders of the coalition as provinces that do not have their act together , and that cannot govern .
every political persuasion in the house will agree that it is wrong to deny anybody else the right to apply for business in the area .
mr speaker , the bill provides that when a situation of violence , unrest , conflict or instability arises , such an area may be declared as being closed to operators .
i want to make it clear that without first monitoring the situation on the ground the proposed act is simply a tool in the hand of the minister .
the udm has the same rights as any of the other political parties in the house , and if there are people who have problems with that , that is their affair .
he rather serves the interests of a handful of white voters , than deal with crime on the cape flats - that is what the hon the minister and the coalition say .
mr speaker , the solution is indeed that it must be seen to that justice - and justice is what the hon member mr marais also spoke about - triumphs .
violence and violence-related incidents are a sign of our increasingly sick society in which moral and ethical values and norms are being placed under tremendous pressure .
mr speaker , i want to ask the hon member mr byneveldt whether he agrees that we as a house should devise steps to address the crime situation .
is that coincidental , or is it characteristic of the violent character of this " non-person " as marike de klerk classified brown people at an np tea party once ?
] it is an absolute tragedy for the country , but it is a double tragedy because the hon members on that side of the house are misusing it .
mr speaker , the fact of the matter is that at the moment south africa - and i am not blackening the country 's name - is passing through a tremendous process of transformation .
if the government is not prepared to do that , the only other option is to double-tax the people and bring about municipal policing .
do hon members know that at the moment the khayelitsha police station is the only police station in the province , with the exception of the guguletu police station , that is 12 % over strength ?
] there are objections to the motion being moved without notice and therefore it will appear on the order paper for possible discussion at a later date .
at the end of the day the legal opinion showed that our treasury was wrong and that the province was indeed authorised to incur that expenditure .
the hon premier goes on to criticise our president , mr thabo mbeki , and say that there is a contradiction , he does not practise what he preaches .
moreover , in an amazing way , just like an amoeba , a political amoeba , the hon member mr silke in his wonderful jelly bean fashion , voted with the new np !
mr speaker , the hon premier promised his new np congress in september 1999 that he would address the problem of his loss in the election polls .
i am glad to support this as it comes before us in the bill as it stands at the moment , and we therefore support the bill .
before i respond to this i want to answer a question that was asked earlier , namely why the chairperson of the standing committee on public accounts said nothing .
the public service , the director-general and the government had from 16 november 1998 up until march 1999 to mobilise public servants , and they did not take that opportunity .
] it is a well-known fact that the officials lower down in the ranks did not wish to participate and work without compensation .
] and when we registered voters , we did not register people on the basis of - and i repeat this - who they were going to vote for .
then dealing with the subprogramme or any other programme , i am not able to tell hon members from what specific programme the amount of r707,82 came .
madam chairperson , in preparation for this particular finance act , the hon minister managed at least to get details about it , knowing that we were going to come to this .
i am surprised that he locates the savings in pensions and grants because that is a statutory amount - what it was voted for it must be used for .
what sections of the health services were they from , were any of them from emergency services and where were they going to be deployed to as part of the integrated iec process ?
that is why i assume that when we deal with the budget we will be very supportive of that amount of money , but now the hon minister can actually save r35 000 .
" life within a global and national transition is so filled with fluctuations that that which he blamed yesterday , he claims today and vice versa .
the challenge to the leadership of the anc is to show that they have also moved on and that they are not stuck in the 20th century .
the hon premier spoke about the commitment of the government to creating job opportunities , speeding up delivery and a better quality of life for all the people of the western cape .
when i go to elsies river , manenberg , bishop lavis or dysselsdorp , i have to repeat what was said six years ago and last year as well : the plan is still coming .
mr speaker , permit me to add my voice to those who have congratulated the hon premier on the celebration of his 60th birthday .
the circumstances of these two pupils was strikingly described by jorisna bonthuys yesterday in die burger under the heading , " many children are fighting a lone battle for survival in the new school year " .
people remember that it was the anc-run local governments in plettenberg bay , worcester , riversdale , tygerberg and george that have won awards for housing delivery , sound financial management and the masakhane campaign .
we need a specific programme to ensure that the historically disadvantaged actually benefit from the realisation of the priorities that the hon premier has outlined .
they have nowhere to go to have these issues dealt with because there is no tribunal to deal with these matters .
i want to pay tribute to those principals and circuit managers who stood firm to implement our time on task policies , often against tremendous pressure from the anc .
the hon premier must tell us how the da 's negative and destructive campaign abroad will strengthen cooperative government and bring investment to this country .
there is no industry in the mitchells plain-khayelitsha area , there are therefore no jobs , and there is no prospect of creating a better life .
the national government has decreased state maintenance grants , but we have a moral obligation to reach all the children in the city and in this province who are poor .
this meant that women who were receiving less money would be empowered by putting their money together and starting bigger income-generation projects .
the high incidence of assaults , racism , evictions and exploitation of unskilled farm workers is offensive to the anc in its endeavour to achieve a democratic non-racial south africa .
if the loss had been purely financial , that would have been one thing , but these losses have resulted in 1 500 fewer job opportunities in the formal and informal agricultural sectors of the western cape .
last week he appealed for a partnership among the police , the government , the business sector and agricultural producers to combat the evil of farm murders and attacks .
i call upon the anc leaders to take the honourable way and tell the people out there that they are sorry .
mr speaker , i would also like to congratulate the hon premier on his opening address yesterday and also for being nominated the best premier for the year .
mr speaker , there is no conceivable foreign military threat to south africa , yet the national government embarked upon a r43 billion rearmament programme .
the initial deal was for r21 billion , it quietly became r30 billion and in an article i read recently it is re-estimated at r48 billion .
instead , the president and the national minister of health wasted precious time and are responsible for the deadly confusion which now dominates the townships .
i am convinced that we can rely on him to execute the commitment of the province to provide antiretrovirals preventatively for victims of rape .
at this stage it is likely that a second drug will be added to azt , giving a 90 % efficacy , instead of the current 50 % .
like any other product , some generic medicines are better than others , and particularly in cases where the patent rights fell away long ago , generic remedies will of course be cheaper .
the message that developers and manufacturers are trying to convey to the consumers is that copyright is their lawful property just like any other lawful property such as land or mineral rights .
countries which in the past did not devote much attention to the value of intellectual property are currently returning to such recognition , one by one .
the committee notes with concern the r10 million shifted funds allocated for poverty relief in the office of the premier , director-general and corporate services .
we were told - together with the then minister of social services , mr peter marais - that they would work out how the money would be spent .
madam chairperson , could the hon minister describe the criteria and framework used to determine which organisations receive funding under programme 3 : developmental social service delivery ?

however , if he links it to bloodshed , deaths and so on , he must be very careful about pointing a finger at specific hon members in the house .
i think the hon minister agrees with the sentiment which has been discussed with him before , that this matter needs urgent attention , attention now .
mr speaker , we in the anc are prepared and we will continue to be prepared to be part of the process that the hon minister has set up .
depending where they come from - and how many transport changes they have to make - it can cost as much per day by taxi as it costs per week on a bus .
the standing committee that deals with transport could have played an important supportive and facilitating role in the resolution of the situation of taxi violence , and it was not used .
i said that the formalisation process would be finished by the end of december 1999 , and i am saying here now that the formalisation process is finished as far as i am concerned .
i want people who are independent members of the public , who can deal with applications in a straightforward manner , rather than bringing in a member .
i told him that i was prepared to go as far as i could to talk to the representatives of the taxi and bus companies .
] that is not how we are going to solve the problem , because then we shall be making the transport problem a political problem .
( 4 ) the department of transport and works immediately intervenes to restore and replace the necessary infrastructure with regard to toilets and washing facilities at pma .
] there are objections and therefore it will appear on the order paper for possible discussion at a later date .
these things are planned at least three to six years ahead and that is why it is very important that our time lines are accurate in its construction .
although the convention centre will be equipped with state-of-the-art video and internet conferencing facilities , the main value , of course , is personal networking and contacts in the selling of meetings and exhibitions .
sir , we know that there is grave concern among the members of the anc because they wanted us to discuss the agreements together with the bill .
the fact is that it is inseparable from the legislation before us , despite the hon minister 's protestations to the contrary .
we do not believe that those concerns on the part of the auditor-general have been eliminated by the inputs made by the hon minister or the legal team there .
for this reason , and the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism has already alluded to it , the australian example in establishing a convention centre industry is most relevant .
for cape town economic development and tourism growth are intrinsically linked and the passing of this bill is an historic milestone in the history of the province .
any lawyer can take this document to court and say there is no such legal entity as the " government of the western province " .

when the hon member mr fransman stood before the prison at malmesbury , statements were made against the judiciary because a member of that party had been found guilty .
eminent lawyers have pointed out numerous cases which reveal deep-seated racial and political bias in the judgments , and especially the sentencing patterns , of the apartheid era judiciary .
mr speaker , we are discussing the motion before the house against the background of having a constitutional state in south africa and a totally transformed , better judicial system .
mr speaker , the second africa competitives report was released earlier this week to coincide with the world economic forum meeting in durban .
there is a perception abroad that stability and respect for democracy is weaker than it was two years ago , and that includes respect for the judiciary .
one of the greatest challenges in establishing a true democracy in the new south africa is the establishment of a credible , independent judiciary in the country .
mr speaker , in joining in the debate today , i would like the house to consider the importance of the judicial system in nation building .
let us put aside our political differences and have a fundamental discussion , in order to assist ordinary people on the ground to have faith and confidence in this institution .
mr speaker , is it also not ironical that members of the new np and the dp now want to acclaim mr chief justice mahomed after his death ?
the two basic reasons why we joined the np were to save this country and to give the coloured people a place under the sun .
they do not get access to finance , and the basis for the rejections of many of the applications is the fact that they do not have collateral .
because black businesses still have to go through the normal banking checks - their risk aversion checks , their business checks , their credibility checks , all of that - before they can get finance from khula funding .
another bottleneck is risk aversion by institutional investors who are inclined to focus on safer and bigger investments that entail less social and economic benefits for south africa .
a serious commitment to cutting the indomitable red tape that continues to tie up smmes must be moved to the top of the government 's priority list .
what we are finding is that this is a rolling action that we have to take in an orderly way , firstly , to flush out the complaints and allegations .
the mitchells plain industrial development trust is trying to set up a development where essentially they want to construct a 70 % retail and 30 % industrial complex in mitchells plain .
it is because at the national government level and within the anc there is a complete lack of direction at the moment on where they should go with smme development .
] linked to that is the fact that smme development , not only in south africa but in every single country of the world , is one of the biggest economic problems .
if they can get past their prejudice against the so-called white party , they may just have it in their hearts to actually say , " well done !

our present councillors have inherited sufficient inequities in the distribution of rates payable , and the primary reason for this was the inheritance of an outdated voters ' roll .
the people of grassy park always complained - and the facts prove it - that they were paying higher rates than the people living in constantia .
the provincial and central governments have devolved and sometimes dumped functions onto local government without giving it the money to carry out the functions .
in addition , it is unacceptable that the draft bill gives sweeping powers to the minister of local and provincial government to make regulations on property rating .
it got onto the internet after it had of course leaked from the offices of the anc and certain people placed it on the internet .
certain areas can be phased in over a period of six years , but then there are other specific areas which can be phased in over a period of three years .
in that case our system of credit control would collapse entirely because whose water would one cut off , whose electricity would be switched off and what services would be stopped ?
one simply cannot deny that there must be a policy of compassion and that people who are unable to afford this must be looked after .
madam speaker , unfortunately the research into the nature of the farm attacks has been complicated by the lack of a proper , reliable database containing information pertaining to this phenomenon .
the answer to this threat will have to be found in increasing security consciousness among all potential victims and closer cooperation amongst all concerned , including the security forces .
report 5 on page 102 of the report of the standing committee on public accounts , 1998 ( announcements , tablings and committee reports no. 30-1998 , dated 1 december 1998 )
the committee wishes to express its concern that the special needs chapter , especially in terms of high priority areas and their outcomes , was considered an add-on by departments .
that before the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling recommends any further personnel expenditure in terms of special needs , a full personnel management plan and framework is presented to it .

mr speaker , we expect to have three casinos in the western cape that will be open to the public before the end of this year .
mr speaker , one is inclined sometimes only to dwell on features of gambling which are perceived to be to the benefit of the province .
i would like to thank the hon members that took part in the debate and also the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling for dealing with the matter .
countless buildings , including a huge shopping centre in sun valley , began construction without their plans being approved and procedures of consultation followed .
the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs and the former minister of community safety , sport and recreation , who is no longer with us , were part of the task team .
i think we worked in a very constructive way when dealing with the issues , and we also interviewed numerous key role-players in this matter .
mr speaker , mr guy dormehl , another chairperson of one of the civic associations , said in a letter to the cape times , and i quote :
these trends have increased in occurrence and they have an effect and also undermine the procedures of inspection on site and create problems in complying with regulations .
is this why the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism misled the public by stating that the cape town city council had not raised the issue ?
the hon minister of social services thinks that black people can all become wealthy overnight and therefore he strongly opposes some black people becoming wealthy through empowerment .
what we now have to deal with is a situation in which that inconsistency is starting to disqualify the dp from any attempt to expose corruption in this country .
i venture to suggest that by the hon premier being a party to my being appointed as a director , he ipso facto made that decision .

it was only last year when the hon leader of the opposition , my party leader in the western cape , was not permitted to speak at a local mosque .
the safety of the hon leader of the opposition , the safety of the hon premier and the safety of all of us in the province is not negotiable to us .
if anyone believes that this country treats muslims differently , let alone unfairly , then consider the two contrasting judgments issued yesterday by our judiciary .
in addition , the police leadership advised me today that they would deploy additional specialised protection officers in the western cape to deal with the threat against , especially , public officials .
forgetting the role a specific group of people such as the griqua have played and still play in this country also constitutes an act of racism .
we agree that incidents of racism should be exposed and that south africans should actively strive to achieve the alternative - a non-racial open society .
if we played the despicable game of race-baiting , can one imagine what cynical use we could have made of the tragic fairhead murders in the eastern cape ?
even after the employment equity act , 1998 ( act 55 of 1998 ) , was promulgated , there was no purposeful effort to attempt to rectify this skewed graph .
often , even though a person is in possession of the anc membership card but does not move in a certain group , he / she does not see the light either .
today we must argue that such an exclusive focus on african and coloured experiences of race and racism is not only unhelpful but even morally wrong .
no wonder president mbeki speaks about the two nations , because the gini coefficient speaks of a largely affluent white community and a largely poor black community .
i want to say here that i was a young man who went to the sadf , and who was sent into angola and the townships to do the work .

mr speaker , i would have expected that reasonable opportunity be given in standing committee meetings to people to avail themselves of certain facts and figures .
they made a mockery of democracy and transparency , because in the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling they would allow no discussion of the issue .
it is not parliamentary to refer to another member as a scoundrel , but the hon member mr strachan did not do that .
mr speaker , the adjustments estimate is tabled today to seek the approval of this parliament , in terms of the western cape exchequer law , of certain adjustments to the 1999-2000 budget .
the next heading is the reappropriation of money which was appropriated by the provincial parliament in the preceding financial year , but was not spent - the so-called roll-over funds .
it is absolutely true that the national minister of education went around , looked at the schools and virtually promised the rebuilding of the schools .
while there are never such an item on the order paper , it is only at the opening of parliament that the speaker does not refer to that at all .
mr speaker , i want to join the house in congratulating the hon premier on his 60th birthday and wishing him many more years to come .
in a recent incident in paarl , rosie manus and joseph willie were beaten by a farmer on groot simonsvlei farm when their car broke down .
mr speaker , the hon premier should accompany the hon minister of education to luxolo primary school to see the bad conditions which those people experience daily .

when ian iversen was enjoying the fruits of apartheid , there were many blacks and some whites who were paying with their lives in the struggle against apartheid .
i believe it is also necessary for me to say something about the remarks made by the hon member mr louis concerning casinos .
whilst on this subject i wish to thank the hon premier for the announcement in regard to the establishment of a western cape interest office in the european community .
they are the ones who are recognising not only the inability of the anc to deliver , but also the arrogance of the power-virus that has infected that organisation .
these voters now realise that after seven years in power the only delivery the anc can make is to their own party cronies and apparatchiks .
mr speaker , yesterday two hon members of the ruling party , and quite a few today , gave the impression that the da had won the national elections .
mr speaker , visitors to this country came looking for the poor young man who had been in exile for the cause of the struggle .
sir , i want to ask the hon leader of the opposition why he thinks we planted a couple of our stalwart nationalists among them .
mr speaker , the article tells us one thing very clearly , and that is that the anc in the province does not have much of a future .
mutual respect with the press and opposition parties , with each accepting the other 's bona fides and the different roles they have to play in our society .
the da will never be able to condone these actions , because the party was born out of true democratic principles based on total transparency and freedom of speech .
as soon as one mentions a word which refers to colour one is a racist , without looking at the content or the meaning of what is being said .
or is he going to continue like the hon member mr isaacs , who continues to insult people who gave up their lives and their privileges to fight apartheid ?
mr speaker , the cultural commission would similarly be required to produce tangible and visible results in the experiences of people and in the arts .
i do not want to be misunderstood , but the people who perpetrated those crimes - the violence and these unfortunate deaths - must be brought to justice .
mr speaker , i wish to respond to the speeches of the hon members messrs strachan and ozinsky , who spoke about the soccer at newlands , among other things .
the recent local election proved that the people of the western cape trust the hon premier and his government with the host of issues that have to be addressed .
they have utterly disillusioned the people , and their campaign to win votes will therefore be largely fruitless , in spite of the bosberaad at citrusdal .
less than 10 % of south africans participate in the formal sport set-up and it is my department 's goal to increase the number of persons playing sport .
over the past week we again saw how government supporters from the leafy suburb of newlands vented their racial spleen on football supporters from the townships .
these children find themselves involved in criminal activities because of the dearth of sporting and recreational facilities , and because the children have nothing to do after school .
more than 50 % of all the municipalities in the western cape , and there are 25 of them , became hung councils .
] more interesting , at the cederberg municipality there was one udm councillor who , up to december , was in arrears at the municipality by approximately r7 000 , and he was unemployed .
i want the hon leader of the opposition to look at what his people are doing and whether their dealings show them to be truly serious .
after all , mr speaker , the anc had a message of hope and transformation for the elections and not one of doom and gloom .
i think it is important for us today to ponder this for a moment and see how we can build that cooperation in south africa , and in the western cape in particular .
regardless of whether we are talking about cape town or the western cape , we are part of south africa , and it is very clear that we want to remain part of south africa .
hon members on that side of the house made a lot of fuss about the western cape allegedly regarding itself as an island , separate from the rest of south africa .
the western cape government will be executing a carefully planned , direct assault on gangsterism and the causes of gangsterism in the areas that are most affected by gangs ; and
the anc will advise karin reed that in terms of the new laws on access to information , she has the right to appeal to see everything in her file .
if education decisions are not educationally justifiable , but taken for the sake of keeping within the education budget , the standing committee will , unfortunately , not be able to support them .
by way of electronic mail and bulletin boards the citizens of the western cape will be given the opportunity to participate in the policy formulation and legislative processes .
other organs of state , through legislative and other measures , must assist and protect these institutions to ensure the independence , impartiality , dignity and effectiveness of these institutions .
even if the hon member mr ozinsky puts specific views , the issue will have to be corrected in a debate , and not by way of a point of order .
before that hon member ever dreamt of going to the dp , the hon minister had discussions with the hon minister of health and me .
the hon premier must remember that he is addressing the people of the western cape , not a group of tourists and investors who still seek fortune in this province .
what is required is a service staffed by serious professionals , detectives who immerse themselves in the daily politics of the communities they police .
the r1 million was not for registration , but for the disaster fund that was established out of the budget of the hon minister in the office of the premier .
they create , furthermore , the opportunity for individuals who did not have privileges before to have a share now in the opportunities at their disposal .
] they are now looking for an alliance with the new np . the hon member mr dugmore is looking for an alliance with the new np at the expense of the dp .
i was standing in the shop and the shopkeeper was about to take my money , when he turned to attend to the white gentleman .
it was a sunday morning and it had been a very beautiful drive down to swellendam , i was very calm and i let him attend to the white gentleman .
the president said in his speech on 8 january this year that one of the solutions to poverty is dealing with the issues of racism and sexism .
mr speaker , i would like to remind the house that when people are sleeping , they dream , and when they wake up they realise that they have only been dreaming .
as hon members know , commissioner max is the first - for want of a better word - person of colour who became a provincial commissioner in this province .
what is not helping , though , is the fact that despite the shortages and the constraints , the national government has again issued notices of voluntary severance packages .
if the anc really cares about people who are less privileged , how do they explain the mass of people now sitting at home without food ?
against that background , this year 's budget was clearly not a realistic allocation and recognition of this fact is reflected in the increase in next year 's mtef allocation .
furthermore , we must take heed of warnings that the constitution will have to be amended in order to empower the provinces and communities to combat crime in their own areas .
yes , and the tune accompanying his pomp and splendour was a rendition of racism and poverty by the poor from the rural areas and the metro .
] mr baadjies ' face became swollen , his lip was torn , and i would assume that at that moment his faith and hope in a new south africa were shattered .
madam speaker , on a point of order : the hon gentleman has just misled the house by saying that i have officials in the saps ...
madam speaker , on a point of order : the hon member mr fransman is now the umpteenth speaker on that side of the house to make the same mistake .
] it is true when they say that we should now stop making laws about them and , for a change , do something positive to improve their conditions .
madam speaker , i want to distance myself from what my friend on the other side of the house said , when he placed a dog above farm workers .
madam speaker , at the moment it is the case that as a result of the land reform programme farm workers who have been living on a farm for 20 years are deprived of the r16 000 subsidies .
on 20 july 1999 , this province 's government wrote a letter to president mbeki in which we requested him to declare a drought disaster area in the southern cape .
madam speaker , i want to tell the hon member mr king that i am sorry that the discrimination in relation to my time did not succeed .
the hon premier made a desperate coalition-tailored speech , with controversial suggestions about finance , including the director-general 's letter that was quoted extensively .
not one of the four newspapers that have appeared since they criticised me for incompetence yesterday has seen fit to print anything in this regard .
these principles informed the previous mtef allocations from the 1999-2000 financial year up to the 2001-02 financial year and were thus the departure points leading into the present budget process .
mr speaker , given the policy goals adopted by the newly formed provincial cabinet , the emphasis has shifted from the previous allocative framework to the attainment of specific service delivery objectives .
this year 's budget is presented within a macroeconomic context which , while it shows many encouraging signs on the national level , continues to confront the provinces with a multitude of challenges .
during the 1998-99 period , the unemployment level in the western cape increased by about 10 000 persons to 307 300 , or some 18,4 % of the province 's labour supply .
in the 2000-01 estimate of revenue , more than 95 % of provincial revenues come from the combination of equitable share allocations and conditional grants from national departments .
the province has never had a bank overdraft , and it is projected that there will be a budget surplus in the 2000-01 financial year and the two subsequent years .
the department , under the policy direction of the hon minister of health , must redeploy current services within the affordable envelope , national policy guidelines and particularly conventions that might be applicable .
at this stage i pause to draw attention to the figures involved , so that the house will know exactly which will be dealt with in the adjustments estimate .
] there are also certain smaller deductions which i have here such as land affairs and welfare , but as i said these matters will be dealt with in the adjustments estimate .
the revenue for the health vote was adjusted downwards , from original estimates , by r9 million per year over the mtef years in line with the current downward trend .
according to the latest available household survey 16,6 % of households in this province earn less than r1 000 per month , whilst nationally this figure is over 40 % .
i am indeed fortunate to deal with our own western cape team finance , which is led by an outstanding public servant in the person of dr j c stegmann .
a special investigation of the management measures and financial control at the department of trade , industry and tourism of the western cape provincial administration [ pr 22 / 1999 ] .
buffer zones should also be provided for , in case of overlaps , to prevent costly wasted man-hours by officials waiting to deliver evidence .
one of the primary objectives is to create a macroeconomic framework and to guarantee effective macroeconomic management in order to improve the long-term performance of the economy .
other departments and ministers - and here i would like to single out the hon minister in the office of the premier - did not get anywhere in that process .
are we not relieving poverty when we provide primary health care to our desperately poor rural communities spread from joe slovo park in vredendal north to new horizons ?
it is the result of lazy officials , appointed by the anc , who care more for their own comfort than for the welfare of the poor .
provide for the exercise of control over marine living resources in a fair and equitable manner to the benefit of all the citizens of south africa ; ...
the hon leader of the opposition and every hon member on that side of the house who has risen to speak this year , have used the same cynical tactic .
however , it is an incontrovertible fact that as far as the generation of funds is concerned , provinces still have the short end of the stick as far as the centralisation policy of the anc central government is concerned .
the overall budget must still be seen against the background that up to the present , finality has not yet been obtained as to the problems relating to the strange census statistics .
we have repeatedly stated very clearly , through our national leader and provincial leader , that for this side of the house the era of apartheid is past .
they should be fully empowered , they should meet regularly and they should have the ability and the right to look at the macro and the micro issues .
in reality , on key issues - especially when it comes to transformation - at a policy level the province only moves when it is forced to do so by national legislation .
we are however worried that the province is raising funds in a situation where we have not been informed as to the criteria for the sale of those assets .
we have fought about it here - and perhaps it has reached its limit in the house - and should be taken up at higher levels in the country .
mr speaker , i want to mention just two things , and i hope that this will be accepted in the spirit of constructive and positive criticism in which it is mentioned .
one solution to our financial problem in the province is that we should give greater priority to the generation of our own funds in addressing our challenge .
over the past week it has become clear , in dealing with one of the budget votes , that we spend r115 million per annum on leasing buildings .
i call it a new-look vote because the office of the premier is now part of a department known as the department of provincial administration .
i believe the new structure has resulted in a finely tuned and lean administration , geared for even more effective delivery than we have seen to date .
there are 68 projects up and running in this province , with a r5,1 million kick-start from the national poverty alleviation fund , aimed at alleviating poverty .
no. i ask the hon minister in the office of the premier to withdraw it , because it is not parliamentary to call someone a liar .
the hon minister of finance and development planning has already given hon members an outline and the rationale for our still not having that business plan in place .
madam chairperson , everyone here is acquainted with the new management framework implemented in the public service on 1 july 1999 , and its practical consequences .
it is indeed necessary that citizens feel a sense of ownership of the public service , but this must be based on genuinely people-centred - that is , customer-centred - delivery .
there should be mechanisms based on commitment and a passion and deeper understanding of the role of these young people who played a role during the apartheid era .
i therefore call upon the hon minister to organise a youth summit to give her guidelines and the action plan that she lacks .
even though i am not a member of scof , i am pleased to know that the hon minister has submitted a business plan to the cabinet committee as requested .
a sustainable partnership between government , committees and business is required if real change and the permanent empowerment of our people are what we hope to achieve .
mr chairperson , in the vote of the hon premier he also deals with the fact that there should be a committee to oversee national and international interaction .
it is because we do not deal with the issues that affect the poor of this province , and those issues are the socio-economic issues and the socio-economic disease , tb .
i just want to refer the hon member to the report on the national gender audit completed in the western cape in september last year and released in december .
by the end of this year , 10,4 million african children under the age of 15 will have lost their mothers or both parents to aids .
the cabinet decides on the partners and the content of such agreements , but that does not mean that the hon member cannot have an input at that level .
i am sure , although it was not his maiden speech , that this was one of the major speeches he has made , and he did so very well .
after the rules committee had decided on the most essential expenditure , just over r5 million was requested , of which the hon minister of finance and development planning granted r2,368 million .
the budget of r21,6 million , if one looks back and compares it with the amount for the present financial year of just over r13 million , is an improvement .
it seems too easy to say to parliament , " you cannot achieve your objective because the money does not allow it .
i therefore support the notion that these funds be paid over to the parties for administration and that the committee chairpersons , in turn , appoint their own staff .
madam speaker , we have a capital amount of r500 000 for the provision of two translation booths , but there is nobody to man the booths .
] the question is whether we should put so much money in one person 's hands , as is the case with him and the hon member mr louis !
the location of the meeting at the sanp offices was because of its convenience and because it had various aerial photographs and layout plans , maps and so on .
the hon minister said he went there to be advised on conservation and development projects and the attitude of the public in the southern cape area .
mr speaker , in his opening address a few days ago the hon premier said that voter registration would be the most important issue that his government would be involved in .
( iv ) i led a team of decision-makers from the western cape to ireland to investigate their economic planning and decision-making .
i wonder whether he would not lobby with that good , kind editor that he knows so well to assist me in getting retractions printed .
our view in this regard was recently supported by the fact that the members of the gauteng consumer tribunal , immediately after their appointment , expressed similar reservations in a memorandum .
mr speaker , on the basis of his reply , is the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs saying that the hon member mr silke actually asked a stupid question ?
mr speaker , i give the hon leader of the opposition the assurance that i am a man of integrity and i certainly will do that .
this report was tabled quite some time after the end of the financial year , but i suppose that is what is " practicable " for the tender board .
there is no long procedure and there is nothing impracticable about tabling a report a month after it has been submitted .
mr speaker , could the hon minister possibly give us a sense of how many participants in the table bay homemaking club actually did become successful entrepreneurs ?
however , there are a number of integration , implementation and interpretation problems and these are currently being addressed via the dispute mechanism as set out in the contractual arrangement , as amended , between the two parties .
( 4 ) ( i ) the additional costs to the province arise from the delays associated with the first phase implementation of the tender .
( 3 ) whether the department has consulted the communities along the r300 on this failure ; if not , why not ; if so , which communities were consulted and when ?
transport is aware of the fact that sanral is negotiating with the housing department to fund the construction of a pedestrian bridge over the r300 .
as far as the allpay system is concerned , as hon members heard here in connection with the motion by the hon member mr silke , the standing committee met today .
that the approval does not give recognition to the rights that the applicants maintain that they have to the houses and that the agreement expires on 30 november 2000 .
mr speaker , i think that this is the fifth or sixth question from the hon member mr strachan which i am replying to in his absence , and i take pleasure in responding .
we will keep trying and we hope that the centralists on that side of the house will come with us and make africa work for all of us .
john-thompson boilers of the western cape were appointed by the un to investigate air pollution , which is caused by the coal used by china for power generation .
in the current context , when the dp and the new np at a national level talk about downsizing of the public service , we are now creating an overbloated senior management echelon .
that is a clear contradiction with their own policy , but what could r16 million , or r14 million as it was projected , actually create in terms of service delivery ?
do hon members realise that mr o ' connell , a superintendent-general in this administration , has 25 000 more officials than 18 directors-general in the central government combined ?
they have been alienated by a senior management level that wants to remain afrikaans - and i am really sorry if hon members feel offended by this - but white and male .
mr speaker , the answer to the question that was posed by the hon member mr isaacs is that this is a weak government with a weak government programme .
the national minister announced two weekends ago when we were together in khayelitsha at the church service that the be legal campaign would be implemented on 15 august 2000 .
now i see that the hon member mr ramatlakane , an anc member , is also shying away from it , because he knows that a great deal of it can be ascribed to the national government .
what that hon member should have done is gone back to his own party and asked them why they were tarrying , why were they delaying .
it transpired after a certain number of rounds of negotiation - the hon member mr ramatlakane was part of that in many instances - that it could not work .
i have found that there was substance to those complaints , for example , and in fact the contractor who was contracted to do those transport routes has been replaced by another contractor .
these dynamics differ from community to community and the issues are very complex and often have very little to do with race , but employment and quality-related issues .
the hon member mr mckenzie , who in his day was also the minister of community safety in the western cape , probably just made a freudian slip in his question .
they estimated that it will take about 10 police persons to actually man / woman / person such a station , whichever term hon members want to use .
mr speaker , the hon minister of transport , sport and recreation and the hon member mr ramatlakane have agreed that the reply should be handed to him in writing .
i must inform the hon member that the act will also have to undergo certain amendments and that the implementation of the regulation and the act will have to be simultaneous .
( a ) to address the question on the prevalence of tb , it is worrying to report that the prevalence has risen , not dramatically , but there is an increase .
how is it possible that there could be an administrative oversight to such an extent that a salary was not substantially adjusted once the minister had been demoted .
yes , 120 police members are deployed daily between 16 : 00 and 19 : 00 on 20 trains - about five members per train , normally - between cape town and paarl .
( 1 ) a task team with a mandate to draft a green paper for the management of provincial properties , has already made an in-depth study in this connection .
seven hundred and seventy six of the properties vesting in the name of the province : western cape , should in terms of housing legislation be transferred to the provincial housing development board : western cape .
what led him to decide to make such a serious accusation against the anc , on what information was it based and how was this information acquired ?
the question is whether this mechanism has been put into place by the provincial department of transport , and whether the criteria that have been drawn up have opened up loopholes for corruption practices to emerge .
subject to the promulgation of the enabling regulations , it is the intention of the board to finalise and implement the aforementioned preferential procurement policy during 2000-01 .
( 1 ) what is the status quo regarding the ownership rights of the land earmarked for the cape town international convention centre ;
( c ) the pharmacies are understaffed and the personnel have to contend with a steadily increasing number of patients , which contributes to long waiting times at health facilities .
the local authority - in this case the city of tygerberg - should ensure that sports fields are made available and are reasonably accessible to all the communities within its municipality .
mr speaker , the hon leader of the opposition has just tried to put my foot into a rugby mess that i do not want to be part of .
i have already announced that in keeping with other provinces , it is my view that the imc on aids would fall away in favour of a provincial aids council .
mr speaker , would the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism be willing to condemn omega for confusing the public in such a manner ?
during the training sessions for the implementation of the wced hiv / aids life skills and sexuality education programme schools are again made aware of the monitoring of precautions taken .
if that is the way they want to play politics , by trying to gain people 's attention , it is the wrong way to do it .
in the same vein , it is our duty as a provincial government to work together with the other levels of government in the pursuit of our vision in the western cape .
the test results will be closely monitored and the other eight provinces have undertaken to move forward together when the data from the test sites has been collated and analysed .
mr speaker , at the outset i wish to thank the members of the standing committee on finance sincerely for the way in which they participated in the meetings of scof .
mr speaker , i wish to take the opportunity to wish you , the hon premier and all hon members everything of the best for this year .
for every programme or vote some departments will bring in from 10 to 25 officials and the comment was that it was interesting to see so many people .
we should see that the smmes are focused on , especially the tourism entrepreneurship programme to the value of r290 000 that has also not yet been launched .
hon members will recall that prior to the change of ruling in this regard , officials whose birthdays fell during those months had to wait until april to receive their cheques .
looking at the 1999-2000 financial year , i am pleased to report a revenue retention of r60,2 million and i would congratulate those departments on their achievements .
] the premier : mr speaker , i said to those hon members : they are certainly not proud of the western cape , of all our achievements , are they ?
( 2 ) the only action that is being taken on an ongoing basis by this provincial government is the monitoring of the council 's efforts to enforce the conditions of approval .
as i said in my policy speech in september last year and as i reiterated this year , our policy is to move towards a market-related rental .
in our view , restitution is also part thereof , and public land should , inter alia , be used for restitution purposes for wrongs done in the past .
( 1 ) recognises today as international women 's day , and supports the movement , the world march of women 2000 , in which more than 3 700 groups from 149 countries will participate ;
in the forthcoming financial year we shall continue the annual refinement and updating of this fiscal policy framework which will continue to reflect the key priorities and deliverables of the provincial government .
accountancy functions will be fully decentralised to the departments of education , health and welfare , economic affairs , agriculture and tourism , as well as the provincial parliament as from 1 april 2000 .
it is very disturbing , in addition , that the hon member mr isaacs yesterday stood up and spoke about very severe problems with regard to empowerment and procurement in respect of the casino licence .
other transversal policies , including procurement , are not being implemented in all departments and there is a great deal of confusion with regard to those policies .
instead the national minister of finance has condemned this and every province to failure by projecting an average growth rate of only 3,4 % .
it is a pity that we cannot also enjoy it from the fruits of an innovative provincial economic strategy which breaks free from the confines of national government .
as hon members know , the acdp was the only political party that voted against the casino bill , because , as we have always said , it is going to cost us more .
i think it is important - i hope dr stegmann takes note of this - to talk about output and performance ; otherwise one might just get a false note there .
yesterday , when i spoke during the debate on vote 2 , i indicated that somehow i had mixed feelings about the debate .
madam chairperson , we have had the experience that the western cape , since 1995 , has failed to implement the procurement policy ten point plan , as it was called at that time .
i would like to put the record straight and say to the hon member that the anc said they would like to discuss the matter and then they would decide .
the taxpayer pays a member for the full day , but some hon members on that side of the house just come here and show their faces , and then they disappear .
madam chairperson , i wish to welcome the senior command structure of the saps in the western cape , commissioners max , crafford and holtzmann and director klein up in the gallery .
simultaneously , africa attracts only 3 % of world investment . the question is : will our liberal constitution and democratic values make a difference in attracting investors ?
this peace he refers to can be equated to both the political peace we all hoped and prayed for , and a crime-free peace as intended in our constitution .
now , following his budget speech , it is common knowledge that this was not a war against crime strategy , but rather a further shrinkage of the already over-strained police resources .
the effect is further eroded when one considers that this also covers the improvement of condition of service ( ics ) and expensive state-of-the-art fingerprint and other information technology systems .
the current personnel strength in the western cape is lower than the approved establishment for the province , which indicates that we should have just under 15 000 posts in total .
to the total 10 141 functionally trained police officials in the western cape hon members should add 1 789 civilian employees , which gives us just under 12 000 employees .
this , madam chairperson , makes a mockery of the mere 2,85 % increase - in real terms - for the police recently announced in the national budget .
there is clearly no room for movement to increase the levels of recruiting and training needed to improve the capacity of the police at any level .
further operations included newsletters with articles on alcohol abuse ; and breathalyser operations which were very successful for people who believed that they were still sober but were not .
to build a better relationship between the police and the people of the provinces by means of cooperation with the community police forums and other institutions of the civilian community .
they will be offered courses that will be both physically and mentally challenging in the expectation that they in turn will become core agents of change in their communities .
i wish to convey my sincere thanks to the hon minister of transport and works and the officials of the department of transport for their cooperation , particularly in the taxi violence operations .
we can start by firing corrupt officials who let our prison systems degrade into gang-infested territories causing prisoners to adopt even more dysfunctional behaviour upon their release .
similarly , the abuse of the elderly has come under the media spotlight and i would like to know what progress there has been in this regard as part of the triple a campaign as outlined .
i think it would be interesting if this house could decide to conduct a debate on all the factors that impact on the aspect of safety and security .
i am quite sure that at the end of such a debate most if not all of us would have a new perspective on the whole matter of community safety .
it is true that recalcitrant attitudes are still being encountered among certain policemen in the western cape ; people who do not wish to accept the reforms in the new south africa .
i believe that truancy is a direct consequence of the policy of the past which led to poor socio-economic conditions and other factors mentioned by the hon minister .
has he forgotten that the former minister of community safety was one of the people who negotiated the powers and functions of the police when the constitution was drafted ?
that is why more than 100 police officers from the cape town central police station are utilised on a daily basis to guard prisoners , instead of doing patrol duties .
i think the hon member mr a j williams perhaps went a little too far ; i must say i hope that will not mean the end !
we also want to thank the department for the r100 000 per annum allocated to school sport by way of an allocation to the united school sport association of south africa , ussasa .
i also want to make it very clear that as long as there are still imbalances in the different areas , we shall never stop talking about racism and inequality .
i think we have come a long way regarding this portfolio and i want to share the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation 's sentiments in respect of dr kane-berman .
the issue of where the facilities are located obviously needs to be addressed , but the hon member can understand that the vast majority of facilities are built by local authorities .
in my speech , i have just informed the house that we are giving r8 million for the upgrading of athlone stadium to bring it into line with international requirements .
be that as it may , however , i wish to inform the hon member mr ozinsky that the fact of the matter is that the state cannot provide everything .
although he took the one programme where there is a more or less 50 % split , there are other programmes that actually boost the contribution to sport participation substantially .
mr speaker , we govern a wonderful , vibrant , modern and sophisticated province , one of which its inhabitants , and even those in the rest of our country , can truly be proud .
wesgro states that this year the current indications are that our province will be creating more jobs than there are people entering the market in areas such as tourism , services and retail .
we should be proud that we have had more success with the masakhane project than any other province , as more people are now paying for more efficient and quality services .
international contacts and the exchange of expertise is vital if the western cape wants not only to maintain its present living standards , but to improve the quality of life of all its citizens .
this will be to the benefit of the whole of africa , when one realises that malaria is one of the biggest killers on our continent .
help us find solutions to our communal challenges in the same way our party does in the national assembly under our leader mr marthinus van schalkwyk .
forests are shrinking , soil is being eroded , water reserves are fading , fish resources are collapsing , devastating storms are increasing in number , and so are the fires .
we all know about the devastating fires which have brought much hardship to many people in various areas in the province , while 9 000 ha of nature reserve has been burnt out .
on the one hand president thabo mbeki wants an alliance of african states which can be called into action against undemocratic regimes on the african continent .
the latest example is an anc decision to appoint a high-level deployment committee which would select executive mayors for metropolitan councils wherever the anc is in control .
we had our final discussions with trade unions on this pioneering document this week , and it will be instituted in all our schools from the beginning of next term .
mr chairperson , from 1 april last year to the end of this financial year we will have spent r18 million on promoting safety in our schools .
mr chairperson , the vision for this project is to develop the education system in the western cape for the global knowledge economy - one of the core objectives of this administration .
the national government 's human resource policies are amongst the greatest obstacles in education development , grossly expensive and inefficient and elevating industrial relations considerations far above educational considerations .
the new model was developed in cooperation with an interministerial committee established by the national cabinet of which the national department of welfare has had the chairpersonship .
if there is no difference then for the sake of uniformity i should like us to call all schools high schools or secondary schools , and low schools or primary schools .
therefore sustained human resource development , management programmes and educator development that focuses on needs , skills and attitudes of the individuals who are implicated in educational change are vital .
mr chairperson , i am asking that the department develop a clear theory of educational change , that it begins to understand that educational change must be systemic .
at the same time the schools will have to begin with a task of education which will also involve fixing leaking taps , using power more economically and addressing vandalism in schools .
not far from manenberg senior secondary school is a school called silverstream senior secondary school , chaired by an extraordinary good principal , mr jacobs .
at the same time we cannot continue to effect cutbacks in our academic hospitals without causing a major collapse of academic medicine and a mass departure of professional expertise .
thanks to rotarians international the first two dedicated inter-hospital vehicles were taken into use in december 1999 , and another three vehicles will be in operation by the end of april 2000 .
i am proud to say that the total expenditure on capital works , maintenance and upgrading of r70 million in the 1999-2000 financial year increased to r122 million in the 2000-01 financial year .
in the spirit of batho pele and in the spirit of the charter of patient rights , it is important to us to ensure that this kind of behaviour is addressed .
madam chairperson , winter is on the way and everyone is worried about the major problem we may have in regard to the influenza virus that is heading our way .
when we started about eight months ago , i remember dr abdullah talking to me about his concern about the then proposed further cuts in the budget .
during the scof session i focused mainly on the government 's commitment to , i quote , " contain the spread of hiv / aids and tuberculosis " .
the fact that the national department of health failed to spend 40 % of its budget for hiv / aids is definite proof of mismanagement .
in fact , one advantage of having a centre away from the diseased area is that the staff will not be infected .
- rehabilitation services to promote the development of self-help initiatives by assisting people with disabilities to gain the necessary skills and attitudes and to sustain such initiatives .
it is a fresh start in terms of looking more outwardly at raising own revenue and at public / private partnerships and public / private mixes .
the introduction of community service for doctors has helped the supply of doctors , particularly in district hospitals , and the future implementation for dentists and pharmacists is also likely to be beneficial .
i am not sure why , but the management structures are always making excuses - they expect the hon minister to implement the provisions of the employment equity act .
we need a more flexible approach to granting private hospital licences so that thousands of nurses who received vsps can be re-employed by the private sector .
the first curative measures in respect of a cure-aid for tuberculosis have been put in place , but the incidence is going up because so many people come into the province with hiv / aids .
of fundamental importance is that this policy applies as much to the branch : social services - that is important for quality control - as it does to its service delivery partners .
on the positive side , we had a meeting with all role-players , including correctional services and the saps , to see how we can fast-track the process .
there was a need for children to have the opportunity to place matters on the agenda themselves in accordance with their needs , and this could be used as a forum for consultation .
the first represents a new approach to service delivery that is developmental in orientation , promotes the establishment of partnerships to fight poverty and reduce unemployment , and promotes social integration .
madam chairperson , irrespective of the existence of the best business plan and a monitoring and evaluation mechanism at national level for poverty alleviation , the poorest of the poor are still badly being neglected .
the person will have to examine the function and the interdepartmental , intersectoral and multidisciplinary liaison of the poverty relief desk in order to establish further the policy and guidelines for poverty relief .
other children 's homes , however , also admit children living with hiv / aids , and we want to encourage integration rather than isolation in separate facilities , unless the latter is absolutely necessary .
owing to the fact that aids is currently not a notifiable disease , however , the number of disability grants being paid out to people living with aids is unfortunately not known .
the idea is that we will continue to highlight the impact of hiv / aids on women and the difficulties they have in negotiating safe sex .
along with this service a new category of workers in social development needs to be trained , educated and redeployed to respond to the realities of the present south african social welfare conditions .
i would also agree with forums being established for children where they will have the opportunity to speak their minds on issues that affect their daily lives .
this department and its senior leadership and middle management , as well as its management at district and local level , have a job involving more than just providing social services .
it is quite correct to ask why the department of agriculture cannot play a role in developing the flagship projects , specifically the one in beaufort west .
in addition the department is well in advance with the compilation of a housing prioritisation model that will have as a basis the geographical distribution of the actual housing needs in the entire western cape .
since its adoption the provincial housing development board has already approved six projects of this nature , four projects of which are within the metropolitan area and two projects outside the metropole .
we also need the cooperation and understanding of frustrated and desperate communities , who are without shelter at present and do not understand the fact that we have limited funds .
there is a big market for those who qualify for the smaller subsidies , but can also definitely afford to maintain something larger than the normal subsidised unit .
in areas such as happy valley , we find houses of 16 m  to 18 m  , and he still says he is building houses for the community of the western cape .
madam chairperson , the constitution of the republic of south africa , 1996 ( act 108 of 1996 ) , states in section 26 with regard to housing , and i quote :
those residents had to hear from the local transitional council in paarl that they would not be able to acquire home ownership under this scheme , because those semi-detached houses had only one communal toilet .
every side of this house will heckle consistently , but i really want hon members to allow the hon minister of housing to give his reply .
the mechanisms that are in place at this stage for the whole transformation process are in a unicity commission within the metropolitan area , which consists of 11 members and an independent chairperson .
] that will show those hon members that there are people in the townships who are so poor that they cannot even pay their monthly rentals .
for example , in the bigger rural municipalities , the personnel costs may decrease as a result of personnel restructuring , while the transport costs increase because the area serviced is much bigger .
in the first place , i want to express my disappointment at the exclusion of not only the smaller parties , but even independent councillors legitimately elected by the communities .
madam chairperson , at the outset i wish to express my appreciation of the helpfulness of the department of local government and the accessibility of the hon minister of local government .
] the hon premier 's answer to us was that he felt that the hon minister 's decision was based on the fact that certain skills were necessary .
the hon member mr mckenzie can say what he likes , but what was done was done in the interests of the western cape , and i believe that it goes further than the western cape .
i made it clear in my address that we will respond to it and , if it is necessary that we supplement it , we will certainly do that too .
this undeveloped coastal land , in many instances , has an intrinsic natural and cultural significance , not only from a spatial land use point of view , but also from an ecological or conservation point of view .
this allocation is , however , subject to certain conditions which may result in the amount only becoming available in addition to next year 's allocation of a conditional grant .
the sixth matter i wish to discuss is the compilation and implementation of a provincial strategic plan to coordinate the execution of provincial development objectives through programme management .
accordingly , i have decided to abide by the legal advice we have obtained and launch a formal review application in the high court to have the approval annulled .
planning in isolation in the past has resulted in the fact that at present 4,5 % of the western cape 's residents are without adequate water , and 7,9 % are without adequate sanitation .
i want to stress again that the danger exists , in the absence of a metropolitan spatial development framework , of that land ending up in the wrong hands for the wrong purposes .
i believe that these plans are vital for the overall planning process to become just and equitable , and that the delays seem to cause untold problems for local authorities .
with the exception of a few local authorities that are objecting to the implementation of the act , we are of the opinion that this act must be implemented as soon as possible .
mr chairperson , whereas local authorities are on the threshold of a most comprehensive process of transformation , i foresee major problems specifically with regard to capacity in respect of development planning .
in fact , the workplace environment , the culture within the department , must be made conducive to transformation and encourage the level of transformation happening in the hon minister 's department .
in the same breath , and perhaps i am wrong , i want to ask that if a review board is appointed , this board , like other boards , should also appear before the standing committee .
at local government level there are elected councillors who are largely elected on party lists , and at provincial level there are ministers and ourselves who are involved in these processes .
now , if the pdc becomes simply a business arm for the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism , then those organisations will have no role in the process .
i could see , even before the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism came to me , that certain work that wesgro is doing is being done by the provincial development council .
as an independent entity , the commissioner will ensure good governance and decision-making in matters affecting the environment and will provide a vital bridge between the disciplines of planning and environmental affairs .
in a memorandum prepared by the department in january this year , with the title " the socio-economic cost of delayed environmental approvals " , the following figures were emphasised .
i am satisfied that we are fulfilling our legal and constitutional duties of fairness and equity in the presentation of this budget and are creating opportunities for economic empowerment .
that is one of the objectives of this committee , to strive to achieve equal treatment of the three official languages of the western cape , namely afrikaans , english and isixhosa .
i am grateful that the hon minister and his department are going to build on this so that the performance of the cape coons will continue to be a highlight of the western cape cultural calendar .
as soon as we allow processes that belong in government to be outsourced to private enterprise , we create a situation in which people use the system to make a quick buck .
the steep rise can be ascribed to several myths , including the belief that hiv-infected men can rid themselves of the virus if they have sex with virgins .
while the hon minister must be commended on spending r806 000 on brown issues , it is hardly a paradigm shift in a total budget of r59 million .
promoting these campaigns is a very slow process , because for centuries apartheid colonialists systematically suppressed the talents , the creativity and the capacity of the majority of south africans .
they have the equipment and everything they need to work but they have no work - they sit and kill time in the backyard .
the hon minister of education has the green schools project , in terms of which schools are greened and some education takes place , but i agree that we can do much more .
popular culture includes film and video , crafts , modern music and jazz , street theatre , modern dancing , traditional dances , youth awareness of and involvement in culture , oral history traditions , murals and so forth .
however , one of the key measurable objectives of the department , as i have said , especially in cultural affairs , is addressing the youth 's tolerance toward one another , and the youth camps .
i felt the hon member 's speech was somewhat political and did not address the budget , but i thank her for her contribution .
at this stage it provides that a municipal treasurer may only grant clearance for immovable property to be transferred once all taxes and levies on that property have been paid .
seventy-five thousand people could have had ownership today , but the anc is too decent to get up and say , " we apologise .
that hon member will remember that one of the things that they promised the voters was that they would ensure that those rental arrears would be written off .
mr speaker , i am convinced that by now my learned colleagues in the house know that all our expenditure is funded from the western cape provincial revenue fund .
madam chairperson , to enable the department of transport to optimally contribute towards the provincial roads policy goals the following eight core strategies have been identified :
madam chairperson , i said last year that i had put a proposal to the cabinet , through the department , that we upgrade the subdirectorate to a full-fledged directorate .
although legislation to make toll roads possible in the province already exists , we must not regard this source of revenue as a panacea for all our financial difficulties .
in the rest of the country , in comparison with the same period last year , deaths increased by 7,5 % , but this province has experienced a decline of 33 % .
this difference is largely due to the transfer of r19 million to the programme administration , as well as r74 million , allocated at a late stage on the 1999-2000 adjustments appropriation .
we should not focus on the short-term ; we should focus on the long-term and we need to address the problem of provision being made for parking .
had he not dreamt dreams of people committing fraud with casino licences , and so on , we would have had the money to finish the road .
i had never really paid attention to where the clearance certificate has to be placed - whether it should be at the bottom or the top of the windscreen of a vehicle .
i had always thought that it would be a good thing if people did have the clearance certificate on the windscreen of their vehicle , because apparently many people travel without it nowadays .
i should be obliged if the hon minister would issue a mild warning , so that people who do see to it that they have the disc can be dealt with less harshly .
hon members will note that i have not used the name " works " , because the actual name of this department is " public works " in terms of the constitution .
south africa has one of the highest levels of income inequality in the world , with poverty being distributed primarily along racial lines and due mainly to the policies of apartheid .
at the same time i want to thank other people like messrs carel du preez , jakkie van heerden and roy petersen for the work they have done this year and last year .
i want to say to the hon member mr byneveldt that when we come into this house , we do not report back with statistics and say what has already been said .
a survey of the vote shows that there is poor coordination between the vision , the objectives of the department and the ministry and the establishment of an integrated development framework .
therefore , before there is a paradigm shift in the thinking of the coalition government , the vision presented to us today by the hon minister will remain a mere ideal .
it is gratifying that the national minister of transport is beginning to realise that the decay of the roads will have a direct impact on the economic development of the country .
but probably one of the most exceptional attractions in that region is that paragliding is very successful there .
the only good thing they did was the winnie mandela anti-smoking campaign , and that was when they said , " get rid of your stompie !
mr chairperson , i wish to dwell today on the tremendous work being done by the roads department of the little karoo district council under the leadership of the young and extremely competent mr japie strydom .
for the information of the hon minister , it is two weeks since the date of that removal and , believe it or not , there are still no cisterns .
mr du preez mentioned this morning that we must try to generate revenue in that way so that we can use the money to maintain infrastructure and roads .
the hon member mr louis expressed his pleasure at the fact that dorp street is almost finished and spoke about the small amount of work that must still be done there .
i would not like the hon member to refer to the western cape as being a province that is obstructionist - always obstructing the course of democracy .
let us say that the western cape , kwazulu-natal , mpumalanga or whatever province , has the moral duty to see to it that the national department of transport does not collapse .
( 1 ) notes that , as a result of certain outstanding debts , sales in execution of so-called rdp houses in calitzdorp were carried out by the local municipality on 23 march 2000 ;
the budget statement also sets out the eight strategic objectives for this department , and i trust that hon members have considered them carefully in their analysis of our budget for today .
madam chairperson , to deal with the job creation challenge it is paramount to understand the nature of the structural change that has occurred in the global economy .
within the global it industry , 70 % of turnover of products sold by companies , originated from products produced during the past two years .
in short , we have been presented with a double dose of increased competition at a time when most companies are simply struggling to survive one dose .
the department has already been working for more than a year on the document and the broad direction that we propose , and it has been stated repeatedly in public .
madam chairperson , i do not want the house to have any illusions about the minefields that await all of us as we rewrite the liquor laws in this province .
in line with this competency gauteng province enacted a consumer affairs unfair business practices act modelled on the erstwhile national harmful business practices act of 1988 .
there is , however , a clear need for legislation of this type and we have therefore requested specific legal opinion on how we can purge the draft bill of any unconstitutional elements .
in this field the core areas for attention will be attracting new investment , enhancing skills and education , encouraging innovation and building a high tech environment .
the cape online project is calculated to create a regional portal for our province that will vastly increase the exposure of western cape users to the internet and e-commerce .
madam chairperson , i pause here to say that one of the problems with the national liquor act that we currently enforce , is the lack of an appeal mechanism .
another element that the hon minister did not raise today in his speech was the dedicated communication project aimed at unpacking the free trade agreement between south africa and the european union .
my appeal is for ongoing enthusiasm and the increasing and clear marketing of local industry programmes in the entire western cape with a view to attracting foreign entrepreneurs and industrialists .
it is sad and lamentable , however , that the hon minister has taken so long to recognise this and to act on it , but what has been announced is to be welcomed .
she and her family suffer greatly from the continual thump-thump and far too loud head-bashing music that carries on 24 hours a day seven days a week .
" the police also seem not to have the time or infrastructure to handle complaints of this nature , while there are more pressing problems like rape and murder .
when formulating the new liquor policy , local government need to come on board with regard to the advertising system currently used for rezoning of properties for business purposes within residential areas .
however , there is no guarantee that growth in tourism will be sustainable , still less that the tourism industry can be the drive or stimulus for economic growth as a whole .
it is a pity that the hon minister did not give her the credit and that she is not even here today to listen .
notwithstanding this dominance of local investments , the cape tourism industry also offers significant scope for foreign , small and medium-sized firms interested and able to enter the hospitality and leisure sectors .
the average length of a trip to the western cape for domestic visitors was 9,5 nights in 1996 , which is 50 % more than the national average of 6,2 nights .
if the hon minister asks nicely , and if his finger lunch is really good , i will give him all the documents that i have at may disposal from the conference .
the dilemma was just that the merlin system was not suitable for its management and we therefore had to buy in another system , the mba property management system , to manage it .
if the hon minister of housing does not provide and assist with housing , the basic framework within which people need to operate to be empowered will not be there .
it is not only as a result of the climatic characteristics of the province , but also due to the fact that farming has reached a high level of sophistication .
an eloquent example of this is the irrigation of 5 ha of common land , in which case a partnership has been concluded between the municipality of vredendal , the vredendal farmers ' association and the unemployed .
in other words , i find a very strong undertone of a narrow capitalist agricultural strategy whereby aspects such as the development of emerging farmers and farm workers become an " add-on " .
in discussions with employee organisations they have consistently told us that job relations and human relations on a farm where the trade union has set its foot , have disappeared .
in the national assembly the minister of finance only referred to agriculture in his budget address when he announced the discriminatory measures in favour of the marine industry .
on 10 march 2000 i was with a group of six farm workers who heard that it was unacceptable to arrive two minutes late , and who were dismissed .
i ask that we cooperate to ensure that the 2000-01 budget ensures a better life for all - agriculture , farm workers and farmers .
if hon members look carefully at our budget , they will see that we are spending approximately 30 % of the budget on 10 % of the people who need it .
i want to thank the hon member ms rossouw for the support and understanding i get from her and also for the fact that she says that farm workers are important .
to assist the house i want to ask the leader of the house whether it is possible to incorporate what the hon member mr ramatlakane has said .
mr speaker , we govern a wonderful , vibrant , modern and sophisticated province , one of which its inhabitants , and even those in the rest of our country , can truly be proud .
wesgro states that this year the current indications are that our province will be creating more jobs than there are people entering the market in areas such as tourism , services and retail .
we should be proud that we have had more success with the masakhane project than any other province , as more people are now paying for more efficient and quality services .
international contacts and the exchange of expertise is vital if the western cape wants not only to maintain its present living standards , but to improve the quality of life of all its citizens .
this will be to the benefit of the whole of africa , when one realises that malaria is one of the biggest killers on our continent .
help us find solutions to our communal challenges in the same way our party does in the national assembly under our leader mr marthinus van schalkwyk .
forests are shrinking , soil is being eroded , water reserves are fading , fish resources are collapsing , devastating storms are increasing in number , and so are the fires .
we all know about the devastating fires which have brought much hardship to many people in various areas in the province , while 9 000 ha of nature reserve has been burnt out .
on the one hand president thabo mbeki wants an alliance of african states which can be called into action against undemocratic regimes on the african continent .
the latest example is an anc decision to appoint a high-level deployment committee which would select executive mayors for metropolitan councils wherever the anc is in control .
they have appealed to me and my department for protection and supply of transport facilities and we are compelled to comply with that appeal by the community .
it is a privilege to bring to the house this piece of legislation , which is regarded as an urgent measure in terms of rule 147 ( 3 ) ( b ) .
if it is in the pound and the owner loses income for 30 days , there could be a claim against the state regarding loss of income .
in a previous debate the problem was raised with the hon minister of transport and works , and there has been no corrective action to resolve this problem .
the daily anguish and rampant poverty that prevails in these communities can do without the blatant disregard for the rule of law shown by the taxi industry .
let me remind this house that a few days ago the hon minister was asked to go outside this building to receive a memorandum from the taxi drivers .
mr speaker , it is no longer a surprise to the anc that the dp has once again illustrated what can only be described as a holier-than-thou attitude .
the socio-economic situation has deteriorated so much that everybody wants to demand his / her pound of flesh , which eventually leads to lawlessness , to the extent that the whole community is disrupted .
i agree with the hon member mr louis that it is essential that we consider the rights of people and also the rights of the various transport agencies .
the cabinet goes through a bill and if the cabinet is not happy with it , it has to go back to the department after which the legal representative has to do his thing ...
if we had proceeded under pressure , then section 30c would have been included in the amendment bill and we should have had problems , because then we would have had to find places to store impounded vehicles .
the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation is in the meantime waiting at hout bay and tokai and in the waterfront to put in his appearance , to perform .
] i propose that that hon member listens , or else i shall repeat tomorrow that it went in one ear and out the other .
] we can be as silly as we like here and we can make the smartest interjections , but we cannot bring life back to those people who have been murdered .
mr speaker , this violence , and many other social evils that we are faced with in our communities , are a symptom of one of our biggest enemies , namely unemployment .
mr speaker , the hon member mr byneveldt began with fine examples , so much so that he almost had me in tears , but then he messed everything up .
mr speaker , with all due respect to the hon member mr fransman i want to say that if we do not stand together , we will be guilty of the murders and rapes .
mr speaker , on a point of order : i think the hon members should give the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation the opportunity to reply .
i appeal to them to see to it that the 16 to 20-year-old men stand in a queue to take that course , so that they can be prevented from joining gangs .
may i just say that the contribution made by the hon member mr marais with regard to the role of the sandf is a very valid one .
but it is amazing , and i have the statistics here , that wherever the anc has taken over the control of a cpf they have started to politicise it .
] the trauma rooms are no longer used , the jails are no longer painted and they stop requesting funds for projects for the community .
this is - and this is a fact - the only province that paid , that chose to pay , its public servants to go and work .
when the hon premier spoke about the bad apples , i sat in anticipation , waiting to hear about the two bad apples , the new np and the dp .
mr speaker , i have no doubt in saying that this province was meeting its constitutional obligations by participating in the way it did .
does it also mean that we must now summons the national government to come and report here about the money in terms of rule 115 of the national constitution ?
madam chairperson , to deny us the right to replies to those questions , either in scof or in the house , is to deny good governance and democracy .
some of the questions we asked in scof were put in writing and sent to the ministries to respond to , and hon members have the replies .
if the hon member did not understand , i wish to re-emphasise that this came from management administration , which has nothing to do with the building of houses .
r1 000 came from programme 1 , administration ; from programme 2 , technology development and transfers , subsection 3 ( a ) , r9 350 ; and from programme 3 , agricultural engineering , r11 044 .
there was no way in which i can tell hon members which amount of this money went to the top management and which went to lower management .
that hon member said they had been paid r1 000 per month , but when i spent r18 000 he asks me how many people i employed .
madam chairperson , the hon minister of social services and poverty relief said the money came from savings in the department of social services and poverty relief .
madam chairperson , could the hon minister of education please indicate to the house from which programme and subprogramme in particular the amount of r52 354,84 was derived ?
madam chairperson , i tell the hon member now that i support a motion to have registered voters when it was critically important to do so .
madam chairperson , could the hon minister of housing explain from which programmes and subprogrammes almost r500 000 was saved in this financial year , which is not completed yet ?
i am concerned about the fact that you as deputy speaker and the office of the speaker should have arranged for a place where the members can eat .
madam chairperson , i want to know whether the hon minister of health in this schedule , when applying his mind , obtained any information about personnel in his department ?
madam chairperson , i do not have the answer to the hon member ms essop 's question , but i will investigate it and supply her with the full details .
madam chairperson , what i have had absolute assurance of was that before any expenditure was taken from education , there was an agreement that it would be repaid .
it means the whole budgetary process has been thrown into question because at the beginning of a financial year when departments are repeatedly saying , " we need money " , ...
these pathologies have threatened from time to time to undo the very things that give us hope for the future and come so naturally to our province .
mr speaker , i welcome the many conciliatory noises from the hon leader of the opposition that the time has come to put that debate behind us .
therefore , our duty and intention is to proactively create a safety net wherein these people can find some alternative assistance within the activities of the department .
this process has already started and we will on a daily basis work with the affected individuals and communities to alleviate and address the emergency .
therefore i am astonished that in his opening address the hon premier sought to suggest that it was otherwise , and i refer to p 3 of his printed speech .
i liked what i heard when the hon minister of social services and poverty relief said we must be practical and people must feel the difference .
] all attempts by various role-players to curb the senseless killings in our farming communities have been swept off the table by the blatant statement of the minister .
let me return to what i was going to do at the beginning of my speech before i was so rudely diverted and extend my thanks to various people .
however , they may not do this if they are principals or deputy principals of schools or if they have been elected as mayors or executive committee members of their respective councils .
it is our hope that the hon premier has the will to take up the principle of cooperative government with the same vigour as he is showing towards cape town .
i would also like to join the hon premier in welcoming our two new colleagues , the hon minister of social services and poverty relief and the hon member mr redcliffe .
this is not only a seasonal trade , but out of season the gang members cum pushers prey on the youth at our schools and in our community .
mr speaker , i want to say to the hon member mr winde that influx from anywhere to anywhere else is a very common phenomenon in the world .
i appeal to hon members on both sides of the house to give the hon member ms rossouw the opportunity to deliver her speech .
surely a person who picks only seven boxes of grapes cannot expect to receive the same wage as a person who is prepared to pick up to 120 boxes .
he went on to say that this province would not be hamstrung by conditions that would be laid down for other provinces once the testing phase had been completed .
let me also take this opportunity to add my voice to those that have already wished all mpps and members of staff a happy and prosperous new year .
we therefore sincerely hope that president mbeki will use the occasion of the opening of national parliament on friday to reinstall that confidence in this administration .
our research has shown that the number of permanent workers and their dependants on farms in the area have decreased from 35 000 in 1995 to 21 000 last year .
this unfavourable situation will not only harm the primary and secondary industries and the community of the southern cape , but also the performance of the larger western cape .
mr speaker , i would like to know if the hon member dr van zyl is prepared to take a question on what she is saying .
the perception of the anc leader in the western cape is not good - neither among his supporters nor among the public nor among the media .
safety may not be jeopardised ; international trade agreements must be complied with ; and any internationally acceptable , statutory measure resulting in cheaper medicine , even parallel imports , will be supported by us .
mr speaker , on the positive side , we have seen in this appropriation real delivery , and it is real delivery in terms of the khanye project to provide computers for schools .
the person will have to examine the function and the interdepartmental , intersectoral and multidisciplinary liaison of the poverty relief desk in order to establish further the policy and guidelines for poverty relief .
somehow - for some political reason it would seem to me - they were not considered appropriate to receive their r400 .
as hon members know , at present there are closed-circuit tv cameras in the cbd of cape town and they have been very effective in helping to reduce the crime rate .
i would like to draw the attention of the house to the fact that the r10 million came from the r135 million sunwest / sun international metropolitan casino licence bid .
madam chairperson , i am asking the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism how he decided to give r400 to about 5 200 farm workers in the southern cape .
madam chairperson , i would like to ask the hon premier when we can expect a business plan for this money , given that we have been waiting a year and a half for it .
the only concession at that time was that some of the cameras were installed on government buildings and there were proprietary rights involved in leases , which gave certain monetary concessions .
the fact of the matter is that there is a total amount of approximately r750 000 to be paid but the western cape government is not the only role-player .
that the house thanks the minister of agriculture for his initiative to obtain funds to build a dam for the benefit of the small farmers in the dysselsdorp region .
i have been engaged in this with the hon minister and i will continue to engage in trying to find lasting solutions in the public transport system .
the anc is in charge of transport in this country , makes the laws that govern the roads of this country , and has brought about the confusing recapitalisation process that has taken place .
the first stage to regulate and control the minibus taxi industry by converting all legal permits from radius to route-based will be completed by the end this year .
( 4 ) this group is volatile and in such conditions this is a recipe for the spread of disease , abuse , self-abuse , sodomy , degradation , despair , suicide and death ;
( 2 ) beatings and evictions of farm workers on farms continue to happen in our province without consistent condemnation from the coalition government and in particular the premier ;
sir , this bill , therefore , is a vital step in preparing our city and the province for the ultra-tough long-term competition for international visitors in which we now find ourselves .
i must mention that the latter figure does not include the 12th summit of the non-aligned movement , which also cost south africa 's taxpayers quite a lot of money .
the convention centre , of course , is also an ideal adjunct to the " secret season " promotion campaign , aimed at selling cape town at this time of the year .
i am sure that at the end of the day , whatever fears were expressed to the auditor-general will be allayed in the answers and the way in which the convention centre will operate .
durban and johannesburg could certainly capture the domestic leisure and corporate markets , but cape town has the potential to be the premier draw card for international conventions and exhibitions .
it defines empowerment in terms of the taps programme of sunwest , and hon members will not believe it , but it refers to the 10-point plan , which is now a dinosaur !
in a paragraph off the website on the convention centre it states that he is also a director and shareholder in a number of private and public hotels , restaurants and tourism-related companies .
not for one minute did the hon minister mention his own name ; he mentioned the name of mr otto stehlik who is linked with the protea hotel group .
subject to subsection ( 1 ) above , nothing prevents the provincial government from , at any time , making further contributions to or purchasing additional equity in convenco .
it is interesting that if one waits to get a bill through , then one is delaying it too much and if one brings it too early , one is rushing it through .
in the standing committee the hon minister 's motivation for clause 2 being crucial was the fact that subsection ( 1 ) had confined this to the convenco agreement .
we argued that , simply put , if there were going to be future amendments to convenco , if the situation or shareholders changed , one would have to amend the convenco agreement as well .
hon members can say i am flying a kite , but this is what happened in the committee meeting and this is not what was officially amended .
( v ) report of the auditor-general on a performance audit of government motor transport at the former department of transport of the western cape provincial administration [ pr 94 / 1999 ] ;
vote 16 - transport and public works ( auditor-general 's report [ pr87 / 1999 - page 14 , paragraph 3.12 ] ) : replies to informal queries and management letters
in category a the paragraphs stop at ( d ) , but we inserted paragraphs ( e ) , ( f ) , ( g ) and ( h ) .
one does wonder whether the hon member mr mckenzie is not right , whether they do not want to accept the system of executive mayor purely out of fear for their election potential .
i wish to state clearly that the new np is entering the election with confidence and that in any event we shall settle the hash of the anc at the polling booths .
time and again it is being spelt out in the national and international sphere that the success or failure of a prosperous country , state or province is determined by effective , legitimate and quality service delivery at local government level .
yes , from time to time there are differences in emphasis about local government , but i thank hon members for the support we have received in the whole process of transformation .
he said that category a should have an executive mayor as well as category b. why did he not say that category c should also have an executive mayor ?
but even the gangs know that they have nothing to fear , because their cases will not appear before the court because pressure is being exerted on the judiciary ...
prof millner in his 1961 study of judicial backgrounds , entitled , apartheid and south african courts , identified the judiciary 's inarticulated major premise as being a deeply embedded conviction of human inequality .
we also believe that that criticism will assist them in the rehabilitation of those members of the judiciary whose inarticulated thoughts are still embedded in the apartheid era .
a question in my mind is this : out of 192 judges in south africa , how many are white male as against white female , and black male as against black female ?
in his contribution to the independence of the judiciary , the minister of justice , when he met dr boesak at the airport , said , " this man is innocent .
i would like to ask hon members on that side of the house to give a single example of where the anc-led government has interfered with a judgment .
we are saying that we need a mechanism whereby the judicial service commission will provide for a complaint procedure against judges who citizens perceive have abused their powers .
had it not been that the president put a stop to it , it was clear interference when the portfolio committee wanted judges to come and explain their judgments to the committee .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon minister if she could explain to us how the dp can support trade unions in zimbabwe and not in south africa ?
we refer to mrs kosana 's application for a housing loan , dated 3 may 2000 , and regret to advise that we are unable to accede to her request .
mr speaker , i am raising this issue because a number of black-owned small and medium enterprises apply for business loans from financial institutions and come up against a brick wall .
one can offer one 's house or perhaps one 's car as collateral , which means that black businesses who own property in black townships in fact have no collateral .
the cape metropolitan council also announced in may this year that r5,7 million would be invested in its area in community-based projects for job creation and the development of small business .
mr speaker , the smmes nabcat , sabtaco and aba have identified the provision of bank guarantees , access to bridging finance and bank credit ratings for construction companies as the three key areas in the construction sector .
the dp recommends that the institutional support by the government for the smmes be streamlined , and that the national small business council ( nsbc ) should be scrapped immediately .
i am glad that the hon member mr gelderblom , as a member of the new np in the western cape , has distanced himself from the national new np mp , andre gaum .
dene smuts on behalf of the dp has said , " it is all nonsense , and it is political games . any aggrieved people must take a class action in court .
they are now not paying money to the network of small business support centres across south africa which they put up and accredited , and they have left black business people throughout south africa in the lurch .
there are survivalist enterprises at the bottom end and real small business that can compete commercially at the other end. one cannot deal with them on the same basis .
the department has not exercised any power conferred upon the board , but rather exercised a power not approved by the board prior to such exercising of such power .
- management 's risk assessment at that stage indicated a high failure potential in respect of all the above requirements if equipment with lesser capacity were to be acquired ;
on the contrary , failure by the administration to conduct a proper exam would have been an indictment against its ability to effectively administer its statutory assigned responsibilities ; and
vote 11 - environment and cultural affairs ( auditor-general 's report [ pr19 / 2000 - page 2 , paragraph 2.2.1 ( a ) ] ) : unauthorised expenditure , r34 406,69
vote 12 - education ( auditor-general 's report [ pr 66 / 2000 - page 2 , paragraph 2.2.1 ( a ) ] ) : unauthorised expenditure , r3 850 140,72
a fixed percentage rate must be levied , but local councils should ring-fence how much of this rate is spent directly on municipal services and what percentage is used for redistributive purposes .
madam speaker , let us for a short while examine the apparent attack of the dp on the property rates bill and see what the hysteria and histrionics are all about .
we believe that every citizen of the province and the unicity must have access to a basic package of services - and i will come to the issue of rates .
madam speaker , commercial agriculture will not be able to sustain its contribution to economic development and progress in the rural areas against the background of the deteriorating security situation .
nor can a farmer farm with a rifle or a revolver in his hand in order to protect himself , because he needs his hands to farm .
it is noted that june / july is the start of the budgetary process and provision should be made for this process in the parliamentary program .
the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling , having considered the subject of the western cape eighth gambling and racing amendment bill [ b11-2000 ] , ...
mr speaker , the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling supported the western cape eighth gambling and racing amendment bill together with amendments and has no objection to it .
the board now has the power to approve , upon application , the unlicensed possession of gambling devices and will therefore know in advance what is permissible or not .
the amendment should be seen in conjunction with the changes to the definition of " social gambling " , which now clarifies exactly the circumstances under which such gambling can take place .
licence holders or operators can therefore be assessed on an ongoing basis regarding the lawful application of said licences , thus making for a better regulated and monitored industry .
finally , in the april 2000 council meeting the new np outvoted the dp and anc councillors , who voted together on the matter , and said the issue was closed .
i should also say that there is an act which gives the hon premier the power to appoint a commission of inquiry , as outlined in the motion .
i want the hon members messrs mckenzie and ozinsky to be brave enough and man enough to make these allegations about the building inspector in the street .
] i spoke to our legal people , unlike hon members on that side of the house who go to the press and then they are in big trouble .
] mr speaker , whether it is true or not , i find it unacceptable that a board , without discussing the affidavit , could just accept it unanimously .
we are watching the black empowerment component of that development with a magnifying glass , because up to now i do not think it has reached the standard required in black empowerment .
mr speaker , on a point of order : is it in order for the hon minister to heckle , saying , " that was a lie !
] every single person has an interest in seeing that this convention centre is successful , because the entire tourism industry in this province is going to benefit from the convention centre .
we had been invited to a national cabinet meeting , together with the premiers and ministers of finance from the other provinces , to deal with the horizontal and vertical divisions on finance .
even their alliance partners - as we saw in the press reports today , and confirmed on numerous occasions - are seeing the arrogance being displayed by the anc .
best of all is that before the bomb exploded , members of the intelligence service were standing around there chatting to one another , while others sat in the cars .
the national government , through its two ministers , the ministers of safety and security and for justice and constitutional development , states that pagad is responsible for the terror .
mr speaker , let me spell out the reality , and we can completely ignore the reasons presented by the hon minister of social services .
there are well-qualified people of colour in this province who could be appointed to any position and could do the work expected of them there .
it is dangerous to assume that at the point of 1994 when we voted and elected mr mandela as our president there was an equality or equilibrium .
once one starts labelling groups and defines every member of that group according to some or other physical characteristic , then one descends into the arena of racism .
mr speaker , the motion before the house is nothing other than a provocative , cheap trick that should be dismissed out of hand and with contempt .
cheryl carolus is coming , but he need not be concerned - she is not coming to take over the mayorship , but to take his place .
- on 25 july 2000 , r8,9 million was allocated to vote 3 - finance to sustain the operations of the western cape gambling and racing board .
the fact that the hon minister is saying nothing , and says that everything on the farms is fine , creates an impression which does not correspond with the truth and the reality .
the employee 's involvement in the farm and his subordination to the employer is not the result of inequality but is based on a relationship of service with his employer .
the relationship between employer and employee is a delicate one at times , but more so in agriculture , where the additional element of access to land enters the picture .
we in the da want to empower farm workers to take out the drudgery of labour servitude and make these labourers more self-sufficient and successful farmers in their own right .
the sickness to which he has referred is nothing but the racism that farm workers , as i have just spelt out , are still experiencing in the western cape today .
2. report of the standing committee on economic development , on the construction industry development board bill [ b 59-2000 ] , dated 2 october 2000 , as follows :
it is further recommended that the administration actively monitor municipalities so that they retrospectively correct their financial administration of housing matters according to the guidelines with effect from 1 april 1998 .
( b ) obtain a legal opinion from the chief state law advisor on the mandate and locus standi of the national bargaining council , the provincial division thereof and the provincial administration .
( e ) the fairness and cost effectiveness of the pricing system that was used and if it was to the benefit or loss of the administration , compared to open tenders ;
the western cape recommends that the relevant provisions of clause 5 and other financial aspects of the bill be revisited in the light of the provisions of the pfma .
negotiations were entered into with three contractors whose names had been supplied by the department of works and only one was prepared to accept the assignment within the cost limitations .
none of the other ministers in both the new np and the dp could provide us with answers regarding moneys that had come from their budget votes .
the education and health votes have been allocated r2,197 million for the reimbursement of costs incurred in assisting with the registration of voters for the national elections of last june .
in conclusion , mr speaker , i wish to thank my cabinet colleagues , department heads and the staff in the province for their support and restraint in our continuing drive towards fiscal discipline .
i would like to say to the hon premier - i hope that he is listening - that although we really believe that his intentions are noble , actions speak louder than words .
i always say that i do not understand about grades in school , but in the south peninsula , r22 million per week is spent on drugs , alcohol and cigarettes by the grade 11s !
when a small group of racists in newlands and clare-mont , led by councillor ian iversen , say they do not want soccer in claremont and newlands , i am outraged .
not only do we have no policy framework , but we have uncovered evidence of a one-off payment of r400 in august 2000 - correct me if i am wrong .
] mr speaker , precedents abound worldwide to show that when governments start to attack the media , it is a clear sign .
it started at leadership level with the arrogance of the leaders of that political party , and has spread like a virus to the rank and file supporters of that party .
in fact , the anc is now guilty of caring more about the survival of its own political party than about the survival of democracy in south africa .
only six months after its formation the da has succeeded in arresting the drift towards a single dominant political party system and its logical conclusion - a one-party state .
mr speaker , on a point of order : the hon member mr mckenzie says that he is still going to get the blacks to the polls , but the election is over .
] the da may be ruling the province , but they must remember that they never got an outright majority vote in this parliament from having won the province .
i must add , however , that the hon minister also misled me in that he was coping with it well , and this ensures an enjoyable debate , but i will protect him from now on .
mr speaker , the time has come for the voters of the western cape to take note of what appeared in that article from the cape argus of 30 january 2001 .
the message of our hon premier and the leadership of our hon minister of local government and development planning set the example of service delivery and responsible government in this regard .
what we see on the one hand in the former white areas is an extremely high mobilisation , with turnout being in the region of 70 % to 80 % .
in both culture and the environment we will not be patronising to our people by taking high culture to them or castigating them on environmental issues .
i want to put another challenge to the house and i want us to do it in the context of the hon premier 's objectives for this year .
statistics provided by crime intelligence show that youths in the age group 12 - 25 years are responsible for 80 % of the crime committed in the townships .
the hon premier and the hon minister of education talked about the 80 % pass rate , and i think my colleague the hon member mr gabru alluded to that .
mr speaker , the economy is proof of what was apparent throughout the hon premier 's opening address . it is definitely a case of keeping one 's hand on it .
if i am to haul things out of the closet , then i would ask the hon members on that side of the house when they are going to apologise for the quattro camps .
they canvassed votes at the polling booths : vote totals such as 4,15 % , 18 % , 13 % , and now i am talking about their total percentage of the vote at sarah le fleur in elsies river .
that the house expresses its thanks to the provincial government and in particular the department of agriculture for their financial assistance to the unemployed during the floods of 2000 at calitzdorp and leeu-gamka .
i would like to thank hon members on this side of the house for their contributions and their support for and understanding of what i set out in my opening address .
the boy 's mother did not believe that her boy would fit in at herzlia and an appointment was made for her to meet with the principal of harold cressy .
anyone who knows anything about schooling in the oppressed community of the western cape will know that harold cressy has a long and very proud tradition of nonracism and nonsectarianism .
the standing committee regards itself as an integral part of the education community in the province and undertakes to support the wced in all education decisions that are educationally justifiable .
we need to develop our links with the regional economies with whose governments we already have strong ties , such as the state governments of germany , austria , the italian regional government , scotland and northern ireland .
the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation has the political responsibility to give leadership to the police service in this province - particularly the moral leadership that must be given .
i would like to thank the hon premier and the speaker of the provincial parliament for allowing sign language interpretation at the opening address of the hon premier .
mr speaker , the key point i am making is that the iec is meant to be an independent structure that runs the elections in this country .
the call we on this side of the house are making to the iec , through rev sampson , is that we should not begin these elections on the wrong foot .
let us not begin a process where the results of the elections can be questioned for their fairness and impartiality before we even go into the elections .
in animal farm , when the animals took over the farm , the pig that became the leader immediately deployed the farmer 's bulldogs to sit next to him .
the western cape cultural commission and the western cape language commission have been established and they have been mandated to manage the budget we will spend on cultural and language issues .
i indicated this in my speech when outlining my key measurable objectives during the hon premier 's 100-day initiative , and i stand by this open-door policy .
sixthly , we need an up-to-date databank , and , seventhly , newspapers and magazines should , at a regular and constant rate , print relevant , standardised informative messages .
what has happened over the past few days also happened in the last parliamentary session - the new np came out defeated and licking their wounds .
the hon premier himself has said - and i agree with him - that the province is better than any other province in terms of resources .
our failing criminal justice system and our under-resourced and demotivated police service hang in limbo while they wait for the national leadership of this country to enforce the rule of law .
some of the areas where business can become partners with the police to combat crime are surveillance equipment , micro-chip tracking systems for vehicles , management skills and training and the provision of motor vehicles .
asking people what they think of the police is , however , not the best way to assess the impact of criminal justice on everyday life .
answering the many questions requires an assessment of the performance of the south african criminal justice system , that cluster of state institutions tasked with enforcing the law .
my question is whether the time is not ripe for the western cape government to involve its church leaders more dynamically in the solution of community and social issues .
i have labelled them - mainly for the benefit of the hon ministers of the new np - because it is really to them that i am making this appeal today .
mr speaker , it is these white afrikaners who have decided that they want to build and contribute to this country and dirty their hands .
] are they aware that there are still children that have to bring chairs from home so that they have something to sit on in the classroom ?
the people that i have just spoken about are the 5 % that i think the hon premier did not even bother to think about .
furthermore , mr speaker , in his address it is very clear that this government , together with the person responsible , is not prepared to establish the youth commission .
mr speaker , it is not much of a miracle for someone to carry on living under the constant threat of falling victim to violent crime .
a new south africa of equality and democracy has been born , with all the pain and joy usually associated with bringing new life into the world .
failure to do this will enslave south africans to fear and ongoing poverty , yet that side of the house talks to us about poverty relief !
in other words , if i follow the legal process correctly , i am in fact being told that i am a criminal , because i am then also subject to this investigation .
i want to tell the hon premier that it is very clear that it is not such wonderful education , because it is education for the white community .
i am particularly pleased that the official heckler is not here today , because , i understand , she is chairing a meeting in bloemfontein or somewhere else .
open and transparent public finances , along with sound , coherent and sustainable macroeconomic and fiscal policies , have ensured that south africa has weathered the storm of the world economic crisis remarkably well .
wesgro has identified these leading sectors as tourism , agriculture and agro-processing , which includes fishing ; professional and design services ; general as well as specialised trade ; metal processing and precision engineering ; and information technology .
mr speaker , despite my confidence in the budget which i am presenting today , we should be mindful of the challenges that await the western cape provincial government .
secondly , we must continue to evaluate new sources of revenue in liaison with the national department of finance , while at the same time developing ways and means of improving the existing sources of own revenue .
i do not know what the arrangements are thus far in terms of the isixhosa edition of the report but i shall give the house feedback in that regard in due course .
i would like to refer them to the opening address of the hon premier where he referred to what he called the most important programme of his government this year , which was voter registration .
mr speaker , we then indicated to the hon minister that we would definitely be asking her further questions because politically we wanted her head in this house !
mr speaker , i do not want to repeat myself , but i want to express our gratitude for the way in which the departments have been represented during the period of the scof meetings .
we would like to know whether equity is being built in at the micro level and whether we are getting value for the money that we are putting into those areas on a non-racial basis .
we do complain that people are coming from other provinces to live here , but i also want to point out to him that in terms of the ffc formula this province pays for that .
but this does not discard the need for all of us to continue committing ourselves to the improvement of the quality of life for all the people of our province .
i think that the western cape is privileged to have the most experienced director-general in the country in the person of dr barnard at the helm of its administrative affairs .
i want to say to the hon member mr n m isaacs that the anc has acquired another string that they can harp on , and that is the business plan .
as regards the accusation - i must correct this today - that i do not have business plans for my portfolios , i should like to make the following remark .
i appeal to hon members of the opposition to confine their arguments to tested facts and not to suck untruths or even lies out of their thumbs .
it would have been the task of the consultant to determine the structure and infrastructure of this portfolio and to develop a policy document on poverty alleviation and a business plan .
over the past year there has been a particular focus on the unbundling and division of certain corporate functions , including finance , at implementation level and their establishment among the larger departments .
although this remains a central function in terms of a cabinet decision , work study functionaries have been allocated to the departments for the execution of projects in an effort to improve service delivery .
we have a responsibility not only to ensure safety and security , but all the departments , including the health department , need to be trained to be gender sensitive .
through outsourcing , privatisation and other forms of public / private partnerships deliver services as efficiently as possible , while ensuring that the state service is not burdened beyond its capacity ;
the previous minister , ms martha olckers , established a strategic management team led by mr craig morkel to compile a report for the establishment of a youth development strategy .
we heard from the hon member ms vantura that people do not know where to report the fact that their children have been raped or otherwise affected .
the cabinet has appointed a task team which will submit its findings to the cabinet within the next month or two ; after that the cabinet will take a further decision in this regard .
is it not long overdue for south africa to declare aids a national emergency , so that the necessary resources and energies can be directed to saving our nation ?
in this regard , i wish to point out to hon members that i have already instructed the law adviser to draft a bill regarding the establishment of a parliamentary service .
i am of the view that the house should appoint an ad hoc committee to draft this legislation , which will also incorporate a code of conduct , as a matter of urgency .
the needs are so diverse , the working methods and structures so mutually alien and the traditions so entirely different that irritation , misunderstanding and confrontation will , sadly , always be our fate .
do hon members realise that if we got all of our former members to sit in the gallery , they would neatly fill the seating , because 36 members have retired to date .
this provincial parliament , being one of the smallest in terms of staff complement , is testimony to good management and adherence to fiscal discipline , unlike others in this country .
madam chairperson , i would like to start by thanking the hon premier , the cabinet and the hon minister of finance and development planning for supporting this increase .
let me at this point immediately add that i am not for one moment suggesting that the speaker is inclined to restrict the powers of committees .
of course , the speaker can give a committee a term of reference and restrict it , but a speaker will have to be very careful not to become involved in party politics .
as the hon member mr williams reasoned , that will , of course , also apply to the powers of the committees if parliament has the power to amend money bills .
mr speaker , i am going to address the question more fully than i would normally have done , because i see there is a speaker 's list on the question .
the hon minister said in his speech that various interested and affected parties were also present at the meeting at the sanp offices .
mr speaker , i wonder whether the concern of the anc is not because certain anc people are involved in certain opportunities offered by the development .
if the developer in this case had heeded my request to him to consult or to speak to the interested and affected parties ...
secondly , if this was supposedly done wearing both hats , why does the hon minister 's office write and say , and i quote :
mr speaker , yesterday the hon leader of the opposition made reference in the house to the fact that this item has been overtraded in debates in the house .
what is the extent of fraudulent use of school reports and what plans are in place to eradicate this fraud ?
this was brought to the attention of the department on 21 november and consent was given at once for the rendering of necessary emergency assistance in that area to be proceeded with .
we refer to it as a tribunal and not a court , as a court may not be created by provincial legislation , but only by national legislation .
( 3 ) like the cost of the damage , the cost of the fire-fighting will be quantified by different agencies , and it is unlikely to be consolidated into a single figure .
it has not redistributed a single cent or a single teacher to a disadvantaged school ; it is a disgrace and history will prove it .
how is it possible that the previous annual report , which was submitted to the hon premier on 28 may 1998 , was tabled in this parliament one month later ?
even if it was an interjection , i would like to appeal to the chair to give a ruling as to whether that is acceptable language when describing another member .
it is neither the sole responsibility nor does my department have the capacity to monitor the implementation of environmental management plans in respect of all coastal and other resorts on behalf of all authorities .
mr speaker , as far as the capacity of my department with regard to eias are concerned , we have increased our capacity from three scientists to eight in the last few months .
mr speaker , could the hon minister of finance and development planning briefly describe the process within the public service when putting forward their candidates for the public service representation on the tender board ?
while the hon minister would like to make a little politics on his side , according to my statistics it would seem as if this is very male and very white .
mr speaker , i can clearly say that in the end i made that decision and i am satisfied that the process that was followed was a correct process .
my instruction to the department is that i will personally approve of any recommendation by the cultural commission and that should give the hon member the answer to her question .
mr speaker , if the hon member will put the question in writing and table it , i will promise him that he will get an answer to it in the next couple of days .
the way the police are handling themselves and the way in which the hon minister pronounces or fails on pronounce on matters does - and perhaps he ought to ...
the fact of the matter is that guguletu police station at this point has more than 100 % capacity , whereas the muizenberg police station is 60 % under capacity .
they also conduct regular market research in the domestic market and interpret satour 's international marketing surveys to assess the visitor 's satisfaction with our facilities and services .
the pawc is also monitoring the implementation process which is quite complicated and has already resulted in legal actions between the developer and the council .
if the questioner would like me to read annexure a , which are the conditions , it is two and a half full typewritten pages .
on 10 february 1999 the west coast district council took a decision to close grotto bay , the section known as small beach , as a swimming beach to vehicles .
golden arrow bus services has a legitimate contract with the government to convey passengers and the drivers are saying , and rightfully so , that they need security on the buses .
after the visit of our delegation to the province shandong , there is now talk of an investment of us $ 74 million to establish a textile factory in the western cape .
mr speaker , the international community , irrespective of the assurances that we are giving , are saying that at one stage they were on the verge of investing in our country .
the international community say that we have again delayed their process into our country , because we have not come out strongly enough on this issue on zimbabwe .
we in this country tend to forget that the honeymoon that everybody contemplated in 1994 is over , and the promises that were made at that time ...
about nine months ago , the farm owner took mr mcotshana to the local doctor every two days for two weeks for treatment to the sores on one of his legs .
although the executive capacty in other departments is in the hands of the provincial minister he or she can only work in the environment created by the central government .
( 2 ) the report tabled in the provincial parliament is a public document and i do not intend making further statements in this regard .
( 1 ) at mincom meetings i have given my assurance to the national minister of transport that the western cape is committed to implementing the be legal campaign .
if that is not acclaim enough , i learned recently that we are also finalists in the prestigious eta award which measures efficiency in the use of power .
( 1 ) the criteria used for the selection of an official banker ( s ) , and which has been approved by the western cape provincial tender board , is as follows :
the hon minister has put in a very broad basket of criteria of whether , for example , a bank supports housing to disadvantaged communities , but it is a very general broad basket of criteria .
mr speaker , businesses in the province are tired of the excuses given by that side of the house in relation to the empowerment of black business .
that dilemma was whether the provincial cabinet was willing or not to accede to the demand that the contracts would be to a limit of r2 million .
i have managed to convince the board to be proactive in appointing the consultant in order to move on without the regulations in place .
however the department of state expenditure which is responsible for persal , has been requested to create a special field on the persal system to accommodate the definition and easy access .
mr speaker , the word " condemnation " is one which i would use in other respects , possibly in regard to other matters which occur in the house .
it must be expected that pass rates at schools where senior certificate learners have consistently absented themselves will be negatively affected , and i expect that impact to be reasonably serious .
this is what happened : the hon minister of community safety and i had a meeting with the executive of the muslim judicial council and the jewish board of deputies .
i extend a special welcome to our new minister of social services and poverty relief , mr david malatsi , who has just been sworn in , as well as to mr charles redcliffe .
then , a special word of thanks to the director-general of this province , dr niel barnard , who guides and manages the province with an expertise few people can deny .
thus , our excellent programme to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hiv / aids will remain in place , and azt will continue to be used so that it can be compared with nevirapine .
the council takes over from the inter-ministerial committee , which was so ably chaired by my colleague mr peter marais , now the mayor of the city of cape town .
i wish to acknowledge the initiatives and stamina of the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works , who kept rural development firmly on the province 's list of priorities .
r12,6 million , also to transport , for the replacement of government motor vehicles whose age and extent of use have rendered them unacceptably costly to maintain .
with regard to the 2000-01 financial year , i am pleased to report a revenue retention of r20,1 million , a portion of which has already been realised and the balance estimated conservatively .
] although he has criticised all the time , there was a chance for him to accept the challenge and work with us , but he did not .
let me remind hon members that this is the only province where we have had two ministers , one of whom is in the office of the premier , to look into poverty relief .
they might have been able to buy the hon member mr mckenzie , and i produced sworn affidavits in this house in that regard , so it is not fallacy .
mr speaker , on a point of order : i think we need to check the hansard and see whether the mumbled words of the hon premier imply a withdrawal or not .
in the meantime , on that basis , we have withdrawn the motion of no confidence for the time being in order to clarify the matter of the secret ballot first through a legal review .
i hope that the measures now introduced will not only give us an interim solution , but that this will also be a long-term solution for the problem .
according to my mind , we have not to date had sufficient impetus from the private sector options that are available , but we are pulling that expertise in .
mr speaker , if the hon member mr isaacs can tell me what school is involved here , i will find out and furnish him with the answer .
( b ) further calls on the minister to approach the business schools at the universities of cape town , the western cape and stellenbosch to assist in such a study .
as part of this drive , the existing procurement system and documentation needs to be simplified so as to make it more understandable to both the private sector and procurement officials in provincial departments .
madam chairperson , more important , regarding information technology in general , we embarked on a two-phase strategy in 1998 to reposition information technology as a critical factor for future success .
one of my party colleagues was sitting and listening to the department of finance present its budget , and asked me , " what are you going to say to that department ?
] i am going to be saying when i speak to the hon minister of finance and development planning as well that there is a wind of change blowing in the new np .
] in this statement there is an acknowledgement that the anc has managed a difficult process and ensured that this country avoided , thanks to the anc , a train smash economically .
this was the only r10 million available to be rolled over into the programme that is aimed at addressing the poverty of the poor .
what it does not do is look at who the people are who are going to provide the casino with food , and who are going to do the signage and that sort of thing .
madam chairperson , i am sorry that the hon member mr ozinsky was not on the speakers ' list - he was absent - because i always love his comments .
then i move on to the hon member mr louis , and confirm once again that i believe that he is totally correct in his motion , as i have said before .
the knock-on cumulative effect is that we have 1 500 officers fewer now than we had in 1994 , which is 45 % under the ideal strength provided .
albeit , may i say , over a longer period of time than one would wish and with a great loss of life and limb in the process .
it is ironic that the recent and future operational action by the saps countrywide , namely joint operations , has been conducted for a long time in this province under the capable command of dirk crafford .
in this area we have one of the most exciting and bold initiatives termed the chrysalis project which is receiving overwhelming support from all , and i will refer to that project in a moment .
i also wish to thank the sandf , especially gen chris van zyl and his staff , for the sterling support he has given throughout and for the adventures still to come .
captain anine de beer on occasion made certain statements with a racist tone , as was later to be the finding , but the hon minister is simply mum about that .
in the western cape tourists have been the unfortunate targets for criminals , but less than 2 % of these crimes have been successfully prosecuted according to the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation .
what cooperation does this department have from social services in policing its homes for the aged and securing a clean bill of health from homes under our provincial aegis .
the course taken by the department of community safety with mini-madam in the manenberg area is , i believe , the best that will in the circumstances guarantee maximum benefits for us in the long term .
the fact of the matter is that if they knew what the cpo contract was about , they would have understood that whoever sponsors the cpos dictates where they go .
the department of justice opened five satellite courts recently , without bothering to approach the police to provide manpower for the security for the prisoners .
the first objective is to promote the development of sport and recreation in this province at all levels , with particular focus on rural and disadvantaged communities , women and the disabled .
we shall also be supporting the safe haven and other sport against crime initiatives and working closely with the department of community safety , especially on the chrysalis project , which will produce sport coaches .
in the coming year my department will once again engage in social upliftment sport programmes , including the summer games , recreation projects , the safe haven projects and community games , which i have already referred to .
our country and our sportsmen and women in fact owe a considerable debt of thanks to the voluntary officials for the unselfish contribution they make to the development of sport and recreation .
we shall not stop doing so while our children are still playing in the streets and children of hon members on that side are enjoying the juice of apartheid .
it is his responsibility to go and sit down with those who are also affected and to come up with a solution to address this issue .
almost more than any other province , we have the infrastructure and human resources and the natural beauty and attractiveness to make the cape a world sporting destination .
i just hope she is not one of those 10 % that the hon minister referred to , who will be sitting in an armchair , relaxedly taking retirement .
in the western cape we strongly believe in multiparty democracy , and welcome the year 2000 as a new canvass on which to paint a bright new future for our young democracy .
i believe that every one of us - each hon member - is keen to see our province work , as much as we would like to see the rest of south africa work .
we should be proud of the fact that unemployment in the western cape is half that of the rest of the country - 17,9 % as against 35 % .
mr speaker , the agreements and joint projects negotiated during the visit prove this point and i am excited to report on them .
furthermore , i have asked the national minister for welfare and population development why the aged persons amendment act passed by parliament in 1998 has not yet been promulgated .
speaking of democracy , i believe that multiparty democracy in south africa , the very democracy which former president nelson mandela said he was prepared to die for , is in jeopardy .
as with the selection of premiers , the anc 's proposed method of choosing mayors can only enhance the powers of patronage of its party chiefs .
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 1 - premier of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1998 [ pr 122 / 1999 ] .
( 3 ) again commits itself to peace and prosperity for all , nation-building and the elimination of racism , where and in whatever degree it may occur .
it is clear that we have to get beyond the politically correct explanations for poor performance , and look at the multi-faceted reasons for failure in all their complexity .
madam chairperson , if all the international literature on quality in education could be distilled , there would be agreement on three essential requirements for good education to take place .
in the year ahead we will also have a focus intervention strategy for grades 10 to 12 , concentrating particularly on schools that we have identified as being " at risk " academically .
i am all in favour of sport in our schools , but it must add value to the core curriculum , not substitute for it as is too often the case .
in order to qualify for support , schools have to commit themselves to a development strategy , starting with the establishment of a school safety committee and a safety plan , which includes training in conflict resolution .
this is essential spending in the current climate , and i do want to pay a sincere tribute to mr eugene daniels and his dedicated team for what they have achieved with this money .
in one case , in a rural context , we came upon a school that with the assistance of parents and members of the community had built a hall for r10 000 .
the western cape education department should therefore weigh the effectiveness of fast-tracking or pacing each of the policy initiatives which they hope to introduce in our schools and colleges .
the other process is the national norms and standards process , which the wced talks about all the time , saying that it is the first department in the country to do it .
then we in this province will be confronted with the demands of transformation , which we should be attending to now but are not doing so , and how we will account for that .
what is worrying , in fact , is that nearly 16 % of the schools in the western cape need special attention because they have not even complied with the very minimum standards .
truly , i think it is about time that the private sector stood together to start encouraging people and taking hands and helping this department to educate people .
in this regard i wish to make an appeal for two specific schools in my part of the world , namely the steynville primary school at piketberg and the schoonspruit secondary school at malmesbury .
in this school they have developed a life-skills programme and are attempting to address hiv / aids , but they need the support of the hon minister .
i am sure the r11 million budget for the hon minister 's safe schools objective is sorely needed , but should not have been necessary .
emphasising the need for a vibrant public school system in no way plays down the importance of the role played by the independent school sector .
the hon minister and the department need to ensure that they put in place an appropriate structure , and that their officials are suitably trained to meet the needs of the schools .
i strongly encourage partnerships that we call twinning , and it is happening everywhere in education at present - the sharing of facilities , sports fields , computers and so on .
unfortunately it is true that over the past few years the health service in our province has been hard hit by scaling down and restructuring , and its public image has been harmed .
with a better budgetary allocation and the various opportunities which present themselves , we now truly have the potential to make a real difference to the health of our people .
this includes my predecessor , dr quarta du toit , who last year spoke passionately on behalf of hiv-infected children and for the availability of azt for pregnant mothers .
it should be noted too that the region spends a considerable amount of its own service expenditure on hiv / aids services , which are an integral part of its district and regional level services .
what concerns me , however , is the department 's tb cure rates , projected to increase from 68 % to 80 % , while hiv infection rates are also expected to increase significantly .
i would also like to mention the decline in the admittance of people to academic hospitals by 2,1 % - 4,4 % in regional hospitals and 4,41 % in district hospitals .
what i found remarkable is the fact that this change has led to an increase in the number of patients who use primary health care services , that is , community health care centers or clinics .
- comprehensive restructuring of rehabilitation services at all levels , but geared primarily towards a community-based system , with active participation of communities , people with disabilities , and all those who require rehabilitation support and their families .
as young children are especially vulnerable and dependent on their mothers , they need special protection and support at all times , especially in times of conflict , natural disasters and economic hardship .
madam chairperson , i have read this letter because i want to bring this house to an awareness of the crisis that exists in our hospitals , especially regarding the pharmaceuticals .
the hon minister said then that a provincial hiv / aids council would be appointed and he would soon announce the name of the person to head it .
the business plan specifically stated , and i am still referring to this report , that it was not the intention of the department to lose any staff from psychiatric hospitals .
madam chairperson , on a point of order : the hon minister is having a dialogue with hon members and not replying to the entire house .
just to give hon members an idea of what is happening in the western cape , there are 357 480 households living in poverty in the western cape .
social services in the past two years has been the establishment of an after-hours service for children who are victims of abuse .
in the case of a disaster a one-off amount of r500 is paid to disaster victims - this has been discussed in this house before - if funds are available .
it is of course important that a representative disaster victim committee be appointed to supervise the allocation of money as we saw , for example , in the case of manenberg .
this assumption therefore indicates that a desk for poverty relief will function on precisely the same basis as the other desks in my office , namely interdepartmentally , intersectorally and multidisciplinarily .
currently one ngo is being financed for service delivery to persons living with the disease at a cost of r50 914 , which secures the services of social workers and administrative assistants .
there are a whole range of other departments that should be enhancing the life of that family - it is not only the child support grant that should be given .
as explained to us in standing committee , it is these very circumstances that have led to the delay in spending the r10 million earmarked for poverty relief .
consultants were advertised for , but before the interviews could take place the minister was relieved of his duties resulting in the stoppage or delay of the interview process .
this is only going to be magnified by the nearly 2 000 daily aids infections in this country , which will result in many more children without parents that will ultimately end up on the streets .
this lack of funds does not limit the promotion of the gender equality programme and existing personnel have already embarked upon the planning phase for the programme .
i am also proud to announce that the housing project in klapmuts has been nominated in the category , world 's best practice , in the habitat 2000 competition that will be held in dubai .
one has people staying in a flat for 40 years or 50 years - even 60 years in kewtown - but they cannot even dream about ownership .
many of them live in shacks on our farms or in the growing number of squatter camps on our rural towns , where people look for accommodation when they have been chased off the farms .
i would be failing in my duty if i did not bring the lot of some of the residents of amstelhof in paarl to the attention of the hon minister .
if that hon member had listened to my address , he would have heard me say that we are sitting with project applications worth r765 million for which we have no money .
the hon minister has given us a broad overview of his strategic objectives , against which we shall measure him and criticise him constructively , so that he can eventually reach whatever his goals are .
] according to the hsrc , it is clear that if an election took place today , the new np would have fewer members in this house than the dp .
if any house catches fire in any area that is not a white area , there is not one fire-vehicle that can get there in less than 12 minutes .
the other discordant note that we have heard in the house from time to time has come from the ring-leader of the self-appointed guardians of democratic values , the hon minister of education .
madam chairperson , i am glad about the cooperation of the municipalities and i am also glad that it appears that the new np has also developed new insights now .
the reality is that everyone in this house knows that to deliver services at a local government level , one needs a provincial government that represents all the people .
i can tell hon members what he would have said , " how can you table a provincial bill in the house when a national law is on the way ?
in both the metropolitan area and the non-metropolitan area people want to proceed with the general valuation , but they have to make use of the old general valuation of this province of 1993 .
i should also mention that transformation and diversity management workshops have been conducted for all staff in the department to address the culture of the department and chief directorate .
in the forthcoming financial year , we shall continue to promote and monitor the idp process and to assess the idfs which have already been completed and submitted to the department .
accordingly it is the earnest appeal of the new np that the officials in the department increase their involvement and support to the areas in question on an ongoing basis during the period of transformation .
let me start by saying immediately that the key concern to me in this department is still the total lack of transformation , especially in the senior management corps .
we have the figures by post level , and i want to concentrate on the senior management echelon , which i have defined - people may want to debate this - as assistant director and higher .
there is a distinction between a pdc , which represents civil society views , and an organisation like wesgro or the tourism board , which are there simply for tourism or business promotion .
in fact , two of the matters that i will be taking on review came about based on court judgments that were given after the dassenberg decision had been taken .
i stick to that and will leave it to the hon member mr ozinsky to quote from my hansard next year , if i am still in this position .
i had the view then , as i said at a press conference today , that there were planning officials sitting here at province who had horns growing from their foreheads .
this constitutes a paradigm shift in the governance of environmental affairs insofar as it makes the welfare of our people the central point of departure in the administration of the environment .
we shall also look at creating awareness of issues concerning the cleaning up of the environment , and linking this with the creation of employment opportunities in greening , waste management and recycling .
the initiatives and plans briefly sketched here will form part of a longer-term strategy of creating a sustainable environment for the people of the western cape .
the principal vehicles for these changes are the cultural commission and the language committee , which mark the beginning of an era of democratic and representative governance in the cultural affairs of the western cape .
i understand the commission is also busy with the revision of the existing policy on funding in order to make recommendations to the hon minister in this regard .
secondly , environmental education should encourage people to become involved in environmental issues at appropriate levels , even if this simply means that people will keep their homes and immediate environment clean .
this is a serious matter , because if the hon minister is being marginalised , then the department becomes marginalised and the issues that the department is dealing with also become marginalised .
mr chairperson , to begin with i want to thank the officials of the department of environmental and cultural affairs for the work they are doing with the limited budget at their disposal .
all the various departments in their budgets should integrate in their programmes a culture of learning , a culture of tolerance , a culture of human rights and a culture of non-violence .
it is the first time since i became a member of the provincial parliament that people have come to speak to me and have told me : " madam , we have no work .
i am hoping that the culture of short interjections will eventually take root on both sides of the house by the time we have practised enough of this kind of interjection .
in clause 14 , page 6 , line 21 after the words " responsible minister " , we request that the words " after consultation with the board " be inserted .
the department 's support of the provincial aids awareness programme is visible on the national routes in the cape metropolitan area , and this awareness campaign is to expand to the rural areas shortly .
i may just mention that the national minister of transport has complimented the western cape in this regard by holding up this figure as an example at the last minmec meeting .
works has just performed an extensive audit on all our buildings with the main purpose of creating a data base in which the state and condition of buildings and infrastructure are captured .
firstly , there is the metropolitan transport authority ; secondly , the provision of maintenance and transport infrastructure ; thirdly , the generation of own revenue ; and , lastly , the aspect of toll-roads , which is critical .
last year we were of the opinion - and especially the acdp - that we were steamrollering toll-roads and we wanted to have a more inclusive approach .
i made the point in september , 1999 , in answer to the hon minister 's 100-day vision speech , that as long as they moved in a fragmented way , they were heading for a train smash .
the critical question that troubles our mind in the anc is how the provincial department 's budget can contribute to job creation and the skills development of poor people , both black and white .
] i would like to end by saying that we will continue to give our support to the processes addressing the problems in the public transport system .
we received a letter from his office - one with a fine badge - on 25 september 1998 in which they say , and i quote :
madam chairperson , the anc will not cease to fight to address the key issues of poverty , unemployment and the effective combating of crime by making the state the centre point .
that is just the point we are making when we speak about contracting out work for contract workers , smmes and developing and even established black civil contractors along the west coast .
had it not been for the political will and the intervention of politicians , v3 would have persisted in saying that this was impossible to do - and the lights are burning .
it is evident that the department and the ministry did not devote sufficient attention to them to ensure that we could for example see the realisation of that road .
i am also pleased to see that some of this money has been allocated to the emergency work urgently needed to make chapmans peak drive useable .
i believe that there are certain timing problems regarding the implementation of this new system and that perhaps it might not be in place by the end of this year .
madam chairperson , if the hon member mr ismail thinks that everything is a joke , he should never again stand up in the house and talk on behalf of poor people .
( 2 ) whether any companies on this list have been given contracts ; if so , ( a ) how many and ( b ) what is the total value of such tenders ;
( 3 ) whether any companies on the list awarded provincial contracts have defaulted on contracts ; if so , ( a ) how many and ( b ) why ?
the process of bringing new and upcoming contractors into this sphere of contracting for public transport is part of his own policy , which he wrote in his term of office .
i know of a company at vredendal - and the hon member mr fransman will know about this - that equipped a whole series of their vehicles with personal number-plates .
in these instances a motion must be worded in the clearest terms and without adjectives , and the cooperation of the whole house is requested ; then we support it .
to deal with it effectively will require a hard look at the causes of the loss of almost 1 million jobs in the formal economy since 1994 .
firstly , the hassle factor and the cost for businesses to dismiss workers have become simply too big , as has been found by a recent study by the world bank in gauteng .
they employ progressive labour practices involving widespread use of team work , constant competence development of the workforce and a bonus system , making the employees partners of the success .
hon members will be familiar with the course of events that led to the ruling of the constitutional court on the constitutionality of the national liquor bill on 11 november last year .
this is combined with the developing of a database of information for all stakeholders within the tourism industry , for example , data on facilities and attractions to use for inter alia market research purposes .
what really excites me is that - no names no pack-drill - the companies that applied for operator status are the first line of global convention centre operators .
over the past two years wesgro achieved phenomenal success in both areas , securing in excess of r1,5 billion in new investment and creating 2 500 direct jobs .
khula has made r20 million available as loan capital - in fact , capital to be loaned - for such a fund that will serve the western , eastern and the northern cape provinces .
" it is always a bottom-line approach , and for the past seven years i have been debating this whole issue of drafting policies with the hon minister .
why are we not sponsored to go to harvard or to ensued in paris , or to the london business school , to be trained to be at the cutting edge ?
how can we be prepared to tackle the world if our fibre optics are not of a capacity to download information at a very fast rate ?
for that reason the new np is also grateful - although not yet satisfied - that we have an unemployment rate of 14 % as against the national unemployment rate of approximately 37 % .
the textile and clothing industry is going through a difficult phase , but we shall also have to look at other manufacturing industries such as stainless steel , iron and steel , and perhaps at chemically related industries too .
these key initiatives include the cape gateway project and the open skies , and the venture capital initiatives driven by the department of trade and industry for all the three cape provinces .
apart from the fact that the cape town convention centre is unrepresentative of the people of this province , we want to ask again : is there a conflict of interests in the convention centre ?
i would like to congratulate the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism and his department on the outstanding budget and contribution that they are making to the economy of the province .
madam chairperson , it is almost impossible to hold a normal conversation in her lounge , or for her children to study as the noise is so intrusive .
many of the successes that the hon minister identified came about , in fact , through the very hard work of wesgro as an institution , and we would like to congratulate them on that .
it is a bare-faced , contemptible , racist document and i am shocked that a person who carries his responsibility here was prepared to issue anything of the kind on human rights day .
madam chairperson , the hon member mr e isaacs made valid remarks about megaprojects and about tourism and also supported the need to enforce liquor licences fully .
however , our agriculture cannot escape the inherent risks of this industry , as has been vividly illustrated during the past 12 months of fires and flood disasters .
mr chairperson , it therefore makes sense to invest in a sector that can provide for the future , and to provide the infrastructure for growth within that sector .
in 1999 we harvested 1,5 million tonnes of wheat as against the 2,5 million that was necessary , but as a result of the dumping the price is lower than it was three years ago .
i do not think we shall make a farmer of him , but we can make him a very good agricultural economist , and for the agricultural industry at least that is going to mean a great deal .
in this regard i also wish to challenge those hon members : let us challenge the other provinces and see who does the most for farm workers over the next five years .
in the western cape we strongly believe in multiparty democracy , and welcome the year 2000 as a new canvass on which to paint a bright new future for our young democracy .
i believe that every one of us - each hon member - is keen to see our province work , as much as we would like to see the rest of south africa work .
we should be proud of the fact that unemployment in the western cape is half that of the rest of the country - 17,9 % as against 35 % .
mr speaker , the agreements and joint projects negotiated during the visit prove this point and i am excited to report on them .
furthermore , i have asked the national minister for welfare and population development why the aged persons amendment act passed by parliament in 1998 has not yet been promulgated .
speaking of democracy , i believe that multiparty democracy in south africa , the very democracy which former president nelson mandela said he was prepared to die for , is in jeopardy .
as with the selection of premiers , the anc 's proposed method of choosing mayors can only enhance the powers of patronage of its party chiefs .
that is as it ought to be because we must not allow politics to intervene in a negative way in the transportation of people because political bodies support the riotous actions of disturbers of the peace .
before we deal with the bill , i would like to express my gratitude to every member of the standing committee on economic development , which had to react very quickly to finalise the legislation .
let us say , for instance , that a car is not legally impounded and the person driving it to the pound did not have permission to do so .
these communities are poor enough without the thug tactics shown by the taxi associations that are stopping commuters from getting the transport service they choose , need and deserve .
i must , however , just point out that we do acknowledge that the taxi industry does have a major role to play in the public transport system and the economy as a whole .
in this way the public may take cognisance of the intention of the minister and his department to declare unrest areas where unrest is caused by minibus taxis or other transport agencies .
mr speaker , it is a pity that the hon member mr dugmore says that the constitution made provision for getting rid of the hon member mr ramatlakane .
the few cannot to dictate to others , saying why they should not apply for business in the area , or why golden arrow should stay out .
mr speaker , the powers that the hon minister was given include declaring a road or rank as being closed , or deciding on the period of postponement .
sir , before responding to the speeches by the speakers , i should like to refer to the amendment bill , and specifically to article 30b , " extraordinary measures for declared areas " .
justice means punishment to fit the crime and i say the only punishment that fits the crime of ruthless murderers is the hangman 's noose .
if soldiers from any hostile nation cross our border and murder or rape our women will we spare their lives and put them in nice comfortable jails with colour tvs ?
not only are they our responsibility as vulnerable members of society , but they represent our future productive potential , ie scientists , economists , teachers , artists and so on .
people 's rdp houses are being bought from them by these dealers , children are getting trapped in the web of cheap drugs and the youth in the towns are beginning to organise themselves into gangs .
after she was killed the chairperson or vice-chairperson of that cpf , who happens to be an executive member of the anc , started a project called safer streets .
when this matter was discussed during the meetings of heads , mr o ' connell said inter alia that it was examination time and we would not be able to use all the teachers .
it was very clear to me that the anc members of the committee were geared not to accept the answers of the director-general but rather to play power politics in regard to this matter .
let me tell the hon member mr strachan that if he found there is anything , he should come to the house and ask for a committee to investigate .
mr speaker , on a point of order : is it in order for an hon member to read a magazine that has nothing to do with the matter under discussion ?
the bill before us clearly deals with the authorisation of expenditure incurred to assist the iec in the voter registration process prior to the national elections in june 1999 .
mr speaker , i want to highlight the issue of the obtaining of legal advice , because the chairperson of the standing committee mentioned this and it deserves repetition .
if all the hon ministers , as the cabinet , have delegated the responsibility to the hon minister of finance and development planning , he will have to respond to the questions on each vote .
madam chairperson , with the deepest of respect , if my memory serves me correctly the hon minister of finance and development planning in his reply mentioned that approximately 787 000 voters were registered .
there is a programme which i have already approved in order that not only officials but also the house be trained in so far as the pfma is concerned .
madam chairperson , it was , as the hon minister says , a broad cabinet decision and he forgot the details about health because he was not the minister then .
madam chairperson , my department employs quite a few thousand people - if i have to watch what everyone is doing , i should stop being a minister .
madam chairperson , there is an official here , but as far as i am concerned , i myself will not take the advice from officials here because of the type of questions that are being asked .
to put the record straight , this money will be reimbursed to health - if the hon member would pick up the document that will be put to the house soon .
madam chairperson , yes , there was a clear instruction to the department of health that health services should be accorded priority and that no services may be affected as a result of this service .
is the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs therefore saying that he may , wittingly or unwittingly , have failed his department , the environment and so forth because he did not ...
madam chairperson , given the exemplary reply to this , is the hon minister of transport and works not afraid that he is embarrassing his colleagues ...
the bitter fruits of 48 years of apartheid minority government have ruled out the extreme that government can rule only for the few , the rich and the privileged .
tourists will come to our mountain , whether the anc or the da governs the western cape , but they will stay away when threatened by the pathology of crime .
if he claims credit for 23 % of the new jobs in the country , he then claims , by implication , that he does control the prospects for jobs .
the hon leader of the opposition is correct , as the hon premier pointed out , that our challenge is to improve the lives of all the people in this province .
mr speaker , if the hon leader of the opposition lacks confidence in this government , then he must be truly dismayed at the performance of the national government .
" south africans are disappointed because they thought that by now they would be enjoying the fruits of development , but now i have a strong hope that this will happen .
in wale street , on the steps in front of the building and in this house specifically , once again today , a banner was hung up in view of all of us .
it has been achieved despite , " hang murderers and rapists " , " no mercy for criminals " , " nail them , jail them " , and " tackle crime " .
perhaps he feels under pressure , perhaps it is the power ratio between the two of them , or perhaps it is the case that it was not worked out too carefully de jure as opposed to de facto .
the highest court in the land has lambasted the provincial government , the da-controlled cmc and the oostenberg municipality for failing to honour ...
i have my own speech to make and i do not want to be diverted , but quite frankly i must make some comments on the previous speaker .
although we no longer have constituencies , we refer to this as constituency responsibility , and i am privileged to be able to include crossroads within the area for which i have constituency responsibility ; ...
speaking personally , mr speaker , the greatest irony is that having worked in crossroads regularly for 25 years i am for the first time under threat there .
a post level 1 teacher , an entry level teacher , may serve as an ordinary councillor , provided that this does not in any way interfere with the educator 's school time , duties and responsibilities .
mr speaker , the hon premier went on to say that the unicity and other municipal authorities would be approached with a view to fast-tracking the programme .
in spite of the fact that things seem to be in a bit of a shake-up as far as offices are concerned , this does not detract from the warm reception i received .
in fact , it was a pleasure being involved in the local government elections in the south peninsula for the da where we won 13 out of 13 wards .
what is more appalling is the deafening silence from president mbeki and the anc on the absolute lawlessness that is happening in that country .
it is calculated that in the western cape alone 300 000 ewes are lost annually to stock thefts - a ewe is a sheep without horns , but with two teats .
] they were not incited to leave the farm , they decided to do so of their own accord and they sought assistance from the anc at piketberg .
let me get to the second incident , which underscores the fact that reality does not accord with the perceptions that the hon premier tried to create here yesterday .
it was not only a case of control of the most desirable city in africa , but also the chance to reinforce positions with a view to future elections .
i would like to emphasise that our efforts to find cheaper drugs are aligned with the accelerated access initiative of the world health organisation , backed by the world 's major pharmaceutical companies .
we hear through the grapevine - and i am not going to say exactly what we have heard - that there are thoughts of allocating it for other functions .
mr speaker , hon members know that for the last four years the anc has been raising that precise question - in what areas are resources being put to fight crime ?
madam chairperson , i would like to know when the environmental commissioner would be appointed , given that we have appropriated money for this person in two years and he / she does not exist .
( 1 ) the alleged involvement of the former chief executive officer and the former head of administration , who is also a senior new np council member of the moorreesburg new np town council ;
we believe that there is a degree of improper or inappropriate action that is taking place outside , which will compound the problems of public transport to which we are trying to find a solution .
she managed to find and board a bus at 07 : 15 , and at 08 : 15 we were still sitting in a traffic jam on the n2 .
why did he call us to the house to debate this when we are supposed to be in our constituencies to deal with the masses ?
however , we must say that if the hon minister had done what he said he would do , then perhaps we would not be participating in this debate once again .
accordingly , mr speaker , legal opinion was obtained on the need for enabling legislation even before the agreement was entered into , and the answer was that such a step was very strongly recommended .
today 's step , our legislation , is therefore aimed not only at regulating the participation of the province , but also at ensuring better controls on the part of the province .
in durban , for example , in about 8 000 m  they can have 23 different configurations , which means that one can have any type of configuration one 's particular conference demands .
thus , the forecast of a r1 billion a year income for the province in a few years from now for the international convention and exhibition centre is not unrealistic .
we should not lose sight of the fact that the initial stages will not only provide jobs , but also opportunities for entrepreneurs in the small and medium business sectors .
i want to convey my sincere thanks to the officials on behalf of the members of the new np for their open-heartedness and the way in which they have taken the committee through the entire process .
that is the point that we raised in the standing committee , that the standing committee was not allowed to fully investigate and debate the shareholders ' agreement .
before the hon member mr silke begins to speak , i would like to appeal to hon members to have understanding for the fact that he is currently beset by flu .
in order to market cape town we will need to be aggressive and dynamic , but we are likely to be at a competitive advantage due to the modern and advanced state of the new facility .
mr speaker , suddenly , in a mind-blowing move on the part of committee members , the standing committee did not authorise the shareholding , because cabinet had that prerogative .
mr speaker , this document supersedes the first document , and in the first document the province is defined correctly - " province " means " province of the western cape " .
for accuracy she should also say that she , our legal people and i had lengthy interactions in the standing committee on a great many of the issues which she raised .
mr speaker , the hon member made a big song and dance about the position of my colleague the hon minister of finance and development planning , who is a director of companies .
( i ) provincial treasury replies to the report of the standing committee on public accounts , 1999 ( announcements , tablings and committee reports no.11-1999 dated 31 may 1999 ) ;
vote 9 - social services ( auditor-general 's report [ pr100 / 1999 - pages 4 and 5 , paragraph 3.3 ( a ) ] ) : transfer payments : possible unauthorised expenditure
vote 16 - transport and public works ( auditor-general 's report [ pr 87 / 1999 - page 14 , paragraph 3.14 ( a ) ] ) : post balance sheet events , unauthorised expenditure
the committee , nevertheless , wishes to recommend that the transport branch of the administration institute a system whereby the utilisation of all government motor transport vehicles is monitored in order that cost effective allocation of the vehicles can be considered on an ongoing basis .
report of standing committee on governmental affairs and community safety , on the western cape determination of types of municipalities bill [ b10-2000 ] , dated 20 june 2000 , as follows :
i am sure the issue will be debated here , because i have also taken cognisance of a letter from the anc about certain aspects that are not being accommodated here .
this was followed by a green paper in october 1997 , and the process culminated in the white paper on local government , published by the national government in march 1998 .
the success story in developed countries such as postwar germany , japan , canada and america are well-known and were developed through the election of skilled council members and effective service delivery at local government level .
it could also have a further negative effect on the submission and adoption of the budgets of local authorities and the allocation of funds in terms of the municipal integrated development planning .
we believe that local government would be far better served by ensuring that proportionality in the executive committee remains and that there is no chance of political domination .
we will not be lectured by parties who spurned the talents of an ismail mahomed and who now in an obscene way come here and pay tribute to those talents .
i say , not with respect but with sadness , that i believe that the allan boesak case is not one in which the legal system left it in the lurch .
a second question for me is whether the transformation agenda is on the table for that institution , in that they make sure they appoint people who have transformation in mind .
i can tell hon members that i myself was unhappy when the policeman who shot dead in his cell the person who had raped his child , was given such a severe sentence .
( c ) notes the constant attacks by the dp on their coalition partner in the province and the effective banning of counter attacks on the dp by the premier ;
the hon premier is not present in the house and i think people must know that on a friday there are only nine or ten nationalists in the house .
the hon minister of transport and works , the hon member mr marais and i became involved in politics at the same time , way before the other coloureds became involved .
we decided to give f w de klerk a chance , because at that time the whites had deserted him for the right wing , the conservative party .
therefore , peter marais is correct when he says , " i have a score to settle with the dp , " and we will support him in settling that score .
indeed , what we have seen is the growing humiliation of the new np and the absolute arrogance of the dp , and we have just seen a fine display of this .
mr speaker , i want to know whether the hon minister is aware that it is not only the dp that has lured away the council members of the new np .
mr speaker , on a point of clarity : i wish to tell the hon member mr dugmore that just as there are two abe williamses , there are also two piet meyers .
given an opportunity , she applied for a home loan , with much enthusiasm and excitement , finally able to have access to property in this country .
the smmes have been fooled into believing that something genuine will be done for them by the dp , and more especially the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism .
the focus of the motion is on the role of the provincial coalition government and its role in preparing policy that will promote smmes , particularly previously disadvantaged individuals .
the whole financial sector as a sector is in serious need of transformation if we , as previously disadvantaged people - and blacks in particular - want to make a serious impact on the economic front .
he then finds himself in a vicious circle where because he does not have money , he has defaulted and he does not get money because he is a defaulter .
mr speaker , i should like to ask you just to find out whether he is still a member of the provincial parliament , just to clarify this uncertainty .
( 1 ) expresses its concern about the lack of a common approach by all spheres of government to the critical economic development of small , medium and micro enterprises ;
secondly , we believe that from time to time , in the interests of inflation , it will be necessary to increase the bid amounts and this we have done .
when we objected to the unfair rating in the system , the dp council of cape town did nothing to assist the poor people in this matter .
madam speaker , we on this side of the house want to protect the rights of those who own property , and extend property rights to those who do not .
usually the victims were killed , not because of resistance offered by them , but apparently just for the sake of killing them or to eliminate them as witnesses .
if it appears necessary to expand the powers of the commando system to protect our agriculturists in the rural areas , then the government must provide the necessary resources .
yesterday afternoon on radio sonder grense agri sa announced that last year there were 813 attacks on farmers , representing an increase of 5,7 % on 1998 .
this society must be understood in the context of maslow 's theory that before the basic needs of the poorest of the poor are addressed , the social evils will continue .
the hon member mr a j williams in introducing this debate mentioned that it was not only the farmers who were affected by this , but also farm workers .
the report of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling on the western cape eighth gambling and racing amendment bill [ b11-2000 ] , dated 4 september 2000 , reads as follows :
the knowledge and experience gained in turn has assisted us in identifying loopholes and other deficiencies in the existing law , culminating in the amendment bill .
it is foreseen that over time the taxes to be collected from these casinos will have an extremely positive impact on the budget of the province .
before i see the next hon member , the technicians are indicating that the volume has been set very high at one or two of the benches and this is causing a distortion .
mr speaker , i want to thank the gambling board , who have over the past three years closed down 333 illegal operations and confiscated more than 5 000 gambling machines in the western cape .
mr speaker , ratepayers , citizens , civic organisations and councillors across party lines have been complaining for years about irregularities in the land use and building survey directorates of the nnp-controlled south peninsula municipality .
the new np is now , unfortunately , showing their voters and the people of the south peninsula that they cannot effectively govern one of the smallest municipalities in this country .
then there is an allegation that the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism is a director and shareholder in a number of hotels and restaurants , which is factually incorrect .
] i have been available to speak on this matter at any time and i will speak on any programmes at any time , both in the house and outside the house .
it does not help to keep saying that the perpetrators are known , while those perpetrators are continuing with their bombing and nothing is done to them .
intelligence agents , old and new , combined under a collective leadership , national and provincial , to deliver a stunning victory to all parties and organs of state - intelligence , police and judiciary .
the perpetrators of these acts of violence seem set on causing as much damage as possible to the lives and livelihood of our people in the western cape .
that is why i believe , whoever these people are - and they have not made any demands - one cannot enter into discussions with them .
i have , therefore , made a pledge to work together with the national government and all the law enforcement agencies to make the western cape a safe place to live in .
( a ) the provincial cabinet be reconstituted to include black south africans ; ( b ) the representation of the coalition parties in the house include black south africans ; and
as long as one supports the anc , is blindly loyal to the president , preferably has enough melanin in one 's skin and an x chromosome , one qualifies for a prestigious and powerful job .
the recent conference on racism hosted by the human rights commission should have been an honest attempt to identify and tackle enduring incidents of racial tension or discrimination .
instead , it became a platform for the anc to take swipes at the opposition , the media and other critical independent voices of civil society .
mr speaker , the anc is further closing many of the doors of political , economic and cultural advancement one by one in the face of minorities .
i come from a political party that has a proud tradition in supporting non-racialism and i will continue to uphold this principle in all aspects of my life .
mr speaker , unfortunately , the problem with the issue under debate is that we are still in the mode of debating whether there is an issue to debate .
what is in dispute is the model of transformation that is rammed down our throats by the anc and so poorly articulated by the hon member mr byneveldt who , ...
it is sad to see the vision of the new south africa backsliding into puerile and juvenile political games of the manner put before the house today .
mr speaker , we must recognise racism for what it is - a scourge that negatively affects our whole country and which we must all work together to eradicate .
( 4 ) thanks all officials in the directorate : examination for their share in the preparation of the matric examination , and wishes them good luck with the administration of the examination ; and
the consequences of such disservice to the country are aptly illustrated by the appalling situation in which our neighbour , zimbabwe , now finds itself as a direct result of such behaviour .
this motion before us is typical of gross generalisations by the anc as part of their reracialisation and divide and rule policy .
in order to change it now , the whole house would have to agree to it and it would have to be a motion of order , which the hon member mr dugmore can move if he wants to .
actions took place without any negligence ; the province did not suffer any damage as a result thereof ; remedial steps have been taken to prevent re-occurrence ; and exceptional circumstances prevailed ,
the tender board was , however , not prepared to grant ex post facto approval as it was considered questionable whether the expenditure had been in the best interest of the state .
actions took place without negligence ; the province did not suffer any damage as a result thereof ; remedial steps have been taken to prevent a re-occurrence ; and exceptional circumstances prevailed ,
( b ) all similar cases , notwithstanding the department 's opinion that the relevant expenditure is unauthorised or not , without exception be submitted to the tender board for its formal ratification .
report of the standing committee on education , environmental and cultural affairs , on the adult basic education and training bill [ b42b-2000 ] ( ncop ) , dated 9 october 2000 , as follows :
formal agreements were entered into between the seller ( development board : house of representatives ) and the purchaser with the proviso that a monthly r5 administration fee be paid to the board ;
actions took place without any negligence ; the province did not suffer any damage as a result thereof ; remedial steps have been taken to prevent a re-occurrence ; and exceptional circumstances prevailed ;
( b ) all similar cases , notwithstanding the department 's view that the relevant expenditure is unauthorised or not , without exception be submitted to the tender board for its formal response .
vote 13 - local government ( auditor-general 's report [ pr 88 / 2000 - page 2 , paragraph 2.2.1 ( a ) ] ) : unauthorised expenditure : election costs : r2 190
the committee has taken note of the circumstances which gave rise to the unauthorised expenditure and recommends that the amount of r2 190 be authorised by the provincial parliament .
firstly , during the committee stage the chairperson of committees allowed the questioners first to give extended opinions about the merits of the budget instead of putting the questions .
mr speaker , i concede that members ' freedom of speech in any debate must be balanced against the dignity of their actions and the stature of the house .
the other hon minister who did very well is the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism , mainly because he did not have to say anything .
last year - if the hon member can recall that - the anc objected to summonsing the national minister of safety and security to this house .
surely they are entitled to ask questions - three , four or twenty questions each - but what is the purpose in a committee stage of asking questions ?
may i start off with perhaps the greatest priority of my speech - to advise the house that it is dr j c stegmann 's birthday today ?
as undertaken , we have managed to speed up our debt redemption considerably , in line with the agreement reached between this government and the national ministry of finance .
] we outlined our position as early as 1955 , in the freedom charter , where we stated that south africa belongs to all who live here - black and white .
there is no doubt that creating common ground and finding workable solutions to intractable problems are far more difficult tasks than endless ideological posturing and partisan attacking .
mr speaker , in the recent local government elections the anc won 72 % of the vote nationally , and 86 % of local government councils nationally are controlled by the anc .
he seems to put all the blame on the da for prostitutes arriving there , drugs and whatever else he says is connected with casinos .
whilst i do not always win in debate with him , the results that come out of that mean that a voice for the western cape is heard at the finance table .
south african politics has now not only cemented the beginnings of a two-party system , but it has given all of us in the western cape a unique opportunity to make a difference .
mr speaker , the hon member mr dugmore was just about the only person in their ranks who tried to give the direction expected of a debate at this level .
that brings the importance of the grootboom case to the foreground , because mr justice davis said that we were obliged to provide accommodation for these people , as long as the funds were available .
there was an average turnover of about 50 % in the african areas , and an extremely low turnout in the coloured areas , that the da mayoral candidate claims to represent in the council .
now is the time to get down and continue and build on the work we began in 1999 and 2000 .
the hon premier said that no one in this province should feel that he could not give a helping hand under the government of this country and this province .
mr speaker , in his opening address the hon premier spelt out the province 's priorities , and it is an honour for me to commit my department and myself to those priorities .
in other words , he created the situation himself ; he did not take an example of something that had actually happened during the election , and the word ...
sir , as long ago as when the wards were being demarcated they promised me that they were going to win the unicity , and that hon member was with them at the city council .
- i am coming to that - unfair dismissals , labour practices , and problems regarding social welfare grants , and we are even in court when child molesters or women abusers appear in court .
we must not speak about racism - they do not want us to do that - and the race card is once again very subtly played .
one of the reasons they advanced - and there were various reasons - was that they were not going to take part because it was not an executive mayoral system .
therefore calls on the premier to reprimand councillor iversen , to make a statement on the matter and to ensure that soccer can be played at newlands .
mr speaker , it was clear from the contributions that this side of the house understood my opening address better than some hon members on that side of the house .
i am talking about men and women who come to the western cape in the hope of finding work , but find themselves living in shacks along the n2 instead .
mr speaker , our guiding philosophy is simple - where there is no opportunity , we intervene to extend to our people a helping hand .
i wonder if the hon leader of the opposition has the courage to acknowledge that the western cape government delivers to the poor like no other government in south africa .
i would like to wish the few hon members staying behind in the province all of the best - i hope they enjoy their work - and the others bon voyage .
] hon members all know , i am not surprised , that president mbeki raised the issue of racism in parliament and quoted at length from an extremely racist engineer .
because one mother does not want her child to mix with muslims does not mean that the jewish community is opposed to mixing with muslims .
the fundamental premise of humanism is that mankind is basically good and that government policy is no longer to determine what is right , but what is popular .
great ceremony , the shaking of hands , the exchange of good wishes , the flashing of cameras , and then , naturally , of course , the opening address of the hon premier - yes , the provincial parliament has been well and truly opened .
in that scientific poll 95 % of the respondents in the western cape who were interviewed indicated that they would prefer to remain in the western cape .
some of our dearest comrades gave their lives in that struggle while the opposite side of the house was defending apartheid and an unconstitutional regime .
these institutions are independent , and subject only to the constitution and the law , and they must be impartial and must exercise their powers and perform their functions without fear , favour or prejudice .
though our economic affairs are in the hands of the dp , our coalition partner , the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism is trying his best to make a success of it .
we all have to be discreet in the way that we use newspapers and magazines in the house , so as not to reflect on the dignity of the house .
mr speaker , i apologise if the impression was given to the house or the hon member mr isaacs that i was reading the newspaper .
we have shown today that if a black man loses his eye , it is not necessary for the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation to do anything about it .
] i am so glad that the hon member said that because i had it written down with the notes for the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism .
mr speaker , they cannot sit on the other side of the house without feeling guilty because they are part of selling out their community .
he created the impression that officials in the offices of the director-general and the premier were going to take over the work physically from the iec and the department of home affairs .
we would like to see a provincial government committed to helping our schools and not claiming the number one position without working for it .
he phoned the police to report the crime and was told that they could not send anyone as they had no vehicle on standby .
the labour force of about 1,8 million increases by some 40 thousand annually , with unemployment currently at about 17 % , compared to the national level of 28 % .
hon members who read the cape argus during the course of the morning will have seen that people want to reduce this issue simply to a question of four votes .
if they are honest they will admit that they know that there is the potential for these problems to be solved , together , in areas such as the klein karoo and the southern cape .
i suggested to him that his party should make time available to him and afford him the opportunity to speak again , which is a normal rule of debate .
when they do not get the support of the majority , they fall back on the past and threaten mass action and boycotts - and that too has opened the eyes of the people .
i ask the hon member mr ramatlakane to stand with us when we enter discussions with them on thursday so that we can get that point across to cata and codeta .
they have spoken about resources and said that the people from the eastern cape come to what those hon members consider is this beautiful city and make a mess here .
ms pandor said that she was particularly astounded by the hon premier 's silence on the real issues facing the province , such as urban terror .
for the people taking part in the ceremony , it was an exceptional privilege to be able to share in such an occasion , but it was treated with utter disrespect .
did we not learn a harsh lesson during the apartheid years , with the disruption of our schools and the non-payment of service fees , for which we will continue paying the price for some time to come ?
one has to be part of their broad church , otherwise one is deemed a racist still clinging to the past and with no loyalty to south africa .
i just have to say that it was under his leadership that it became one of the main objectives of this government for us to ensure that we took a proper look at this matter .
only by getting oneself to the point of having one 's blood taken for testing does one come to full acceptance of the harsh realities of hiv / aids .
but what has also become increasingly clear is that the early and effective treatment of sexually transmitted diseases reduces transmission rates significantly - in some studies by up to 40 % .
we cannot realise sustained growth in this province unless we give attention to all the social backlogs and developmental problems confronting the majority of our people .
south africa had 61 murders per 100 000 of the population in 1996 , and 1 out of every 250 people in this country was the victim of sexual misconduct in 1997 .
all one has to do is look at the joblessness and fear that exists in the province and elsewhere - some delivery , some delivery !
we therefore do not have a problem with economic upliftment and so on , but we are bringing the debate back to the key elements confronting the western cape .
the hon premier saw fit to say nothing about the lot , the welfare or the social conditions of , or poverty relief for , the farm people of the western cape .
i heard the hon member mr gelderbloem say that there was a new np party , a party that had broken away from its past .
when she visited guguletu police station and did not get good service there , she wrote a letter complaining about bad service by guguletu police management .
as this parliament will know , the equitable share formula by its nature implies that the western cape 's allocation must continue to decline below the national average .
this budget therefore represents a move away from the conventional forms of budgeting towards performance budgeting , linked to service delivery , which focuses on objectives and measuring the attainment of those objectives .
( c ) an unwavering focus on cabinet 's deliverables , which i believe constitute a direct and binding contract with the citizens of this province , both individually and collectively .
a business plan still has to be submitted to cabinet to decide how best to take this forward , as this objective cuts across the activities of many departments .
this growth is important , as it allows some discretion , unlike the equitable share portion of the budget which moves in the opposite direction .
i must also thank cedric ismay and andr gildenhuys and the rest of the team who go out of their way to make me look as good as possible .
the committee supports the department in its attempt to rationalise the academic health institutions and would like to commend the management of tygerberg hospital for staying within its management plan .
i want to draw the attention of hon members to the fact that this report was not properly tabled , because we only had five days to complete the report .
it would seem increasingly that the anc elite is using power in the same way - look first after yourself and your buddies ; to hell with the poor , they can take care of themselves !
one way in which we can rectify this is to ensure that the standing committees dealing with all portfolios are not rubber stamps as they have been in the past .
as a whole , all the departments commented on the fact that the new system and the gfs is a much better tool when it comes to accountability and budgeting .
when people in the private sector search for office space they look for an office with a view on the mountain or the harbour .
to a great extent i understand why one wants a view of the mountain - after all , our forefathers told certain stories about where we came from .
mr speaker , may i first of all say that the second reading of this budget is not normal without the hon member ms essop present here today .
madam chairperson , another component in my department is that of the hon minister in the office of the premier responsible for the gender equality desk , the disability desk and the youth desk .
madam chairperson , it is said that leadership is action , not position , and that management is to lead by example , not to drive by fear .
after provision has been made for improved service benefits , the direct effect is r24 million less for this year , r266 million less for the 2000-01 financial year and r369 million less in the 2002-03 financial year .
when the results of the recent census are to be phased in between the 1999 and 2003 budgets , the eastern cape is to get 4 % less of the overall allocation - again according to idasa .
it is a fact that the western cape is providing services for people migrating from poorer areas and we should be given due consideration when the budget is divided .
i have already done a great deal of research , and it concerns my portfolio - that of poverty relief , for which , unfortunately , i was asked three weeks ago to accept responsibility .
although the business plans for the three desks were in place , r1 million of the project budget of my office was suspended and allocated to the manenberg disaster fund and not to voter registration .
in june 1999 one of the component 's directors attended an intensive two-week programme at the legislative drafting institute at the university of tulane in new orleans .
it provided intensive training on the critical issue of drafting legislation , as well as three days of invaluable exchange of experience and ideas among drafting personnel from throughout the country and overseas .
during this financial year will also be a greater focus on improving conditions of service projects ; improved consultation systems at hospitals ; and the computerisation of registration systems , to mention only a few examples .
a debate like this spans issues of intergovernmental relations , transformation , and the training and employment of key support staff , making it one of the most wide-ranging votes of this budget session .
i handed my business plan to the chairperson of the standing committee last year , together with the briefing i gave in parliament and at our bosberaad .
as i said before , a work study group is presently engaged in investigating the remuneration levels of legal staff members , as well as how best to retain newly trained members .
] i said that a number of new role-players in a new transformation unit had been tasked with overarching strategic responsibility to advise , monitor and guide reform .
the committee supports the department in its attempt to rationalise the academic health institutions and would like to commend the management of tygerberg hospital for staying within its management plan .
a recurring theme over the past few years has been the problematic situation of having this building shared by the provincial government / administration and the services provided for us here .
i want to express my appreciation and thanks to the deputy speaker , who is fulfilling her duties in an exemplary manner - " words are all i have to take your heart away .
madam chairperson , i can truly now say that i have the honour today to follow on someone on whom no one else in the house has ever yet followed .
madam chairperson , a parliamentary complex - that is , the least that a parliamentary set-up should entail - that does not have sufficient space is an excuse of a parliament .
as for the posts that the speaker has mentioned - these are posts in the provincial parliament that have to be filled - that issue has to be managed in terms of constitutional directives .
as it was a team effort , it would only be fair also to thank the speaker , and the secretary and all his staff for producing this budget .
now one needs to ask : why this limitation provision in the rules , limiting the powers of the committees and especially the powers of the chairpersons of the committees ?
] we will have to compete and ensure that our citizens also take notice of us and realise how important the legislation and the services that we render are for them .
i did not spend five minutes with him ; the hon member mr winde was also there and he can confirm that i spent nearly half an hour with him .
did the hon member mr ozinsky expect me to take mr west all the way back to george and go back to knysna for this meeting ?
it is clear to us that the hon premier is interfering with the workings of the iec and the registration of voters in the province .
hon members should rather jump to it and see whether they can furnish as many people as possible with identity documents , rather than sit back and complain about others coming forward .
( a ) our approach is to develop an economic strategy for the province and then to consider the institutional framework which will be most suitable to implement that strategy .
in fact , when we opened a new school recently - in fact , three years ago - all the educators were taken off the redeployment list .
( 3 ) informing police of the release of prisoners is a matter between the department of correctional services and the saps .
mr speaker , it would have been more ideal and correct to have tabled the report in a shorter period than nine months , but there were reasons for it .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon minister of finance and development planning whether it is actually possible to zone land that falls within the admiralty zone .
( 4 ) what provincial allocations are paid to the following cultural organisations , ( i ) the cape town philharmonic orchestra , ( ii ) artscape and ( iii ) the eoan group ;
the accounting officer of the western cape cultural commission appointed in terms of section 16 signs all cheques after the relevant supporting documentation has been submitted to her for consideration and approval .
moneys disbursed were used to purchase demonstration material for the presentation of the relevant projects , to pay honoraria to presenters and to hire venues .
in the light of the poor attendance at this specific meeting , one is inclined to ask oneself if crime and gang violence are really matters of concern to the communities .
mr speaker , it would be extremely difficult for me here , in the limited time we have , to explain all the problems relating to his .
mr speaker , i should very much like to ask the hon minister whether he indeed rectified the situation in the printed media and if not , for what reason .
the provincial government has not commissioned the compilation of an objective report on the province 's tourism facilities and services .
this arrangement has been exclusively concluded to give the applicants and the department of works , who are the landowners , the opportunity to solve the legal position concerning the houses .
this would unfortunately be very subjective and not an official answer of the department of local government , in which case i decline to answer .
( 2 ) whether any special safety and security arrangements were in place when miss south africa visited the school ; if not , why not ; if so , what are the relevant details ?
has the anc come out in favour of cooperative governance and said to the national minister of safety and security that he must start keeping his word ?
i believe that the western cape at least is a bastion of democracy and it is showing that centralism , as practised by the anc government , is not the way for africa to go .
there are a number of posts that are going to be upgraded and the superintendent-general level will be filled by the current white men in that level of the senior management echelon .
if i say as a description , " the ddg post currently managed by mr kallie saayman " , that does not say under any circumstances that he is the candidate .
the reason for that , sir , is a principle we have to establish as a government , collectively with the opposition , that one cannot negotiate about the enforcement of the law .
in reply to the previous question , the hon minister of education indicated firmly that one of the reasons for closing the 136 schools included savings and finances .
mr speaker , may i ask the hon minister of community safety , arising from the reply that he has just given , what the other police stations are , that is nos 1 , 2 and 3 ?
mr speaker , given that we will get the answer to nos 1 , 2 and 3 , could i have the answer to nos 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 and 10 ?
if there has been legal opinion regarding the unconstitutionality in some of the elements in the regulations , could we get that legal opinion from the hon minister of local government and development planning .
it is sad that the incidence of this disease is increasing , but it is important to understand that this is unrelated to the efficiency of our provincial tb programme .
there is absolutely no policy and certainly no permission for any learners in this province to be tested for hiv / aids unless they expressly would like to do so .
the issue is that it is not only the province that works with this , but also the office of the speaker on the instructions of the office of the premier .
should the hon member mr strachan wish to know he should ask me and it would be a pleasure to investigate the issue and provide him with the information .
the committee , in terms of regulation 3 ( 2 ) and 4 ( 5 ) made recommendations for appropriate resolve by the department , minister and cabinet .
mr speaker , the hon premier recently announced that the anc at beaufort west had plans to abduct him during his recent visit to the town .
the policy with regard to the building and construction industries came into operation with effect from 1 april 1999 , and the remainder with effect from 1 september 1999 .
this means that every administrative action taken by any sphere of government or organ of state has to be consistent with the constitution and governed by some or other form of legislation .
( 1 ) the national minister of public works has now concluded that the erven on the cape town foreshore vest in the name of the provincial government of the western cape .
( iii ) the cape town city council , the cape metropolitan council and the provincial government have made it quite clear that additional funding from the three aforementioned bodies will not be available .
mr speaker , the hon member mr r williams cannot direct that question to me ; he has to direct it to omega conferences as they printed the material .
the monitoring of the examination has also been intensified . area and circuit managers , safcert , the national department and head office all form individual monitoring teams which visit selected schools on examination days .
this amount will double in the next two years - a 3-year strategy with 20 % of schools targeted for year 1 , a further 40 % for year 2 and the remaining 40 % for year 3 .
] i can refer the question that he asked me back to him so that he can then ask mr irwin , who has also received pmr awards , what he does .
mr speaker , much of what the hon premier said in his opening address today gave us an indication of what our budget will look like in future .
firstly , i would like to wish the hon premier a happy 60th birthday and hope that he has many more , even if some of those are from the opposition benches .
the hon minister - and i would like to thank him for coming to scof - said that the proposals on the environmental commissioner have been tabled before cabinet .
i am really concerned to see that another r180 000 has been rolled over , especially considering that the manufacturing advisory centre has not come to fruition yet .
the budget adjustments tabled today are in addition to those tabled on 17 october 2000 referred to later as the first revised budget .
permit me , mr speaker , to deal with these variations from the first revised budget which total some r263,2 million under the applicable headings to the adjustments estimate .
then , of course , yesterday the hon leader of the opposition and the hon member mr dugmore appealed that we restructure the coalition with the anc as a partner .
i believe that the debate could have been very constructive if it had not been for the attack by the anc on persons - not only on me , but on other individuals .
from the side of the anc we are saying that there should be legal opinion which may seek redress , an interdict in the high court or a review of the ruling in the ...
i take note of what the hon minister of local government has said , but these spillages can occur again and it is the people of the macassar area that are suffering .
what is more disturbing is the fact that when he is there , they are bombarded with political questions and , not only that , these meetings have been called on official police letterheads .
mr speaker , when the constitution - i am referring to the national and provincial ones - calls for the province to intervene , of course we will .
one must bear in mind that we are currently 3 500 members under strength and any supplementation , apart from the very half-hearted supplement from national level , is done by community police officers .
mr speaker , i hope you will allow me to use the opportunity to also from this side of the house express our congratulations to the hon member mr silke on his marriage .
we hope that his marriage will not have the same effect as it had on an hon member on this side of the house with regard to participation .
the regional council is currently in the process of consolidating the network of access routes and has also undertaken to do an evaluation in order to decide on access to potentially sensitive areas .
if , after investigations , we find that the environment is being degraded or being negatively impacted on , we will take action in terms of sections 28 and 31 of the national environmental management act ( nema ) .
mr speaker , i want to ask the hon premier how many lunches , teas , meetings or any other discussions he had with judge president king in the run-up to the abie williams case .
this , together with relief given to all provinces by the national minister of finance in the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 financial years , has drastically improved the debt overhang position of the province .
the phasing-in window period of about 10 years remains too long , and we hope that it will not be abused by corrupt officials in other provinces to further their own interests .
the andrew levy report for 1999-2000 released just recently confirmed that 1 million jobs , and not 500 000 as previously estimated , had been lost in the formal sector .
ironically , the role of civilian oversight is currently being downgraded at national level with the secretariat being moved into the minister 's office and falling under the deputy minister .
to research the levels of service by specific police stations through , amongst other methods , analysing the 10111 numbers , as well as our 24-hour complaints number located in the department .
after the adoption of a code of conduct and constitution , a formal signing ceremony was held between the affected parties , namely the neighbourhood watch projects , community police forums , the police and the department of community safety .
secondly , from june training will be transferred from paarl - where we are currently doing the training modules - to oudtshoorn training grounds where facilities are better suited for basic training .
in the short term an operational centre is established ; in the medium term there is the street child programme ; and in the long term the priority is project metamorphosis , with the manenberg and mitchells plain projects as pilot programmes .
madam chairperson , i wish to express my thanks to the municipalities in the province for the variety of support programmes they have undertaken , from traffic constables to beach constables who have assisted .
i also wish to convey my sincere thanks to the director-general and the members of the madam for the major contribution they are making to bring about effective coordination throughout the province .
the new np wants the assurance that all law-abiding citizens of the western cape should at all times be assured that the saps have their interests and safety at heart .
i also wish to express my thanks for the outstanding detective work done in dysselsdorp resulting in the arrest of the alleged murderers of three teenagers who died so tragically .
in the beginning of the hon minister 's speech today he gave what i must say is a very bleak picture of the reality in this province at the moment .
madam chairperson , we on this side of the house would like to thank mr joshua and his team for their cooperation and for the help that they have given us .
it has a major backlog and i am afraid i have to say that there is also a great lack of coordination between the department of justice and the police .
this included the funding of 60 sports codes that have been assisted with programmes to ensure that more people in the western cape can play sport , especially those from disadvantaged communities .
i have no intention whatsoever of disbanding the national sport council until such time as a workable option is there , as i am not prepared to lose contact with the sport codes .
it is also empirically proven that children who do physical education at school also have a higher attention capacity when it comes to assimilating school work and they are also more obedient .
the situation overall , therefore , is not healthy and i wish to announce that i have set up a school sport policy committee to deliver such policy to the province during 2000 .
i should be neglecting my duty if i were not to congratulate the hon minister and his department on the way in which they are also using sport as a mechanism to prevent crime .
firstly , to ensure greater participation in sport and recreation programmes ; secondly , to improve accessibility to sporting facilities in the western cape ; and , thirdly , to increase participation in school sport .
european expertise in a variety of fields , including technology , tourism , education and cultural exchange , as well as new initiatives in energy provision , will now be coming to the western cape during the next few months .
in the field of environmental management a visit is planned by a delegation of experts from the western cape to upper austria , where they will evaluate the level of support to be provided .
it also demands of all of us who have influence in the various constituencies of our province to preach peace and reconciliation and to walk the talk .
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 7 - corporate services of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1998 [ pr 124 / 1999 ] .
however , i wish to remind you of what happened earlier this week in the house , when the hon member mr louis moved his motion and motivated it entirely , without any interruption .
when i present this framework in various forums , representatives from these schools tell me this is all very obvious ; one cannot possibly run a decent school without them .
mr chairperson , it is this drive which we believe is characteristic of the vast majority of people that we in the wced seek to encourage and support across our education system .
mr chairperson , as far as the languages are concerned , we established benchmarks for the foundation phase and used the policy reserve fund to do significant research into the needs of multilingual classrooms .
i am determined to ensure that this training has direct relevance for the core curriculum at each level , giving emphasis to our curriculum priorities and that all educators attend these courses .
we aim to move from a punitive model to one that combines discipline with development , offering these children a second chance to sort out their lives .
i wish to extend a special word of thanks to the spokesmen of the anc and the udm , the hon members messrs gabru and lewis , for the contributions they have made .
i want to thank the western cape education department for the new model they have developed to assist these young people and to get rid of the old youth care system in the process .
mr chairperson , we in this province and in this country are facing many challenges and education is one of the most important , complex and difficult challenges of all .
this will enable our people to fulfil their potential to play a part in building a successful 21st century economy with growing prosperity for all .
for my part , from our political party , i would like to take the opportunity to thank the hon minister of education for her very dedicated and committed contribution towards the schooling profession .
madam chairperson , the national norms and standards for the funding of schools have created expectations in many schools , and more than one of the previous speakers have mentioned this today .
in this province we have inherited a very strong independent school sector , ranging from well-established , well-resourced schools to those who serve the poor and the disadvantaged .
i do hope that we have the guts , and certainly if this review committee comes up with major recommendations for change , i will not make any party-political points out of it .
does the hon member expect me to get the agreement of all the people involved before we go in and get the documents to establish whether there is wide-scale fraud happening ?
i am delighted to hear the hon member saying that that community is now mobilising to become involved in improving the school .
we have come to an agreement with the red cross society of south africa that throughout the province the air ambulance will now be available to offer helicopter transport for patients within 200 km of cape town .
i would therefore like to ask the hon minister to look into these issues , and at some appropriate time in the future to report back to the standing committee .
i am sure everyone is aware of the flu that affected thousands of people in the usa and europe , killing a 33-year-old welsh soccer player .
although we are constantly praised for high standards and competency in the western cape , we should note the warning of william shakespeare : " never let power to flattery bow !
in the same session in september , 1999 he moved a motion to the effect that he took responsibility for the introduction in the house of legislation regarding medical waste .
a group of experts , including those from the kings fund , told us that for us to manage we should not let our health personnel figures go below 27 500 .
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 6 - health of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1998 [ pr 2 / 2000 ] .
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 6 - community safety of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1999 [ pr 23 / 2000 ] .
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 9 - agriculture of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1999 [ pr 17 / 2000 ] .
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 1 - premier of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1998 [ pr 122 / 1999 ] .
for the 1998-1999 financial year the mentioned amount , r11,586 million , was allocated to the province for individual projects , but for the 1999-2000 financial year an amount of only r5 000 was allocated to the western cape province .
- establishing policy objectives and measurable targets to enhance and broaden women 's economic opportunities and their access to productive resources , particularly women who have no source of income .
- by considering the action , the development programmes for addressing the suspension of the maintenance allowances , as my colleague indicated , will also , of course , have to be given attention .
the department of social services is currently a role-player in this field , together with the health and education departments and ngos , and a networking system is currently being debated .
the department told us , and the hon minister told us here today as well , that after two years only a little more than 6 000 children receive child support grants .
mr chairperson , i might be wrong in the date , but the flagship projects the hon acting minister of social services referred to here were started in the 1995-96 financial year ; they were pilot projects .
if the department does not bring legislation to address this matter , i intend bringing a private member 's motion as soon as the house sits again .
i was pleased to hear the hon minister 's report on the successes of the department , and it is good to hear that they are making a difference .
madam chairperson , i very gladly take part in this debate , considering that you have said that you may be a veteran in the area of welfare .
then we would not have a long queue of people who have historically been advantaged occupying the front end of the waiting queue to enter those old-age homes .
business plans were drawn up for the following mtef period , based on the indication from the national department of housing that r351 million would be allocated to this province for the following three financial years .
the uncertainty regarding our budget could easily have made one throw in the towel , but this province has always been able to count on role-players who do not easily allow themselves to be defeated .
last but not least , the chairman of the provincial housing development board , mr billy coetzee , received the chairman 's award from the institute for housing for his continued dedication to the housing process .
the department is currently working on establishing a provincial housing programme through which local authorities can be financially assisted to acquire suitable land so as to address crisis situations such as that of wallacedene .
i am pleased to advise that during the past year a housing policy development course , presented by the university of stellenbosch and funded by the national department of housing , was held .
innovative ways will have to be found to generate income for housing and to ensure sound financial principles in the western cape , for which the skills of a competent business manager are required .
local governments who are unable to recover money in respect of service or rate charges are now being forced to sell off these subsidy houses in order to recover the outstanding debt .
i am pleased to announce that the national department of housing is investigating the introduction of a formal tendering process that will incorporate the procurement principles of transparency , equity and sound administrative practices .
] later in my speech i will refer to what can , at best , be described as a dereliction of duty and , at worst , as criminal neglect by the political leadership of this province .
if the hon minister is rushing to sell off this land which could be used for housing , why is it that none of the casino money was allocated to housing ?
mr chairperson , in this province our housing backlog is estimated at between 220 000 and 230 000 units in the metropole area , and a further 40 000 units in rural areas .
since 1994 the department has delivered 130 000 homes in this province , but it seems that we are failing to keep pace with the rate of growth in demand for houses .
chapter 10 of the constitution of the western cape , 1998 ( act 1 of 1998 ) , provides under the heading , " directive principles of provincial policy " , in section 81 , and i quote :
today some of them are bricklayers , some carpenters , some plumbers , some plasterers - life skills that they never had before , but have today , and with which they can support their families .
the most important reason for this - i think people will suggest several reasons - is the confusion that exists with the double voters ' roll that we have at this stage .
the various political parties are represented there by , at the moment , five members of the new np , five members of the anc and one member of the dp .
it seems to me that it could be called , " the last stand of the new np , " since the latest figures indicate that the new np has dropped by 50 % .
we have already passed the first important milestones , and the hon minister referred to them : the demarcation and proclamation of what is called the unicity and what are called the category b municipalities .
however , it is a cynical oversimplification to blame the councils exclusively for those problems , as has been the tendency , especially when it is an anc-controlled council that is experiencing problems .
there is , however , some concern that the support programmes that have already been identified and for which the funding has already been approved , relate mainly to municipalities in categories 1 to 6 .
the preparation for local government elections is going through a very important stage and messrs john africa , faan naude and michael brewis need our support for the whole of the coming year .
the decision was taken in the cape metropolitan area , and also outside it , that the way of the 1993 ordinance would be followed , but we will keep the options open .
these independently facilitated workshops are designed to sensitise personnel to the demands and expectations of the workplace in the new post-apartheid environment of equity , accountability and transparency .
in order to implement this act , two requirements had to be met : firstly , the promulgation of the regulations , and , secondly , the appointment of the planning review board .
the policy has , since then , been amended accordingly and will be submitted to the provincial cabinet shortly for approval to have the draft policy advertised as a green paper for public comment .
arising out of this , amendments may be necessary both to draft legislation , such as the municipal systems bill and the green paper on planning , and to the western cape planning and development act of 1999 .
i must point out that the subdirectorate 's ability to execute and manage its information function is still hampered by the shortage of skilled human resources and limited funding .
it states that every municipality shall , and i quote : ( g ) annually report to and receive comments from its community regarding the objectives set in its integrated development plan .
] the original decision to overturn what local government had decided was a very bad decision , because local government knows what is happening on the ground .
this means that the hon minister 's claim last year that this board would be in place by april , or that the regulations would be in place by april , has not been met .
mr chairperson , i would further like to add my full support to the new coastal zone policy of the hon minister which also falls in line with conservation and is very important to me .
finally - the hon minister has spelt this out here repeatedly - what the province is aiming for is to bring about an intervention into the constitutional powers of local authorities .
we will still see whether those are minor legal technicalities in a new situation or whether they were actually issues to do with the process that was followed .
does he want me to go to the constitutional court on certain items and delay the introduction of the act even further by working through the land use planning ordinance ?
] i want to point out to the hon minister of finance and development planning that of the four people who voted in the south peninsula municipality committee , three were new np members .
we are all familiar with the phrases of a culture of learning and teaching ; a culture of non-violence ; a culture of tolerance ; a culture of non-racialism ; and a culture of human rights .
this responsibility for the welfare of the environment or for the care of the earth will emerge more strongly when the government also addresses issues such as ownership rights and access rights .
i want to place on record that i am very supportive of culture , the need to promote cultural activity and all the issues the hon member ms vantura has raised in her speech .
this will be the first time this year that the cultural commission will be looking at the funding that they hand out , and i have the utmost faith in them that they are going to be doing a good job .
] i would like to say that i will personally ensure that hon members get a copy of the criteria that apply there and also a copy of our application form .
] they do not even know that the land they bought was taken from other people or that it was bought from people for two cows and a bull .
the department of transport continues to provide the facility of capacitation of emerging consultants and contractors , as well as job creation for targeted groups , such as women , the youth and the unemployed , through its road construction projects .
it is therefore of the utmost importance that the client departments appreciate that it is the primary responsibility of works to ensure that the asset portfolio of the province is maintained .
i agree with and support mr carel du preez when he says that we need to be visionaries in this department and look at the element of transport holistically .
madam chairperson , this morning i encountered no fewer than four vehicles that were too big and too wide , carrying tractors and so on , being escorted by vehicles .
madam chairperson , i say " they decided in their wisdom " because it is this piece of road which is costing the most to maintain at the moment .
i want to convey my sincere thanks today to one and all who have joined me in this struggle , for the fact that they helped me with this road .
madam chairperson , i noticed with interest that in his budget speech at the beginning of the debate the hon minister spoke isixhosa .
they know what it is like when poverty is mentioned in the context of the poor blacks - in the inclusive sense of coloured , indian and african - in this province .
we know the community-based public works programmes , the nef , the rural community employment programme , and the transport pilot project aimed at creating jobs and developing skills in the community .
i say that the myth that women cannot do the same work that men can do has been dispelled during the process of implementing public works programmes internationally .
madam chairperson , i am happy to say that mincom has produced results in the restructuring and reorganisation of the minibus taxi industry , as the hon minister indicated earlier on .
we have been given the assurance in the standing committee that the contract system in the integration of the public transport system is not going to exclude the small and medium enterprises , the small operators .
if that hon member looks it up , he will see that it is the biggest piece of legislation relating to transport yet , not only in this province but in the entire country .
mr chairperson , if funds cannot be found now to maintain existing roads at approximately the same standard , where will money be found to build new roads ?
i am sure that using this legislation to upgrade chapmans peak drive and perhaps establishing a ring road around cape town will go a long way towards alleviating traffic congestion .
in addition to the sticker , there should be a telephone number on the back of the vehicle so that ordinary citizens can call and report vehicles that are not adhering to the speed limit .
i found it strange that gauteng , our biggest province , have increased their motor licence fees by 10 % ; kwazulu-natal by 8 % and the northern cape have not increased their licensing fees at all .
i make an earnest appeal to the hon minister of transport and works to take a fresh look at persons who throw cigarette butts out of their windows while driving .
we want to hear about it in the works programme , because there , i believe , is where most of the contracts to small and medium enterprises can go and most empowerment can take place .
if it is true that we have put a different emphasis on words from time to time , then that is the fault of people and not of officials of this department .
whether the department is known as " works " or as " public works " , when we do the work , then we do it , whatever the name may be .
i could have taken the whole floor for myself and thrown out the hon minister of agriculture , and he could have taken the bottom floor . however , what would that have meant ?
there are already two tender contracts , but we shall separate them in such a way that there is no interruption in the construction of the road as is the case at present .
the hon member mr king also referred to the licence disc which , in terms of the road transport regulations , must be placed in the bottom left-hand corner of the windshield of a vehicle .
] it is very important that a municipality like porterville - and i wish to mention it here - goes out of its way to look after its rural neighbours as well .
the products of many of the people who cultivate export products there arrive at the market in a very poor condition and are then no longer suitable for the export market .
( 3 ) expresses itself in favour of a moratorium on these kinds of transactions , and in cases where transactions are carried out , would like to see a right of sale established in favour of the municipality .
when any hon member moves a motion without notice , there is a risk that objection can be recorded immediately for incorrect reasons and that the motion can go no further .
the entry into the 21st century is often associated with the entry into a new phase of global economic development , labelled the " knowledge economy " or the " knowledge society " .
the synergies between these two developments are very powerful , causing substantial challenges not only for the companies directly involved , but also for the regions and countries .
as such their technology contributes to solving a growing environmental challenge for urban environments all over the world , namely smog caused in part by exhaust emissions from cars .
as far as the institutional architecture is concerned , or the agencies through which the province will and must work in order to implement economic policy , our approach is to create a partnership of economic development institutions .
moreover , one of the best forms of empowerment of businesses in our disadvantaged communities is to link enterprises from those communities to partnerships with foreign investors who wish to invest here .
the persons with the best knowledge of those matters are those persons who work with the foreign investors , and that , too , is what is already happening on a de facto basis within wesgro .
the board of the convention centre company is currently busy with three separate processes to identify a design team , an operator and a strategic partner to develop a hotel on the site .
may i also congratulate the whole department of economic affairs , agriculture and tourism , from mr carel du preez to everyone else sitting there , on the superb work they have done .
i want to concede today , however , that in ireland i learnt that what was good to see was all the different role-players singing the same hymn from the same song sheet .
hon members must remember that , three years ago , when i was the minister responsible for this portfolio , i started to apply for section 28 ( 1 ) certificates .
if the hon minister cannot answer me , i shall probably have to have the question placed on the question paper in order to find out how far we are with this matter .
one should also give credit for the people in the department , and i am going to mention a few , namely dr loreen platzky and also , particularly as far as tourism is concerned , ms carol nhlumayo .
these can be either public sector funded , like the proposed r300 million convention centre envisaged for the cape metro area , or private sector led , like the century city theme park .
the hon minister has to take responsibility and actually drive the issue very fast , because the hon member mr strachan has raised all the social problems and social consequences of that matter .
the creation of job opportunities such as those generated by the rural projects are one way of empowering our people with new skills and ensuring a quality of life to our people .
i want to thank the officials of this province , dr barnard , mr du preez , drs van rooyen and visser and messrs blomerus , venter and niemand , as well as the staff on all levels .
one again , therefore , this is an entrenchment , and no real attention will be given to women , the children , the rural areas and so on as far as the commercial areas are concerned .
i also want to thank them for all the support i have received , and in particular from the hon member mr louis , who is the chairperson of the standing committee .
( 3 ) that this feeling of joy and victory manifested itself in the march by 2 000 residents on saturday , 15 april 2000 , and wishes to congratulate the said communities on this .
european expertise in a variety of fields , including technology , tourism , education and cultural exchange , as well as new initiatives in energy provision , will now be coming to the western cape during the next few months .
in the field of environmental management a visit is planned by a delegation of experts from the western cape to upper austria , where they will evaluate the level of support to be provided .
it also demands of all of us who have influence in the various constituencies of our province to preach peace and reconciliation and to walk the talk .
i am heartened that across the political spectrum there is unanimity and support for the proposed legislation that is now on the table .
mr speaker , permit me the opportunity to refer to the hon member mr ramatlakane and the other hon members of the anc who are members of the standing committee .
the bill prescribes very clearly what procedures will be followed in announcing an area that will be subject to emergency measures , and i shall comply with this procedure in detail .
mr speaker , this legislation was brought to the standing committee to give the hon minister of transport and works the necessary powers to act in certain extraordinary circumstances .
on the local road transportation board we call for transformation without delay , in contrast with the hon minister 's programme , according to which he will look into this matter again in july 2000 .
the anc is ready to call all parties back to the table to negotiate and accept the document as a sustainable manner of addressing public transport problems .
if the hon leader of the opposition was on the n2 this morning , he will have seen how the people come in their hundreds to catch the buses that are standing there .
mr speaker , i would like to draw hon members ' attention to the fact that the proposed clause 30a does not require prior notice of the declaration of a declared area .
the reason for this - and i am coming to the speech by the hon member mr ramatlakane - is that the circumstances may be such as to require very swift action .
" they were among the best at uitsig - hardworking and always dedicated to the task and their studies .
mr speaker , on a point of order : is it in order for an hon member of the house to attack a constitution which he has sworn an oath to abide by ?
each of us who attempts to examine this in a superficial way will come very badly short because this is a problem that has been encountered in our province for many decades .
recently the sunday times reported on a case where the people had to forfeit their incomes for the sake of a belief in justice in order to go and hide in another province .
mr speaker , one always thinks that violence and abuse are something that happens out there to other people , until it happens to somebody close to one , someone that one knows .
human rights programmes must be included in school curricula to empower our children regarding their rights , and to teach them to respect the rights of those around them .
mr speaker , i am not going to stoop to the level of that side of the house to say how many bodies i saw and how many families i visited .
mr speaker , the natural attrition rate of the police in the saps at the moment is between 6 000 and 8 000 per annum , but we are only going to recruit 2 500 .
one must thus deduct 20 % of the 127 000 and 10 % to 12 % of senior office personnel who will never get into the field because they are doing management tasks .
let us take the larger number and divide 60 000 members of the police into a total population of at least 45 million , and one will find that south africa is one of the most thinly policed countries in the world .
only after we had pointed the situation out to them and a couple of bombs had gone off in lenasia , did they suddenly realise that this was not a western cape situation .
l brown , j p gelderblom ( chairperson ) , n m isaacs , a ismail , h a lewis , m louis , l ramatlakane , d silke , a e van zyl , a j williams , r williams ,
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 12 - education of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1999 [ pr 66 / 2000 ] .
but by the time we received this legal opinion it was too late for the hon minister to grant his approval in terms of section 7 of the treasury act .
mr speaker , if we remember the old days of apartheid , that call to national service was keenly responded to by many public servants when they were conscripted into the military .
if a legitimate electoral process and the fostering of democracy are within that bill of rights , which they are , i would submit that we are indeed fulfilling our constitutional obligation .
secondly , i wish to quote from section 41 ( 1 ) of chapter 3 , co-operative government - with the subtitle , principles of co-operative government and intergovernmental relations - as follows :
in all the supporting evidence and documentation that came before the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling yesterday it was made absolutely clear where the request came from .
] is it because of a lack of transformation and the centralised command style of dr barnard and they are living in fear and a similar disillusionment to what i have spoken about ?
mr speaker , to begin with i want to thank the hon minister of finance and development planning for his support of the independent electoral commission for the authorisation of funds spent for the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 financial years .
mr speaker , the new np thanks the director-general for his farsightedness and for the reaction by him and his staff to the request by the central government to further the process of registration .
mr speaker , unfortunately i have only a mini oxford dictionary , but i checked the word and it has the same definition there as that in the larger oxford dictionary .
mr speaker , i am sure the house will agree that the voter registration process was indeed an exceptional event that demanded extraordinary action by the provincial government in the public interest .
in terms of the rules and according to my understanding of the committee stage , members should be allowed to ask ministers three questions and ministers then respond to those questions .
the provincial government made a decision to allocate the money to assist the iec in voter registration , but each provincial minister must account for that money .
madam chairperson , my question yet again is : i would like to know on which actual days expenditures in terms of the r65 181,71 listed in vote 1 were made ?
given the fact that at the retreat community health centre last week people were turned away without even panado , could that r3 000 not be used ?
madam chairperson , the hon minister has said that he cannot answer the question regarding his vote and that i should ask the hon minister of finance and development planning .
madam chairperson , if you are going to say that any question can be put to any minister under any vote , then we are breaking the rules of the house .
madam chairperson , no , there is no way in which i can anticipate what the debate was in the cabinet at that stage and i do not wish to express an opinion in that regard .
madam chairperson , could the hon minister of finance and development planning explain to the house how , prior to the end of a financial year , he was able to save r158 000 ?
madam chairperson , on a point of order : the hon minister of finance and development planning had the opportunity to feel very offended about being accused of being in contempt of the house .
madam chairperson , i left the classification of this contribution to the discretion of the head of my department , in whom i have the fullest confidence , and his director : finance .
that is why i have said in my reply in terms of schedule 1 that there was no major loss to health and that health services were not affected because of voter registration .
i do hope it is not the hon minister responsible for sport who should answer the question , because then i am asking the wrong minister .
madam chairperson , because this is a finance bill , central to my mind in the way in which i voted today was whether education had lost any money .
mr speaker , before we continue with that , on a point of clarity : many questions have been asked here today , and many replies have been that the hon ministers will come back with the answers .
no , the hon member ms essop indeed rose too early , she then waited for the hon minister of finance and development planning to ask that the third reading be put now .
yet they continue along the established trends of development of the western and northern segments of the metropole without a similar level of investment in the south-eastern part of the metropole .
i hope and pray that the hon premier 's wishes are fulfilled so that all the things he talked about can be attained , in order that people can reap the fruits thereof .
the initiative to second the national deputy commissioner of police , andr pruis , to this province on a full-time basis to attend to the taxi problem in cooperation with others , was a national initiative .
why is it that the top 20 students for the second year running in the western cape all come from former model c schools and are all from the white community ?
] no , it absolutely does not because their voters are moving away from them and they have not woken up to that little fact yet .
i will tell hon members what is going on there because their representatives obviously do not know it and they do not care to tell them .
having tried in vain to engage the local councillor in addressing their concerns , they have turned to the da to assist them .
i refused to accept that anyone could dictate to me where i could go and whom i could visit , and so i kept on going to crossroads .
here i must mention my disappointment at the lengths to which some educators and the anc are prepared to go in order to get teachers out of classrooms for political purposes .
it would be better for the da to tone down its oozing confidence , because the anc will continue to mobilise the people of the western cape behind the programme of transformation .
the party that has not had any part in uniting the people of the western cape is today lecturing us on how not to divide the people !
if our social well-being , our health , our economy , our tourism industry , our image as a player in the global economy is to be lifted , we must start with having a clean environment .
whatever the reasons may be the perception is that the heath commission needs to be removed from the scene because it has become such a thorn in the side of the mbeki administration .
the hon premier , for example , referred to small and medium enterprises and said that this would be the second key strategy for the promotion of economic growth and jobs in this province .
mr speaker , it is just that kind of blatant denial of the human rights of farm workers that has convinced me once again that this government only protects the privileges of the minority .
as a result of the prohibition on publishing crime statistics i cannot even provide up-to-date statistics today about the number of farmers and their wives who have been murdered on farms .
last year the national minister of finance granted a rebate to the fishing industry ; we believe that this year he has no option but to give that to the agricultural industry as well .
recently i have been informed that the charge against mr jonker was withdrawn and that the director of public prosecutions could find no grounds to proceed with the case .
sir , let me say to the hon member mr jacobs that i am becoming tired of participating in the hiv / aids debate , which has cost this country dearly .
madam chairperson , i would like to ask the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism a question in regard to the money that was spent on poverty relief in the southern cape .
if i had been given earlier notice , i could have done so , but i have unfortunately not looked that particular matter up , so i cannot tell the hon member .
talking about this , mr speaker , let me say that obviously it is about democracy being affected because passengers cannot exercise their right to choose their transport .
what we in the anc are saying is that we are concerned , and we will remain concerned , at the fact that those people remain in the middle of this dispute .
we in the dp call on the hon minister of transport and works to use the powers he has to restore the rule of law in those areas .
the hon minister of transport and works has really been confronted with a very sensitive matter because , believe me , if he does not close the taxi ranks , he will be criticised .
at the end of the day it ought not to be an issue of who gets credit for the solution of problems , but one of maximum service delivery to the people of the western cape .
i am not sure if the hon ministers who have participated in the debate are trying to be patronising , or simply to paint a gloomy picture of khayelitsha .
the hon member mr ramatlakane put it clearly when he said that a programme was already in place ; it simply needed somebody to implement it .
similarly , it is an incontrovertible fact that the anc is in government nationally and is the only institution that has the control over the police , the courts and the army .
the taxi industry have the free run of the township ; not for five days of the week or for weekends , but for seven days of the week - the buses are out .
for example , we read in the press , " i will hold the taxis " , " closure looms for the taxis " , " danny abrahams says the legislation is published tomorrow .
sir , the hon leader of the opposition said that i had said in the house since september that the formalisation process would be finalised by the end of the year .
four of the five companies that submitted a bid for the metropolitan licence did indeed give priority and included some form of convention centre in their bid .
the reason why cape town cannot yet present it is the fact that we do not have sufficient broad-band capacity in our telecommunications infrastructure to actually make it happen .
we do not have an act that gives us the necessary authorisation and for that reason we needed an act on the statute book that would authorise the participation of the provincial government in convenco .
sir , if cape town is 27th on the list of important cities in the world for the holding of conventions , then this is something that all of us should be excited about .
at this stage i think it is necessary that we reiterate what we said in the standing committee , that we unreservedly support the establishment of a convention centre for cape town .
we identified the shortcomings in the shareholders ' agreement , as well as in the bill , and our views coincided with the views of the auditor-general , as the hon member ms essop will point out .
for the interest of hon members who did not read the agreements , i would like to point out that from one agreement to the other there is a change in shareholder arrangements .
his contribution to the convention centre is indispensable , because if one does not have operators and people who organise conferences , one does not know how to configure a conference centre .
on land use and zoning planning , obviously , as in any big project of this type , it must be approved by the appropriate public authority , which at this point is the city of cape town .
however , one third of any proceeds of all the foreshore land - and this goes back to the foreshore act of the 1950s - must go to the city of cape town .
that side of the house should accept the hon minister 's concession and let us get on with the bill , because it would otherwise be unfair .
mr speaker , in all earnest i appeal to hon members of the house to refrain , here and in public , from criticising the judiciary .
however , we also know for a fact that the majority of the people of this country have a profound distrust of the apartheid era judiciary , and not without reason .
it is not as if i would be thwarting the legal system thereby , but i do believe that this would definitely have an influence on the kind of finding that i would deliver .
the hon minister of health gave the example of the zimbabwean situation , where the court delivered a judgment regarding land issues and it was summarily ignored by the government .
we have heard some of the comments that have been made in the house this morning , and i would like to refer to some things that were said with regard to the boesak case .
however , we have the police commissioner , who is a senior civil servant , saying that the human rights commission simply does not know what it is talking about and does not have a handle on reality .
we have not interfered ; we have simply asserted the right that while we are trying to transform the judiciary there should be the right to criticise judgments .
we said that we were joining the np in order to have a vehicle for the upliftment of our people , and not to go along with a policy .
mr speaker , mrs kosana is one example of millions of black people in this country who have been denied the opportunity of owning a house through access to home loans in our banking institutions .
for all the black people - coloured and african people - living in this country , this is the kind of reply one will receive when one applies for a home loan .
mr speaker , access to finance was raised in the ncop small and medium enterprise conference as a key problem facing small and medium enterprises in this country today .
a certain mr latzky , who has a 32-year record of service with standard bank , applied for a r1,2 million loan to expand his really flourishing panel-beating business .
" their message is , " our leaders , especially tony leon , will come and meet you personally , and welcome you to the dp once you have become a member of this desk .
it is time for the new np to denounce the unacceptable behaviour of the dp and the abuse of his privileges by the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism .
the furthest that they were able to go was doing what the hon leader of the opposition mentioned , which was to take this to the human rights commission .
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 7 - corporate services of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1998 [ pr 124 / 1999 ] ;
that the house notes the demand by the community of saron that the leader of the opposition should resign , and that the anc continues to lose support in that region .
another indication of the excess violence attached to these attacks is the fact that in 1997 40 % of the victims were elderly people of 60 years and older .
agriculture forms a very important part of the economy of south africa and the agriculture of the western cape is one of the main pillars on which our sound and prosperous economy is built .
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 1 - premier of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1999 [ pr 85 / 2000 ] .
( 5 ) requests the saps and the minister to accurately monitor this tendency in order to intervene timeously to prevent further outward rippling ; and
it is clear that the reference to the " peanut gallery " could be an insult to the people on the gallery , or to other hon members of the house .
the hon member mr ismail has already referred to the fact that there have been substantial arrests and , i am pleased to say , convictions in this regard over a period of time .
one would think that before we embarked on spending r0,5 million on such a commission , we would at least have some evidence to put before it .
mr speaker , the executive members ' ethics act is very clear about its definition of " any other person " and that would include family members .
it is time that the gossip about this matter that has been blown about by the anc and what i believe are entirely unsubstantiated allegations are revealed for what they really are .
the hon minister reads , for his own convenience , only certain things out of the document of the national minister of education , and leaves out par 3.5 , which provides , and i quote :
mr speaker , as i have said - read my lips - i have never considered having any interest whatsoever in any matter relating to the convention centre or any hotel matter at all .
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 5 - finance of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1999 [ pr 103 / 2000 ] .
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 7 - health of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1999 [ pr 105 / 2000 ] .
mr speaker , i want to request the hon minister of community safety to draw it very pertinently to the attention of the national minister of safety and security and the nia .
i wish the injured everything of the best and i call upon the leaders of his party to convey my best wishes to the hon premier .
every person has every right to have an objection , but in a democracy such as ours one conducts one 's cause by arguing standpoints .
mr speaker , i do not know whether after the two sound contributions by the hon members messrs byneveldt and a j williams one should take the debate any further .
one reads and listens in disbelief to the various theories of experts or quasi-experts as to what should have been done or what ought to be done to rectify the situation .
the motion seeks to defuse a response from the hon minister of community safety as to how he can make a contribution within the framework of his monitoring power to contain the terror .
the udm believes that if the theory of the national government as to who is responsible for the terror is correct , then it is indeed irresponsible to confront the suspects in public .
i would go further and say that this country has been appreciative of its muslim community in ways which observers from other muslim countries find astonishing , given the small size of the muslim community .
that is why , and i am honestly prepared to go on record on this , i believe that in the taxi violence case a lot of the negotiations there were fundamentally unsound .
this requires police action to pre-empt acts of terror and to convict those responsible , together with political action to win the support of the public against the violent minority .
just next door , at melkbosstrand and bloubergstrand - the best part of the coast in any event - they gained free access to the sea , and now i am speaking about whites .
some months ago in this house i drew the attention of hon members to the grave allegations about the way in which the hospital 's affairs were being conducted , and so on .
al oortuig jy nie die boere nie , jy weet ten minste dat dit ' n klomp ure is wat die da moet gebruik om die mense te oortuig om te gaan stem .
the hon minister of education must read the hansard report of her speeches , because it is clear that the leaders in this house should be cautious in the things they say .
while we agree that racism should be exposed , and that a single incident of racism is one too many , the anc picks out every incident to which they can possibly attach a racial twist .
] i do not think there are many parties in the history of world politics that have squandered such an international reservoir of goodwill and respect as quickly as the anc has .
it is only the eradication of poverty and creation of new jobs and opportunities that will stop a racialised fight to the death over shrinking resources in a declining economy .
in this context affirmative action benefits the new lite as a cheap , but ultimately socially ruinous substitute for creating more jobs and opportunities for all in a growing economy .
while nelson mandela was president of this country it was hon members of that opposition over there who called for an end to what they called his symbolic leadership .
the hon member may therefore change his motion to read " will possibly be withdrawn " in ( 1 ) or else he will have to wait until it has been withdrawn .
this approach by the anc , of casting suspicion on the relationship between agricultural producers and their farm workers , is creating a negative perception and this side of the house condemns that most strongly .
sir , i want to remind hon members once again that a man has died as a result of the poor circumstances experienced on the farm of da council member mr johan vogt .
] for the information of the hon member mr gelderblom , on that farm people may not even wear an anc cap or an anc t-shirt because then they are chased off the farm .
in 1998 the suzman foundation carried out research and found that 93 % of all farm workers described their relationship between them and their employers as very good , good and reasonable .
the committee therefore recommends that the provincial administration , as a matter of urgency , bring this matter to the attention of the national department of provincial affairs and local government and request them to -
( c ) finalise the guidelines , regulations and procedures to be followed by the newly demarcated municipalities after the elections in determining the remuneration and fringe benefits of their employees .
( d ) the compliance with legal requirements when companies or close corporations are formed , as well as the possibility of a relationship and dual directorship / ownership between the relevant companies , be investigated ;
it could be argued that these provisions also infringe on the functional and institutional integrity of the province as contained in section 41 ( g ) of the national constitution .
a request for ex post facto approval of the transaction was refused by the tender board on the grounds that it was not an emergency , nor was it in the best interest of the province .
hon members on both sides of the house should also learn that when we are in committee stage , the ruling of three questions per member should not be abused or exploited wilfully .
mr speaker , on a point of order : is it permissible for the hon minister of social services and poverty relief to depart totally from the subject before the house ?
it should therefore be quite clear to the hon member mr n m isaacs that it was never the intention of the national government to compensate public servants monetarily .
mr speaker , i am taking part in the debate today to raise a few fundamental issues in order to create a better life for all the people of the province .
so often one gives the hon ministers credit but very little credit goes to the departments which are the backstage to what happens in the ministerial offices .
before i get to what i would really like to deal with today , let me say as an introduction that the hon premier dealt with many critical issues , but i wish to mention only two .
we need to start inviting people like ted turner and bill gates , entrepreneurs who can bring their skills into this country and start educating people about business skills .
we are referring to the inescapable fact of the oppression and exploitation of women - a central platform of transformation since the collapse of apartheid , and it is not even mentioned .
i want to draw the attention of the house to the issue of how soon voters lose confidence in their leaders , especially leaders who are unable to deliver .
mr speaker , it is a fact that when we wanted to introduce pre-emptive rights at minmec , we heard that they were unconstitutional and infringed upon human rights , and so on .
mr speaker , the anc 's problem of a lack of consultation with its voters at grass-roots level and its autocratic management style will increasingly alienate voters .
i detect something of a will to want to work together with the opposition and local government , and some of the people who are traditionally hostile to the da government in this province .
it is a mobilisation based largely on swart gevaar in a new form - whether it is about rates , about zimbabwe or about crime .
we just see it when we drive past on the n2 - some of us , that is - and get a glimpse of the horror that exists behind the wall .
it is a pity that the hon minister of community safety and the hon minister of education are not here , because they were boasting so much about matric passes and so on .
many people focus on manenberg , and if we really are to change the condition of the poor people and we can do it in manenberg , then we will become the first province in this country .
the only thing that we can do in this country is , as the hon member mr ozinsky tried to say , to find one another across the dividing lines of colour .
in his opening address , the hon premier set out a vision in which the opposition can undoubtedly have a part , thus making the western cape a better place for all its people .
regarding economic growth as the second priority , it is illuminating to see that our capital funds are being utilised for the upgrading and maintenance of our primary provincial routes , precisely those roads on which the economy depends .
mr speaker , sport teaches the child to be sociable ; it teaches the child to be punctual ; and it teaches the child to be obedient , respectful and tolerant .
all this can be realised by positioning the anc as the only legitimate and committed party , which will , together with the national government , fight to address these issues .
mr speaker , the constitution protects the rights of the child , but in this province preferential treatment is still the order of the day , as it was in the old apartheid days .
i would like to refer to the run-up to the election , when we really tried to achieve cooperation with different institutions in south africa , and in the western cape in particular .
when i established the unicity commission in november 1999 , and also the district transformation forums , they were really there to advise me on the process of transformation .
they should know that i am determined to keep the work of this government focused , with the intensity of a laser beam , on the business of delivering to all our people .
by suggesting that there would be an outcry amongst muslims if a muslim learner was referred to herzlia , the hon minister is insulting the whole muslim community .
my second question is , are there enough common goals to bind the governing coalition for it to continue to function effectively as a multiparty government in our democracy ?
mr speaker , i would like to quote a letter quoted in the cape argus dated 10 february by mr thai mbes that was addressed to the hon premier .
i do not want to preach , but in philippians it is described very well where it is stated that christ went out and identified himself with those he wanted to win .
this overwhelming preference for the western cape must undoubtedly be interpreted as a motion of confidence in the governance that we practice in this province under the premiership of mr gerald morkel .
] to this end , the hon premier mentioned the job opportunities in the tourism , retail and service sectors , which should include opportunities for the youth , disabled people and women .
mr speaker , on a point of order : i would like to raise a point of order in terms of rule 69 ( 1 ) of the standing rules which states , and i quote :
is the anc perhaps focusing on breaking up the coalition because its fears losing even more support as a result of the performance of this government ?
mr speaker , people are already receiving tangible benefits from the government in a way that they have never received them before , even when this was a government of provincial unity .
it is not as far away from them as they believe . it is in the trains , buses , taxis , pick ' n pays , spurs , and so on .
it is therefore excellent that this province said that they were going to give the money to the poor people - r15 for a set of photographs and r5 for the identity document application .
the hon premier spoke about the achievements of the provincial government , yet he said that the people are asking him why he has not informed them about these achievements .
madam speaker , the truth is it is the elite who are praising the government ; they benefited in the past , and they are currently still benefiting from the unholy coalition .
when the hon premier failed to address crime , which seems to be endemic in our province , he shifted the responsibility to the national government .
madam speaker , we still do not know how many staff members of this administration were used , where they were deployed to , including the teachers , and what the consequences of that was .
during my speech i would like to refer to some aspects of this statement , and i would like to ask the messenger to make these copies available to hon members .
however , hon members from the new np should know that in many communities there are many whites - afrikaners who are affected by poverty - that are turning to the anc .
their contribution is perhaps not as eloquent or as sophisticated as the contribution of the hon minister of education , but they make a contribution and we need that contribution .
i would like to state clearly that i have not even spoken to rev sampson this year and i do not know who invited him to the house .
mr speaker , everyone knows that rural people are among the poorest of the poor and that their children often attend farm schools - the hon member ms brown has just spoken about that .
" this is the view of many other principals who said in a recent departmental survey that up to 95 % of the learners in their schools were from the eastern cape .
] it will not be long before these people realise the truth of their situation , just like the voters of zimbabwe are beginning to realise the truth of theirs .
] if i have to join ms pandor in rebuking the hon premier , i would do so simply from the point of view that he should have mentioned these good points .
i can now report that after their first festive season i received letters of congratulations from various tourist bodies and hotels , saying what an outstanding job of work they did .
mr speaker , in the hon premier 's speech it is clear that he does not recognise the fact that there has been a national call in connection with hiv / aids .
and then the hon leader of the anc accused the hon premier of having no feeling for the poor or for the implications of the situation for our communities !
this project will also improve the management of aids patients who present at the khayelitsha community health centres , the provision of home-based care and the training of medical staff in dealing with aids patients .
the majority of those clinics are in the surroundings of the metropole and there is no chance that one can go to primary health care clinics in the rural areas on foot .
madam speaker , according to the south african review , a security report by the institute of race relations , we top the international charts with violent crimes such as murder , rape and armed robbery .
there has been precious little training and this affects ordinary citizens every day ; they are the victims of rape and murder and still have to deal with gross incompetence in the criminal justice system .
i assure the hon member mr a j williams that this did not happen 10 years go , and i assure the hon member mr gelderblom that it did not happen 20 years ago .
although it is not a point of order , i ask all hon members to please try and pronounce the surname of the hon member mr gelderblom correctly .
i know that that will draw a comment from the other side of the house , but i genuinely do not believe that i , or we , have been effective over the past few days .
in alignment with these policies , the western cape treasury embarked on a new process of public consultation during the current financial year which has resulted in a western cape revenue and expenditure policy framework .
thus , while personnel numbers have fallen roughly from 90 000 in 1995-96 to 70 000 in 2000-01 , gross personnel expenditure has risen from approximately r5 billion to approximately r6 billion in the same period .
as will be seen from the tables attached to the documentation tabled today , total expenditure to be voted on in this budget amounts to r11,288 billion .
it has been estimated that 22,3 % of the children in western cape schools are from poor families , even though drop-out rates among this segment of the school-going population are reportedly still too high .
the loss of life and property , the human suffering and the many dramas which have unfolded have touched us all very deeply , as has the excellent performance of our air force .
the committee takes cognisance of the fact that an audit of provincial land has been completed by the department and would like to encourage the department to identify land for rapid release .
mr speaker , the new np in the western cape parliament is proud of the professional way in which the policies laid down in the budget of the various departments can now be implemented .
the hon minister of finance and development planning makes a promise in his 100-day speech , but then says sorry , we cannot come up with the policy ; we are waiting for the national government .
do hon members know that in 1997 the amount involved in the brain drain from south africa totalled r67 billion in revenue - because of the crime situation !
however , there is a tendency in scof - while the committee can only make recommendations , the poor officials are so intimidated with questions that they regard the scof meetings as a grilling .
mr speaker , a move on the speakers ' list that should have been a matter of convenience , seems to have thrown the speech of the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism out a little !
mr speaker , there was a time when the major debates in the house were about whether we should be investing in primary health care or whether we should be doing free health care .
i would have liked to ask for its postponement , because i really feel that it is not a day of joy for me without some proper attack from those benches over there .
i really think that the opposition has been very weak in its performance and i feel that if the hon member ms essop had been present today , it would have been a far better performance .
i said in my speech on 6 december 1999 , after i had taken the matter to cabinet for approval , that that r10 million was subject - read my lips - to cabinet approval .
this department comprises the following : the office of the premier , the office of the director-general , corporate services , the internal audit component and the hon minister in the office of the premier .
the new look is part of the new restructured administration into nine departments , run by an effective executive - our coalition cabinet , which is in turn advised by the director-general .
madam chairperson , the coalition government 's promise to the people to set out our programme for governance within 100 days was done well before the deadline in september last year .
in 1997 and 1998 , amendments to the public service act were aimed to overcome the centralisation of the public service by shifting the control of work organisation , where necessary , to executing authorities .
reform is included as one of the key performance areas in each and every senior manager 's performance agreement , and i have heard at scof and again today that the standing committee has called for the performance agreements .
is there anyone on both sides of the house who is of the opinion that we have less people in this province today than we had with the last population census ?
it is enabling thousands of disabled persons to participate in the labour market more productively and be penalised less for their enforced immobility , for which they are not responsible .
i would also like to thank mr johan coetzee , scof 's committee clerk , for his excellent coordination of all the meetings , his patience and efficient management , his support and thorough professionalism throughout .
this morning the offices of the premier , the director-general and the hon minister in the office of the premier provided some insight into their initiatives around hiv / aids .
select the right people , reward them for hard work and hold them fully accountable for their actions , subjecting the quality of their work to the discipline of the market-place ;
it is far more important that where public employees interact with the public , as they do in all public hospitals , schools , welfare offices , pension pay points and police stations , service is efficient , effective and courteous ;
madam chairperson , since the 1994 election neither the former minister nor the present hon minister concerned with youth affairs have been able to deliver to meet the demand for a provincial youth commission .
it was indicated in the standing committee that this youth desk is being hampered by the lack of administrative backup and capacity , which clearly indicate her lack of commitment to youth affairs .
if this money was available from casino funds only at the beginning of december , it is an acceptable explanation that the appropriation of the money should not have been finalised by february .
could i ask hon members to allow the hon minister an opportunity to present her reply to the house without a verbal duel from one side of the house to the other .
with regard to programmes , events and the beijing platform of action , the hon member phenduka said that she had heard people saying that i do not have a business plan .
i do not want the dignity of this house to be destroyed by a shouting match , nor do i want people to interrupt one another unnecessarily .
i want to thank the hon members on this side of the house for their contribution , and i even want to thank the small contribution that came from that side .
as i have told the president of this country , and as i have told the other premiers , i work well with the president and with the other premiers .
i say that because it was very convenient , regarding my opening address , for the anc to mention two particular topics , after i had already been speaking about aids and poverty relief for months .
i believe that the time will come , if they can really say and believe that they are working in the interests of all the people of this province , that we can get on with it .
] she said , in a very snide manner , that it seemed that these were the only provinces in the world that the new np and the dp could get an agreement with .
the committee takes cognisance of the fact that an audit of provincial land has been completed by the department and would like to encourage the department to identify land for rapid release .
our research and information service has been further formalised this year in that the two posts of researcher which were previously funded on contract by the european union have now been accommodated in our establishment as permanent posts .
i want to assure hon members that to secure a parliament on the sixth floor and members on the fourth and fifth floors properly , in our situation , is not actually possible .
last week the rules committee also decided to appoint a subcommittee , whose primary goal should be moving the focus more directly onto this house .
on the contrary , it is my intention that members of this house should be empowered in such a way that they are put in a position to provide services outside parliament as effectively as possible .
on the face of it - or prima facie , as the learned people would have it - the rules do give the standing committees quite comprehensive powers with regard to their oversight functions .
hon members will therefore be able to invite the former members in their parties to join them at the tables in those parts of the dining room set aside for the parties concerned .
we might even be so busy with a sitting that we have no one to send as a delegate to a conference , and then we can bring in one of the former members to help us out .
i must , however , agree with the hon member mr williams on the issue - i thought that that was his argument - that parliament cannot change money bills .
mr speaker , may i add that we now sit with an appeal on the table to the national minister of environmental affairs which is a very strong appeal against the development .
the best approach would probably be , in the end , to say that any person would simply be applying for an id , as happened in the cape metropolitan council .
seeing that the hon member mr dugmore spends a great deal of time in the editor 's office of that specific newspaper , that often refuses to print a retraction one way or the other , ...
an integral part of attending to complaints from consumers at the offices of the department are to provide education to such consumers .
( c ) out of the 16 officials , 15 officials worked for the period 5 to 7 march 1999 , and in that period they each received an amount of r1 000 .
( 1 ) whether the department has a programme in place to assess sexual offenders in order to determine whether or not they are too dangerous to be released ; if so ,
we do want to uphold the dignity of the house - i heard that myself - and accordingly i call upon the hon premier not to do that .
] as hon members on that side of the house often point out to us , i would like to point out to them that this is the type of thing that is happening with their coalition partners .
all of a sudden the hon member mr byneveldt imputes to me several duties that i do not have , and speaks about incidents in which i supposedly failed to act .
( 2 ) - ( 3 ) the west coast district council is responsible for the enforcing of conditions and has been requested by the pawc to do so .
( 1 ) no , the west coast district council cannot enter into a legally binding agreement without the approval of the executive committee of the full sitting of the council .
mr speaker , i would like to answer the hon member , but given that i have simply been asked to respond on behalf of my colleague here , i will pass the question on to him .
it must also be taken into account that some of the members of parliament seldom use the wale street entrances , but prefer the 5th floor turnstile .
farming and job creation by the smmes we have built bridges not only for the government but also for our people so that we can begin with mutual trading and investment .
he has indicated that the forensic audit will deal with the smartie town and herandien issue with the public defender , as he calls him - he is actually the public protector .
the owners of the impounded vehicles should be forced to commit themselves to strict discipline , accepting the rule of law and forsaking their acts of violence and intimidation .
i want to extend my thanks to all the role-players who were involved in bringing about peace and order in place of the killing and intimidation that clouded the western cape .
clause 1 of that bill provided for the insertion of section 30b in the road transportation act , 1977 , and gave the minister the powers to deal with these issues .
i certainly think that we are committed to making it work , but the fact is that we are negotiating issues which are very difficult , like subsidies in the transport industry .
] that school is the pride of the community in beaufort west and did so well in the matric results last year that they got r100 000 worth of computer equipment .
the earliest proposed date for the implementation of regulations of the western cape planning and development act , it seems to me - i will try to bring it forward - is april 2001 .
our support to these projects also differs according to the circumstances within the specific community and / or the project , and range from the initiation of such projects , to training , extension and financial support .
( e ) the majority of medicine stock-outs were due to problems in the supply of drugs from manufacturers and cash flow problems experienced in the cmd itself .
i will soon be making positive announcements about extending the mother to child project in this province and will be approaching cabinet with firm recommendations around the establishment of a provincial aids council .
it is not my intention to deal with a matter such as that based on rumour or the " if it is found " type of situation .
the 93 properties which accrue to the provincial government of the western cape , are mainly used as experimental and training farms , nature reserves , office buildings for provincial departments and the legislator and for educational purposes .
thirdly , our province has just received the award for the best health services in the country , and now the hon member mr stali comes with petty little things like that .
however , we have now received information that there are people who are using the subsidised ticket that is supposed to be used on the khayelitsha-cape town route for commuting from mitchells plain .
mr speaker , on 20 june 2000 i put a formal question to the hon minister of transport , sport and recreation on this same matter of subsidy payments and alleged corruption .
only in october 1998 did the cabinet finally decide that they would consider implementing the ten point plan that the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism talked about .
the rest of the country has been applying black business empowerment through a preferential procurement system since 1996 ; they have not waited for regulations .
( 2 ) ( i ) the actual figure allocated for building a convention centre is r320 million and not , as stated by the questioner , r360 million .
this includes the appointment of new staff and upgrading community health centres by adding a store to each one , with a provision service officer in charge of ordering medicines .
the submission to cabinet includes a wide range of government and civil society stakeholders , and i hope that the provincial aids council will be a unifying forum where we can all jointly tackle the aids epidemic .
as i have said in my answer to him , the western cape tourism board , which included cape town tourism and cape metropolitan tourism , had nothing to do with the organisation whatsoever .
( 3 ) whether the department of correctional services re-arrested all those prisoners who committed serious crimes and that were erroneously released in the province ; and
( 1 ) how many schools in the province have been provided with first aid kits in view of national schools hiv / aids week that took place from 4 to 10 september 2000 ;
the national policy on hiv / aids for learners , students and educators states in article 7 that all schools and institutions should ideally have available at least two first aid kits .
what happens is this : if hon members know how pmr works , they will know that they have independent surveys by businessmen in all the departments and they then publish the results .
similarly , through the good work of the saps and others , those allegedly responsible for the bombings that plagued our city have been arrested and brought to trial .
as a result of the fact that poverty relief does not yet have a business plan and that the funds for the poverty relief programme have been transferred to vote 1 , we could not discuss it .
vote 10 is the hon minister 's responsibility , as well as mine as chairperson of the standing committee , and i suppose this is the greatest roll-over so far - r127 million .
hon members also all know that we have a convention in accordance with which we grant the hon premier and the hon leader of the opposition an exceptional degree of silence to put their case .
a judge will judge him and his party on whether they have been an effective opposition , or whether they have simply attempted to withhold the much needed revenue of our gaming industry from our people .
the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs informed me today that after consultation with the cmc , the community and the department of water affairs the eia has been approved with certain regulations .
the blame has always been ascribed to urbanisation and people coming in , and the hon minister said this again today when he referred to the holding capacity of the sewage dams .
the vast majority of bomb threats are hoax threats often made by schoolchildren to try to evacuate school premises , as well as many other people who are possibly of unsound mind .
( 2 ) movable property , which forms part of the state 's assets , was not sold but transferred to the schools where the learners were placed or to needy schools .
however , as far as i am concerned , the information that i have at my disposal at the moment is that access to 4x4 vehicles has been given to the residents there only for a certain area of the beach .
] it sounded like a statement to me , but i agree that whoever is responsible should be made to rehabilitate and pay for the rehabilitation .
mr speaker , at the opening of parliament , i extended a hand of friendship to hon members on that side of the house and they shook their heads .
at a meeting with president thabo mbeki , the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism and the director-general , this was one of the things we put on the table .
madam chairperson , during the past year the department of finance has continued implementing the policy goals and strategic objectives which were outlined in my policy speech on 16 september 1999 .
regarding capacity-building in other departments , senior officials of the department of finance have lectured students enrolled in the senior and financial management courses at the provincial administrative academy .
on the income front we will also liaise with the western cape gambling and racing board in order to promote sound financial administration which will enhance the maximisation of revenue for the province .
for too long since 1994 have we allowed certain whites - i am not a racist , but i have to say it - to stand guard in front of the true gates to freedom .
hopefully the hon minister of finance and development planning can reply to this immediately , especially in the light of the comments made by the hon member mr ismail and presumably by others later .
without own revenue , we will be unable to upgrade our infrastructure and we will be held back in terms of competing on the international market for sustainable foreign investment .
madam chairperson , i am sorry that the words from the anc caused the hon member mr louis 's blood pressure to rise so high and his morale so low !
just as i have said to the hon member mr gabru , i say to the hon member mr n m isaacs that i would be delighted to see that information .
if it is information that should go directly to the gambling board , i will facilitate any of that information going there , because i do not interfere in the activities of the gambling board .
by admission many more would close if the more that 3 700 reservists and 400 privately sponsored rent-a-cops were withdrawn for one reason or the other .
when cabinet announced its 100 day plan , the department of community safety categorised its work in three broad categories : mobilising the community , rearming the community and performance audits .
mobilising the community is important in that the people of the western cape have already showed their great capacity to become involved , for instance in both the manenberg tornado disaster and the recent mountain fires .
we used minor sensitising methods , such as key-rings , of which every hon member has one in his / her folder and on which there is a " designate a driver " label .
to come back to what the hon minister said , the responsibility of fighting crime rests not only on the police but also on us as the man in the street .
let me present the evidence against the hon minister : thabo mabaso lost his eye at the guguletu police station ; comm daniels issues the order that members on duty during the incident be transferred .
i wish them everything of the best with this pilot project , the ultimate objective of which is , particularly when our funding situation improves , to launch similar mini-madam projects in all areas and communities .
he mentioned the success of this operation and felt that it confirmed to the public of the western cape that the morale of the police is intact .
madam chairperson , i have also noted with amusement the various anti-crime strategies and crime prevention programmes that the hon minister spoke about - there is basically a programme for every kind of crime .
madam chairperson , it was encouraging to see that the people of the western cape province came out en masse yesterday to make a firm stand against the ongoing violence .
madam chairperson , with the commitment and determination of the hon minister and his department , this baby - which i will nickname " markie " - will soon develop ...
not once during their whole contribution to this debate have they remarked on the contribution of the national government and it constitutional role with regard to policing in this country .
that muizenberg and diep river police stations are 60 % under strength , that nyanga police station is 19 % under strength , that 40 % of the supposed vehicle fleet does not even exist ...
one cannot speak in this jekyll and hyde fashion of , on the one hand , saying what a great job they are doing and condemning them on the other .
the hon member mr mckenzie talks about the cpos , while he was peripherally involved in the original idea , but had nothing to do with the implementation thereof .
however , i think that in my attack on the anc i have already referred to the fact that the vast majority of the resources are already in the areas where crime occurs most .
in the december-january school holidays my directorate also successfully hosted the safe haven project , which coached young persons in a variety of sport in a safe environment , under police supervision , normally in conjunction with local community police forums .
the directorate , in conjunction with the national department of sport and recreation , had two projects in ocean view and mfuleni which attracted hundreds of kids who took part in the projects .
unfortunately the media only focus on sports with a high profile , and the sports administrator - or as they are commonly known , the " officials " - receive so little recognition .
rather than assisting local authorities to upgrade existing facilities , it would be highly appreciated if an audit could be done in respect of facilities .
one finds in a number of our townships that only the children who attend school are keen about sport and sports bodies that are in operation , but there is no encouragement at all .
i like the aim of this department in reconstructing development in the western cape , especially with a view to improving the life of the disadvantaged , women and the disabled .
we are taking the lead in trying to coordinate the three major role-players in school sports to see if we cannot come to a workable arrangement in this regard .
" i want to repeat that , " we have no reason to complain until we take pride in our own country " , and obviously in this province also .
the economist intelligence unit , a british quarterly journal , in a survey of expected international economic growth rates , predicts that south africa is well on its way to becoming a de facto one-party state .
as they are aware , the western cape finance bill being tabled today originally formed part of the western cape second finance bill which was tabled in the house late last year .
it deals with the authorisation of expenditure amounting to r199 452,80 and r2,82 million in respect of assistance to the independent electoral commission ( iec ) for the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 financial years respectively .
in the field of more productivity and greater efficiency , i must make special mention of mr andries van niekerk : financial manager , whose gentle but firm guidance has been central to this achievement .
today i would like to make a point about another crucial assumption - that most people are inherently agents and not victims , whatever the circumstances of their history .
we are also initiating a women in science and technology project to encourage girls to choose and stick with these subjects , but this is very much in the planning stages .
with the considerable savings we achieve in this process , we will expand technical and vocational education and develop new curricular options for students who do not wish to follow traditional academic routes .
despite the excellent work of my colleagues in curricular management , the demands on this section exceed the available resources and we must seek to correct this situation .
by march 1999 the project had approached 83 schools that were being protected through an inefficient and ineffective system of security guards , and introduced them to an innovative development called bridge the fence .
the wced then allocated an additional r3,1 million to the project and 242 schools were given a first line of defence through alarm systems linked to an armed response .
for example , it is absurd that we are compelled to continue employing and paying 50 staff in an institution that does not have a single pupil .
then , sir , i wish to thank the head of department , mr brian o ' connell , and his team for their contribution towards making a success of education in the western cape .
i should appreciate it if the hon minister of education would just give a clear standpoint in this house in that regard so that we can all be clear about this .
the difficulties encountered in the implementation of curriculum 2005 clearly demonstrate this , and the national minister of education 's appointment of a review committee is to be welcomed in this regard .
one of them asked me - it was a principal who asked this - if they would have behaved like this if a school like pinelands had been involved .
when we asked them about the amalgamation of former model c schools and former house of representatives schools in the rural areas , then they seemed to understand it .
the transformation of education and , more , the transformation of the thinking patterns on education in which people are trapped , is a logical consequence of the coming of democracy in this country .
i would also like to take the same opportunity to thank mr brian o ' connell and his whole department for their continuous dedication and the hard work that they do in education .
that the house welcomes the fifa delegation to cape town and expresses the hope that the visit will favourably add to a positive decision in awarding south africa the world cup soccer tournament in 2006 .
the budget for academic hospitals has therefore been increased by 6,8 % , despite the fact that the nationally-funded central hospitals grant increases by less than 1 % in the new financial year .
an initiative of this kind will certainly succeed since the staff , the patients and the visitors that pass through tygerberg hospital daily have the buying power of a relatively large town in the western cape .
thirdly , i appeal to the local newspapers and other media to participate in sensitising the population at risk to go for this preventative flu vaccination .
budget speeches are about how one is going to do it , because they take an intention and measure it against the finances , the staff , and the equipment and material that one has .
if the hon leader of the opposition reads my speech - i will send him a copy - he will see in the annexure that this is a very good vote .
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 2 - provincial parliament of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1999 [ pr 15 / 2000 ] .
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 14 - provincial service commission of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1999 [ pr 9 / 2000 ] .
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 7 - corporate services of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1998 [ pr 124 / 1999 ] .
an organisation will not just be funded because of the organisation , but because of the specific outcomes , that is that it can really perform and be measured and monitored .
they need to address the needs of the community and therefore hon members will see that they are unique in size , facility and , of course , in the nature of the services .
as the formulation of strategic alliances with other role-players is crucial to driving a comprehensive goal-orientated process , social services participates , as a role-player , in the south african civil military alliance .
these institutions are not integrated , and unless we have something very similar to the health facilities bill to manage this department , we will not be able to care for the aged .
mr chairperson , the national department of welfare failed to spend not r10 million , but r353 million of the r450 million budget in the 1998-99 financial year .
however , despite the virtuous economic framework that has been created , millions of south africans live in dire poverty and , as i have said , over 1 million people have lost their jobs since 1994 .
madam chairperson , when trying to unravel the details of subprogramme : poverty relief , the question i asked myself was whether we were dealing with a desk or a directorate .
i also feel very happy to be part of the house after having heard the concerns and the worries expressed by hon members regarding the plight of the poor .
the leadership of this department has been the most eloquent answer to those , particularly from the dp , who believe that any elevation of people of colour to senior levels is , ipso facto , a lowering of standards .
i am shocked to read in the newspapers that approximately 40 % of the total national funding of aids has thus far not been used .
i have the same problem with the motion of the hon member mr ramatlakane , that he moves a motion without notice , while he is actually motivating the motion .
these business plans included current approved projects that are in the process of development and in respect of which we are contractually committed , as well as projects that will be initiated within this period .
at the beginning of the year the national department of housing indicated that the funds allocation to this province would be reduced by one third to r238 million .
this is particularly critical , given the fact that the provincial housing development board has to date received 74 projects to the value of r754 million that cannot be approved due to the lack of funds .
we effectively grant assistance to persons who have no source of income and change their living conditions from shack-dwellers to home-owners , but we cannot guarantee that they will remain home-owners .
whereas in the past builders of subsidy houses were excluded from having to register with the national home builders registration council , this legislation now makes it imperative for such builders to be registered with the council .
we were also told that within the metropole the housing plans and information are available on a gis system , but to date the city of cape town has yet to submit their plan .
] when we fight elections - i will give him examples - the people are told , " if you do not vote for us , you will not get a house .
i propose that he write to that anc-controlled council and tell them that that is what the people are now demanding , and then come back to me .
for me , however , it is the most critical one at this stage , so we will spend a little longer on it . i am referring to the transformation of local government and what is happening in that regard .
to elaborate on this , i can mention that we want to modernise the way in which we work regarding the systems we use , the way in which we interact with customers and the revolution of efficiency .
one is that i do not want the names of political leaders , whether living or dead .
that is why we want to appoint someone , not just to arrange the first meeting of the council , but also to keep the processes going over the first week or two .
madam chairperson , this is why we are asking the hon minister of local government what he is doing in terms of local government culture to help those who are impoverished in the community .
it is getting tiring , and i think they are beginning to understand that there are other politicians and other political parties in south africa that can deliver more effectively than what they can at local level .
to assume a uniform system of delivery norm on a countrywide basis , is as unrealistic as assuming that every pupil writing matric will get straight a ' s .
however , the process of transition is fraught with problems and it is these that i wish to highlight as part of this province 's ongoing objective to provide a network of effective local government infrastructures .
there can be no asset stripping , as the last thing we need is for a new unicity to arrive which has been plundered and is instantly non-viable .
madam chairperson , thirdly , i am pleased the hon minister alluded to this in his speech , but are we adequately addressing the problem surrounding the role of labour in the new dispensation ?
madam chairperson , the third point that i wish to discuss is something that i have mentioned before in this house , and that is the issue of capacity-building in and assistance to municipalities .
these funds are voted on the budget of the national department of constitutional development and are intended for the installation of bulk connector infrastructure , green-field development and the upgrading of infrastructures .
the kind of government that will emerge in the unicity and in the local governments will , i believe , determine the quality of service delivery and exactly who is prioritised for that service delivery .
the days are past when we could tell one another that we would bring out a provincial law and indicate to the national government that we were going to do so - come what may , it had to happen .
apart from the provincial development council , there are several statutory bodies that in one way or another contribute to the broad developmental direction that the provincial government takes , or ought to take .
the need for a provincial inventory of all departmental datasets and databases , aimed at coordinating provincial information , has also been identified and the data is now being compiled on a spreadsheet .
survey data , regularly monitored as part of an ongoing process conducted by this province and local government , should serve as an indicating order to prioritise investment in service provision .
i want to state quite clearly that we know that there are hon members of this house , including former members of the cabinet , who have an interest in that land .
madam chairperson , when we talk about transformation in the department , we need to put it into the context of the figures that tell us exactly what the levels of representivity are .
i have a fear , and i raised this earlier , about the long delays we have in certain processes taking place , whether they are to do with regulations , laws , strategies or green papers .
an innovation brought about for the first time is the approval for expenditure of r806 000 on brown issues ; that is , issues directly affecting the quality of life of the people .
the language issue was again debated in the ncop , and i believe that as long as we have a true democracy it will continue to be debated , because it plays such an important role ...
it is precisely the libraries in the location that have to remain open while those in the town should be closed , to help in the process of integrating communities .
amongst them are aids in the workplace , aids prevention for a better future , awareness campaigns regarding hiv / aids and how the key measurable objectives can reflect an awareness of hiv / aids .
we also support the notion of youth camps to teach them the necessary life skills and educate them regarding hiv / aids , which was also referred to by a previous speaker .
i find that the long sentences used to question hon members continuously while they have the floor do not allow them to finish their speeches .
one weighs up and compares and ultimately , after careful consideration , one chooses ; and if in one 's considered opinion the result is obvious , the decision is very simple .
in the metropolitan area a very significant process , intended to fundamentally restructure public transport , began towards the end of last year and will continue for a further two years .
operational plans will be developed for each of the five regions in the province , focusing on specific issues of concern in the regions , and of the individual towns in these regions .
madam chairperson , i should like to convey a word of thanks to all the officials of this administration , particularly for their share in the success we have achieved in this province .
it is clear that this road has now reached its capacity to such an extent that there was no alternative but to give this important matter priority on the budget .
madam chairperson , the good news today is that for the first time in the 21 years that i have been appealing for this road , it is on the budget in full strength .
the anc message and pressure on the coalition is beginning to show results , to the extent that the hon minister is seen as the person to carry the flag in speaking this language .
in the mornings i am still seeing women with curlers in their heads taking the children to school in these government vehicles issued for official purposes .
mr chairperson , i would like to start off by congratulating the hon minister on his budget speech delivered here today .
the department is fortunate to have received these one-off payments , which go some way towards relieving the pressure of the backlog of r700 million to which the hon minister alluded today .
the r332 million generated from vehicle licences and special registration plates is very important in helping to make up the backlog of road maintenance and upgrading in the province .
while on the subject of road fatalities , it was only a few months ago that we debated the carnage on our roads , especially with regard to bus accidents .
he and his department form a formidable team that will cover a great many miles yet in this house and on this side for the new np and for the government of the western cape .
i want to remind the hon member mr mckenzie that the western cape province has a record of managing the province well , and the hon member shared in that record .
we must see to the needs of every single person living in the province - be he from blouwatergat or anywhere else , we shall look after him .
madam chairperson , i did not want to give the hon member the wrong information , and that is why i went to my official to make sure of the facts .
i do not want the moving of motions to deteriorate into a political battle which would make it impossible for us to move a motion in the house with sincerely good intentions .
they have indicated that the economic assistance from dti 's export marketing and investment assistance programme has been the single most important factor contributing to the success of the company .
in brief , we regard the western cape as a technology-driven regional economy , active in both creating and absorbing new knowledge in those industries in which we have a competitive advantage and are able to develop .
where the consumer protector finds the conduct giving rise to the complaint to constitute an unfair business practice and therefore to warrant intervention , the case will be presented to an independent administrative tribunal .
the hawston secondary school is one of seven schools in disadvantaged communities which made the best progress last year , and which is accordingly receiving r100 000 from the hon minister of education .
the elements of this strategic plan are , firstly , to build and grow the knowledge base within the western cape tourism board for use within the organisation and the industry as a whole .
i would like to test the view of the house regarding the desirability of a pilot study to establish the extent of hiv / aids awareness and training in businesses in our province .
" i want to state again in this house today , as i have done for the past three years , that i do not personally believe in selling off assets .
that is why the only time that we need valuations on property is when we sell the property , because the regulations state that we need an external valuer and an internal valuer .
the problem surrounding this particular tavern is that it is one of three legal taverns within the hornlee residential area , and that its owner is the brother of the anc mayor .
i know that this is on the hon minister 's programme , but what emerged from there was that the presenter specifically said that there would be consultation with the existing tourism bureaux .
in case we are accused of walking out , i would like to inform the house that some of us have been invited to a finger lunch on the first floor at 12 : 30 .
it is the convention in the national parliament that when they have committee discussions of this type , the other members of cabinet are not there ; they have work to do .
the party that i support , and this government as well , do not support a form of empowerment that puts people in places and positions which they are not able to fill at that particular point .
when i phone the sea point police station , which is so-called overstaffed , they say , " sorry , mr bester , it is not a priority crime , " because they have to deal with murders , rapes and so on .
in an effort to control the illegal sale of contaminated meat , veterinary services has launched a campaign in conjunction with the cape metropolitan council to establish abattoirs in informal settlements .
earlier i said that the challenge of our industry is to find a set of solutions for the paradox of modern technology on the one hand and unemployment on the other .
the anc supports the four key objectives of the western cape department of agriculture , namely the promotion of international competition , support of new emerging farmers , the promotion of manual labour and the conservation of resources .
when this ship arrived with the imported barley - i do not know whether the hon minister is aware of this - much of the barley was not suitable for malt .
i know that the hon minister said in the house that farmers and members of the town councils should come together to plan or discuss land for housing for the farm workers .
( 1 ) financial support for emerging business is a vital necessity for growing the smme sector , and that small businesses have encountered enormous difficulties in this regard ; and
( 2 ) that the said discontinuance results from concerted pressure by the above-mentioned communities , under the leadership of the anc , as part of the liberation of the province and the abolition of racism ;
" i want to repeat that , " we have no reason to complain until we take pride in our own country " , and obviously in this province also .
the economist intelligence unit , a british quarterly journal , in a survey of expected international economic growth rates , predicts that south africa is well on its way to becoming a de facto one-party state .
in these circumstances , and with the promise of significant support , i feel free to submit the western cape road transport act amendment bill to the house for speedy approval .
that is quite an important issue , that when representations are made , the minister has to listen to those representations , as long as they are within a period of no less than 24 hours .
one thing that one picks up at grassroots level is that the relationship of trust between the saps and the communities is not strong enough to make successful prosecutions of gang members possible .
in other words , they are not prepared to testify against their children except the protection network and in many instances also the support networks that extend to the community from specific gang members .
mr speaker , this brings me to probably , if not the largest , one of the largest dilemmas and hurdles that have to be crossed if we are going to tackle gangs successfully .
we have a situation where we succeed in a community in an agreement between two gangs being brokered by the church or the police in order to have peace in that community .
the hon member mr marais and i had to go and see the president of this country to put our case as strongly as possible , because they did not want to take it seriously .
what the people out there do not necessarily know is that the anc has a stated policy , which was circulated amongst all police stations and also amongst their own ranks , to take over cpfs .
l brown , c m dugmore , t essop , n m isaacs , a ismail , j p gelderblom , h a lewis ( chairperson ) , m louis , d silke , a e van zyl , a j williams
he should have asked the director-general of finance in this province to come to present the arguments that he has presented to the house today , because he repeated him almost verbatim .
mr speaker , it is doubly strange that when the province wishes to assist in promoting democracy , because of a poorly managed voter registration process , we are severely criticised for doing so .
why can we not call on the iec to give evidence about what kind of calls were made , what their powers and functions were and why they were not adequately fulfilled ?
that the hon member mr silke uncharacteristically , and like a jelly fish - not a jelly bean , with respect - said nothing at all in scof ; he kept quiet .
" that message continued to be sent out right up until they lost the court case , which shows that the hon member mr silke should be reading his constitution a little more finely .
i would like to know under the programme : management and administration , which subprogramme this expenditure came from and how the savings were managed in a department that is constantly looking for more money ?
i am taking full responsibility to stand in here today , but i do not know and i do not know how many health officials volunteered to be compensated for their time .
madam chairperson , it appears that we will have to ask the hon minister of health questions under vote 12 then , because he clearly did apply his mind to vote 12 by what he says .
madam chairperson , on a point of order : i do not believe a question can be directed to me when questions are being put on a particular vote of the respective minister .
can the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs tell us whether that department no longer needs that money , as he is prepared to give his money away on unauthorised expenditure ?
if there are irregularities in the expenditure details i will definitely take it up , but i am not too sure about how i could address the vote made earlier .
at a time when this province has had to lose 8 000 teachers because of financial constraints , the national government has voted r150 million to pay for 100 teachers not to teach .
madam chairperson , it is actually very concerning that in the current financial year , when one 's knowledge is still very fresh , the hon premier does not know the details .
madam chairperson , i surely would have thought it would be the accounting officer and his officials , because we said a maximum of r1 000 for 5 , 6 and 7 march .
the suggestion by the hon leader of the opposition in regard to my conduct in the matter , i believe that i will require time to accurately answer the questions .
all i know , and i am assured of this by mr fourie , is that there was an agreement at the start that any money disbursed from education would be reimbursed .
the agreement , which we assume was entered into at almost the start of the financial year , let us say 1 april 1999 , was that at the end of the financial year they were going to save ...
the ruling in the past has been that if a member puts a question on the question paper , it will be answered officially in the house by the minister as he / she wishes .
that the house notes with concern that the present nnp / dp government in the province has failed to protect the motorists and pedestrians on the n2 freeway .
outside of this urban renewal strategy there can be little for discussion between the hon premier and the mayor of cape town , mr marais , and that does not refer to their personal relationship .
the hon premier crafted a speech - some would credit ryan coetzee for it - in which few would argue with the broad vision and priorities .
that is an incredible opportunity which we must use to restructure fragmented services , to ensure equitable redistribution of resources and to augment the crime prevention capacity of our police service .
it is also a fact that in large parts of the province this problem is aggravated at present by the detrimental effect of the drought on certain core industries in the province .
for me the key measurable objectives of this strategic plan will be my focus , as this is where the impact on the community can and will be measured and is visible .
" i think this is what the western cape government will have to endeavour to do - to help those who wish to be assisted and who also do something about their own plight .
this banner is also displayed against a background of , " hang murderers and rapists " , " no mercy for criminals " , " nail them , jail them " , and , " tackle crime " .
all of us in this house have the responsibility to ensure that nothing will threaten the creation of these opportunities for farm workers and their children that the hon premier is working towards .
that will enable us to consider the mechanisms we shall use to determine how we will be able to achieve these objectives in the coming year .
mr speaker , da councils , with no sanction from the hon minister of housing , are proceeding to sell rdp houses on auction to the highest bidder leaving the most vulnerable people homeless .
it is a damning indictment on the province that despite the fact that national legislation exists and regulations are in place , the province has not established a rent tribunal .
] there , many people are very concerned that the malpractices of past anc-driven developments will be continued and entrenched and they have reason to be concerned , because there is corruption going on there .
i would like to thank the iec for its cooperation in implementing our time on task policies , but particularly those educators who were prepared to make the sacrifice for the benefit of their learners .
the hon premier , despite his assertions , is not confident and is concerned , saying that he is the premier " of all the people of the western cape " .
fortunately the chairperson of the rdp at the time the process was started was a mr noludwe , but he is no longer the chairperson of the rdp there .
] the hon minister may be correct because , as i said in her absence , the chairperson of the rdp at the time the consultations were started was mr noludwe .
mr speaker , in spite of a promise by president mbeki that he will not tolerate any corrupt councillors , it seems that this promise will also be thrown to the wind .
mr speaker , on tuesday , 22 august 2000 the hon member mr dugmore moved the following motion in the house , and i quote from hansard : western cape , vol 5 , p 1756 :
i want to refer briefly to what the hon leader of the opposition said and to his careful analysis of the shortcomings and deficiencies in the opening address of the hon premier yesterday .
the epicentre of the counter-force that hinders our best efforts against hiv / aids is none other than last year 's futile debate on whether hiv causes aids or not .
unless and until hiv becomes the responsibility of every individual , until it becomes as self-evident as trying to stay healthy in general , we will be failing our country .
in the budget process last year we exposed that the then minister responsible - ms freda adams - had no plan for the use of this money .
if this sort of thing had to happen at the grandwest casino , i venture to suggest that the approximately r100 million in tax which we receive per year would be at great risk .
mr speaker , i move without notice : that the house notes the alleged corruption and unauthorised expenditure , as revealed in the west coast district council recently , with specific reference to -
what is happening at the moment is that there are up to 100 taxis coming into this province per week and taxi operators are paying codeta and cata up to r20 000 per month for a permit .
it seemed as if this little girl was stoically taking things in her stride ; understandably it was the older people who were more vociferous and more vocal about their rights .
at times , however , it seemed as if he wanted to take a backward step , particularly when other role-players began to put unreasonable or even unfeasible demands , and that he then did not want to enter into discussions with them .
the hon member who introduced the debate on this issue actually threw the issue out of the window by politicising it and drawing the anc into the picture .
he implied , in the same way that he did today , that it is the national minister of transport and the national anc government who are to blame for the crisis .
i am sure the press must be quite embarrassed at having to reflect how the hon minister has changed his mind on whether he is going to act or not .
( 2 ) the provincial administration approves the allocation of five sessions of five hours ( 25 hours per week ) for the district surgeon to ensure effective medical supervision of pma ;
the very potent combination - and i think it will come to pass - of the convention centre and the canal is really going to create a wonderful precinct down there and invigorate the central business district .
let me say that the next round of technology in conferencing will be for people to buy particular time periods of a conference over the internet and participate on-line in a conference .
it is interesting to note that over the past four years the province , the cmc and the city of cape town have been involved discussions to establish a convention centre of a world standard .
i think some people took part in the discussions with a little suspicion , and that is why they asked the auditor-general for his view on whether they were legally entitled to have it .
we believe that a world-class convention centre , a multipurpose convention centre in cape town - whether coupled with an exhibition centre or not - will substantially increase the gross regional product of the province .
for example , there can be raked seating for 1 500 to 2 000 delegates , plenary seating for 3 000 to 5 000 delegates , and a space for breakaways , trade shows , catering and so on .
with the development of a key facility here in cape town we will be able to host major international conferences which may have traditionally been staged in either europe or north america .
sir , the establishment of a world-class convention centre is an important milestone in the growing tourism industry of the western cape ; not only for the western cape , but also for the entire south africa and africa .
mr speaker , in case there is any doubt in the house , i would like to affirm - as the hon member mr r williams did - that the anc supports the convention centre .
mr speaker , i wanted to raise these issues in the committee meeting , but i was gagged by members in the meeting who indicated to the chairperson to keep me quiet .
we are treading on new terrain and i would encourage the hon minister to engage in discussion with the national treasury and find out if we are okay .
when i enquired of the hon minister whether mr stehlik recused himself , he said , " the man has expertise , and it is valuable expertise and we need it .
we were not given the opportunity to ask this question , but i am asking the hon minister now whether he has approval for zoning and land use , and who owns the land ?
in regard to the substance of the hon member 's argument , she did not address the core argument , and that is , one can amend current shareholders ' agreements and current convenco agreements .
as the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism has said , we all agreed to omit the word " shareholders " and to substitute it with the word " convenco " .
madam chairperson , on a point of order : is it not so that the house is being asked to approve this bill [ b9b-2000 ] as it stands before us ?
vote 1 - premier ( auditor-general 's report [ pr122 / 1999 - page 2 , paragraph 2.2.1 ( b ) ] ) : purchasing of goods and services - sound equipment
vote 16 - transport and public works ( auditor-general 's report [ pr87 / 1999 - page 13 , paragraph 3.11 ( a ) ( a ) ] ) : brackenfell regional traffic office : tender board approval
sir , this is one opportunity that the hon minister of local government had to gain the respect of all political parties , and not only the new np .
one of the points of departure of the udm in regard to this matter is that we cannot and will not cooperate with any system where power is centred in a person or group of persons .
another reason why the new np cannot support an executive mayor with executive powers is that minority interest groups will have little or no say in the decision-making process relating to funds .
] it is unthinkable that a council should designate an executive mayor because never during the election process has the voter had the opportunity to focus specifically on the choice of the mayor .
only an executive committee system based on proportional representation and appointed by the council and accountable to it ensures democracy and executive government at local government level .
the first point to which the hon member mr mckenzie referred was that the new np commissioners in a unicity , inter alia , also support the idea of an executive mayor , and that is not correct .
prof millner , as well as prof hugh corder of the university of cape town in his definitive work , judges at work , draws these conclusions after analysing a number of judgments in a variety of fields .
but just as those hon members want to see it within the context , they have to understand that judges of those times were obliged to enforce the laws of those times .
we stand for the principles and the integrity , and if there are opposition parties that share those principles with us then we shall hold discussions with them and this will be brought to fruition .
( 1 ) financial support for emerging business is a vital necessity for growing the small , medium and micro enterprises sector , and that small businesses have encountered enormous difficulties in this regard ; and
black businesses tell us in hearings that we have held that when they walk into a bank , the manager looks at their skin colour before he / she looks at their business proposal .
because the assessors came to look at his industrial property and said it was in an area of risk , athlone industria , and therefore they could not give him a loan .
we know that this is a problem , and we must congratulate black businesses on the fact that many of them have still succeeded in their struggle in this environment of adversity .
however , the difference is that the new np is not only focused on one section of the poor , because we say that there are white , brown and black poor people .
mr speaker , i rise to speak in this important debate regarding the role of the smmes and the treatment that they have been subjected to by banks for quite a while now .
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 10 - social services of the provincial administration : western cape of the year ended 31 march 1999 [ pr 81 / 2000 ] .
in some cases this has led to unauthorised expenditure due to the fact that the tender board refused or it was not within its power to provide ex post facto authority .
the committee has taken note of the circumstances which gave rise to the excess expenditure and recommends that the unauthorised expenditure of r18 216,48 be referred to the provincial parliament for authorisation .
let us use mitchells plain as an example , where properties have now been valued because it is a new area , and compare it to clifton where properties have not been valued since 1979 .
current anc local governments do not inspire confidence and it is therefore no surprise that ordinary residents of this city and elsewhere around the country are abhorred by potentially high rates .
] this has gone hand in hand with poor financial management on the part of many municipalities , and a lack of will to collect money that is owing to councils .
it wants to prevent anc-controlled councils to differentiate between areas to allow them to redress the inequalities which the hon member mr mckenzie has so eloquently spelt out here .
the national ministers of safety and security and defence must conduct ongoing discussions with agri sa so that active efforts can be made to end this meaningless loss of life .
on the same day that he was sentenced , another farmer was arrested in the riversdal district on a charge of having threatened a farm worker , ms hendrina january , with a firearm .
it is true that the 800 agriculturalists murdered in south africa since 1994 suggest a disturbing pattern that holds serious implications for law and order and ultimately for democracy .
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 15 - public works of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1999 [ pr 82 / 2000 ] .
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 13 - local government of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1999 [ pr 88 / 2000 ] .
the ad hoc committee , having considered the subject of the western cape fiscal policy , 2001- 2004 , referred to it , begs to report as follows :
another significant amendment is the fact that the law will authorise the forfeiture to the province of goods confiscated from illegal operators in instances where they admit their guilt .
sir , i wish to refer briefly to the amendment of section 27 of law 4 of 1996 , by which race course and race course premises licences have been removed from the series of different licences that a board may issue .
we cannot afford to turn a blind eye to illegal operators , and i hope that the recent actions in sea point will be extended to all illegal operations all over the western cape .
mr speaker , another key development contained in the bill is sharpening the accountability of the licence holder towards the board , vis--vis cheating within an operator 's establishment .
mr speaker , ms sandy barnes of the silvermine valley coalition , a civic organisation , was quoted in the cape times of 1 may 2000 as saying , and i quote :
he agreed that building plans and departure applications needed independent investigation , but he concluded that the information he received from the officials gave different signals .
] what is happening is that the voters will see the laziness with which these people are doing their work , because none of them participate in any other work of the house .
even the dp - and that is why they are so silent today - and even their provincial leader who fights against corruption and who wants things done are quiet today .
mr speaker , i would also draw hon members ' attention to what my colleague the hon minister of community safety mentioned , which is worthwhile re-emphasising .
that the house congratulates the staff of the provincial parliament for providing the minutes of proceedings and the order paper of the house in all three official languages of the province .
be it an objection to free abortion , resistance to homosexuality or whatever , there is no moral justification for planting bombs to make a point .
sir , permit me to link up with the debate that was conducted last week in the national assembly , before i make a practical proposal to the hon minister of community safety .
i have read newspaper articles , editorials and letters in recent weeks condemning the government 's naming of pagad as the main , if not only , suspects in the fight against urban terror .
i also want to commend the initiative by private business people to put up a reward of r2 million for the arrest and successful prosecution of persons involved in the urban terror .
it is a test of our ability to guarantee the safety of our people and impose the law , but it is also a test of our political maturity .
it would , however , be extremely difficult to prove discrimination against individuals , because our constitution defines individual freedoms so widely that it could very well by implication recognise the right to non-association .
mr speaker , the adjustments estimate is tabled today to seek the approval of this parliament in terms of the public finance management act , 1999 of certain adjustments to the 2000-01 budget .
section 31 of the public finance management act provides for the provincial minister responsible for financial matters to table an adjustments budget in the provincial parliament .
it is western cape agriculture which sat around a table with farm workers and their employers to ensure that the process of transformation was successfully embodied in the code of conduct ...
mr speaker , it is very clear that the speakers of the da wrote their speeches very early this morning because they do not understand the issue before the house .
i want to ask the hon leader of the opposition whether there was political interference which led to that farmer being charged and spending a night in the police cells .
sir , i want to ask the hon leader of the opposition whether this farmer has a claim against a political leader who caused him to spend the night in jail although innocent .
mr speaker , on a point of order : i would like to know whether it is in order that the opposition are out-debated in every session of this house .

evidence indicated that the expenditure had been met from the premier 's vote after the department of works , due to a shortage of funds , had refused to undertake the expenditure .
i propose that all chairpersons receive thorough training before they are allowed to take the chair for committee stages , or else wrong decisions could result in the house becoming a circus .
mr speaker , what they actually did was embarrass the public service corps and the treasury , who had to turn down their request and explain that it was unauthorised expenditure .
in fact , on the very same day dr ncholo wrote to this province and made it very clear in his letter that public servants would not receive monetary compensation .
the purpose is to be able to listen , to derive additional information and then to apply one 's mind to whether one is going to vote on the issue one way or another .
recently , at mandela high school , which is in the constituency of the hon minister of education , as she claimed yesterday , a teacher , mr mtshemla , was stabbed by a student .
[ one does not just go to the graveyard , to the people sleeping eternally , without consulting their families first , just because one wants to make a political gain .
before i start speaking i would like to announce that the hon premier has asked me to mention to the house that he apologises for not being present .
mr speaker , in under a month i will be presenting the provincial budget for the forthcoming financial year , so i will not attempt to dwell on matters concerning finance this afternoon .
it is a top-down virus in that organisation and if it is left to run its course it could kill the democracy that we have so dearly cherished .
mr speaker , because of the election results in the other provinces , they have taken their troops out of the rest of south africa and brought them here to take their last stand .
this year we will once again fund the orchestra , ballet and opera but so , too , will we fund the north sea jazz festival in our commitment to having something for everyone .
i have made the offer previously in this house that i am open to any hon member participating and playing a role in the work of my ministry and department .
mr speaker , i went with my colleague the hon leader of the opposition to the home of the young girl , karen adriaanse , who was shot on the first day of school .
] the hon member mr n m isaacs said earlier that my department had allocated r1,39 million to sports communities and local authorities in order to establish sports facilities chiefly in disadvantaged areas .
it goes without saying that the endeavours of this government are limited to the western and northern segments of the metropole , which the hon leader of the opposition has so rightly pointed out .
mr speaker , the nine objectives are the measurement criteria by which the government and cabinet have to be measured to see whether they are fulfilling their duties according to the nine objectives .
the hon minister of education is wasting the children 's time by not seeing to it that principals do their work and school governing bodies operate as they should .
they did excellent work over a period of one year and laid a good foundation for the unicity that was established and for the activities that are going on there .
if she were honest with the people of the cape metropolitan area , and about the promises that she made , she would be serving in the unicity together with mowzer and mfeketo .
the western cape government is delivering more houses than the national government is prepared to pay for , and sits waiting for funds that lie dormant in the account of the national government .
mr speaker , i am glad that not one of the new np leaders criticised the president because he referred to a racist incident in his opening address to parliament .
mr speaker , it is a great privilege for me to take part in the first debate of the century and to respond to the opening address of the hon premier .
i would like to be honest and i would like to put it on record that the acdp believes that the coalition government and the majority of ministers in their respective portfolios are doing a credible job .
they understood it on 2 june 1999 , and i am sure - the signs suggest this and experience proves it - that they will also understand it on 1 november 2000 .
mr speaker , the results of an opinion poll conducted by the human sciences research council during 1999 provided a crystal clear verdict on the quality of life and governance in the western cape .
mr speaker , first of all i want to add my thanks to the hon premier and congratulate him on his opening address of the second session of the second parliament of the western cape province .
i trust that we shall soon enjoy the fruits of various summits that he initiated in the past six months and that chrysalis will bear the fruits of his noble intentions .
it is a joke for an hon member to refer to " multi-party democracy " when those hon members have excluded the majority and decided to go the pre-1994 way .
] whilst other provinces , such as the northern province and the eastern cape , had to merge with their apartheid homelands , the western cape was not affected by that because it was already used as a white homeland .
it is time that there was a commitment to lift this portfolio from being a cinderella portfolio to one of rank and importance , receiving a commensurate proportion of the budget .
] i will go so far as to say that i will welcome them if they come to me with their grievances and give them my serious attention .
the point of order concerns the fact that all hon members must see to it that we maintain the dignity of the house at all times and that we remain involved in the debate .
on saturday morning at one of the biggest hotels in the city , a white afrikaner got out of the tourist bus that he was driving and said , " i will f ...
that is the trend and that is the attitude that is portrayed by the coalition government in the province - if one is black one has no future in the province .
mr speaker , the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism stood up here yesterday and said the anc had been working out who would be in their cabinet .
we are not supposed to be subjected to urban terrorism , gangsters ravaging our schools , drug peddling and car hijacking if the government is committed to dealing with crime .
success would be the development of a new ethos of policing ; one grounded in sophisticated intelligence and competent detection ; one that requires police who have the trust of the community .
the call by president mbeki in his speeches on 8 january and 4 february this year for us to resolve the problem of the colour line is one which needs to be responded to by all political parties .
we need to ask these two gentlemen the following questions : can they imagine what an inclusive provincial government could actually achieve in the province by uniting coloured , african and white ?
this should not be an exclusive occasion . let us work together in future so that we can reduce the slaughter on our roads for the sake of the people who use our roads .
no. if the hon minister of education felt like that , she would not think twice about putting a muslim child in herzlia high school , which is predominantly jewish .
for a long time it has been the tradition of the new np to make sure that when they need a person they will use him / her at a particular time .
interestingly , most of the stores overexpenditure of r16 million is located in the community health services organisation which is responsible for running clinics and community health centres throughout the metropole .
if criminals can steal from the offices of our national parliament , how can we feel safe anywhere , whether in our homes , in the streets or at our places of work ?
we must get away from that feeling of powerlessness and get on top of the problem through the power of the state and our communities , and by harnessing our communities and democracy to crush crime .
people quite rightly hoped for houses and a humane society which would be able to care for them properly and provide services in the areas of health , education and welfare services .
i have just returned from the united states of america and europe and i am saddened to report to the house that i have never encountered such a negative ...
my appeal is that we get all the required role-players together and determine how we can get homes for our farm workers to enjoy in their retirement as well , of which they too can enjoy the benefits .
we came to an agreement to give the hon member mr fransman two minutes extra because a mistake had been made while the speakers ' list was being changed .
earlier on , when the guguletu communities marched and marched to the point at which commissioner ganief daniels intervened , he was overruled - by whom ?
the cabinet colleague of this hon minister , the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism , in the very same article that has been quoted here , says , " what is this hullabaloo about powers of police ?
let me go on to say that the very members of the new np who are blackening the party must now be saying , " this is a wake-up call for us .
in addition to other delivery and operational objectives generated within departments , the cabinet further formulated priority projects and key deliverables which were enunciated in ministers ' policy speeches in this parliament in mid-september last year .
the central thrust of this budget , therefore , is ameliorating the skewed income distribution , relative and absolute poverty and thus uplifting the poor and marginalised of this province .
in essence , the changes in the amounts available for expenditure are year-on-year increases of r744,118 million for the 2000-01 financial year , r431,094 million for the 2002-03 financial year and r317,827 million for the 2001-02 financial year , a declining trend .
mr speaker , i must at this point say a few words about the exploitation of our own-revenue sources , since less than 5 % of this budget is derived from own revenue .
this national tax has now further eroded the possibility of the allowed list being meaningful , and serves only to pay lip service to the provisions of section 228 of the constitution .
the committee expresses its concern that there is no business plan for poverty relief and recommends that no funds be rolled over to poverty relief until an approved business plan is submitted .
for the other side of the house to now complain that people from the eastern cape are coming to cape town because they need better health care and better education is the height of cynicism .
the hon minister came before the committee - and she sat where the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation is sitting today - and lost her temper with the committee .
firstly , as the leaflet of the hon minister of finance and development planning points out , the medium term expenditure framework ( mtef ) is intended to bring policies and objectives together in a three-year expenditure envelope .
mr speaker , i will be moving a motion tomorrow calling for the house to support the acdp in requesting the appointment of a commission of inquiry to investigate this levy .
however , one cannot say that because entrants are black and have never had a history of fishing , they have no right to enter the fishing industry .
when we debate the social services budget , for example , it would be interesting to know what the percentages in a racial breakdown of residents in old-age or frail care homes would be .
mr speaker , regarding the hon member mr louis and his talk about 4,6 % of own revenue , i indicated in my speech that 4,6 % is far too low .
what i want to say to him in reply is that unfortunately - i know i repeat myself about this - the cake , other than 4,6 % , is baked by the national minister of finance .
the one is to get up here , put the vote and sit down , and the other is to react to certain remarks made here today .
however , one needs a firm point of departure and i believe that the introduction of the new-look vote 1 , the premier 's vote , is a good place to start .
they are already busy with an awareness campaign for national women 's day on 9 august 2000 , the national youth day on 16 june 2000 and international day for the disabled on 3 december 2000 .
i am of the opinion that he and his right-hand-man , dr j c stegmann of finance , deserve high praise for the way in which they are maintaining sound financial business practices in the pawc .
in this process the branch : corporate services supports provincial departments in the following two ways : firstly , strategic guidance and the development of common policy frameworks and , secondly , the delivery of specialised support services .
in november 1999 prof knight visited this country and his services were immediately procured for a three-day legislative drafting workshop at our cape administrative academy , situated on the farm kromme rhee .
the main function of the organisation and work study component is to provide advice to the director-general and the heads of departments on methods and techniques of promoting efficiency in the pawc .
we would like to see an enhancement of fiscal and financial control and improved service delivery by client departments , as well as the evaluation and improvement of the effectiveness of risk management , internal control and internal audit .
their vehicle to economic freedom has not even made an appearance on the horizon , causing the gap between haves and have-nots to widen constantly .
one thing is very certain , and that is that most of the hon members on that side of the house reiterated what i had said in my budget speech here this afternoon .
if hon members will just think back , i said last time that i , as the premier of this province , was going to spend money on communication for people to get their identity documents .
since 1 november 1999 , parliament has also been paying the executive 's salaries , and that is why the amount of r16,137 million has been budgeted additionally as a direct charge for salaries for all of us .
madam , i have already said that circumstances often lead to practices that grow on perceptions and later become the basis of myths with origins that are difficult to trace , and are then taken for granted .
i think the more pertinent question is whether this limitation has been imposed to rein in committee chairpersons of the ruling coalition whom the party bosses might regard as being overzealous .
we had the interjection of the hon minister of finance and development planning , which i want to place on record again , that next year there will be a 100 % funding of our needs !
i feel that if we can establish the principle that secretarial assistance is supplied to chairpersons via their party caucuses , the pressure on the coordinators of the different committees will be lifted .
therefore a balance should be found in which the executive can execute its programmes and there are some safety nets built in so that parliament , on the other hand , also has a say in it .
i think the hon minister is really being very disingenuous on this matter , because his office has written to someone who complained about this meeting to say that , and i quote :
i know the anc sometimes wear three hats - the sacp , cosatu and the anc hats - but i went there with two hats and it was in the interests of transparency .
mr speaker , this was an attempt to win party / political cookie points in knysna , and the hon minister is dragging civil servants in the province into his own politics .
it is very strange that the legal opinion sought by the provincial government very clearly stated that they did not have the right to do what they want to do .
money was also made available , and a cheque to the amount of r5 696,07 was paid to the wellington municipality , which is administering it , to cover those immediate expenditures for emergency assistance .
nevertheless , at the request of the department , the cmc has done a complete audit of all vacant and under-utilised land within the cape metropolitan area which is generally suitable for housing .
given that much of the water used was not piped water , and nobody kept a record of the volumes used , it cannot be measured .
whether it was dealt with through my office or the office of the hon premier , there were issues that had to be considered which i discussed with the hon premier and my office .
i do not believe in the presentation that it took time for the hon premier to apply his mind and his office had to apply their minds on this issue .
( a ) the procedure outlined in section 4 of the western cape provincial tender board law ( law 8 of 1994 ) was followed to select the new members of the board .
in terms of the functional areas set out in the cultural affairs act , 1989 ( act 65 of 1989 ) , the department assisted local communities in projects , including projects spanning human ecology .
whether a meeting on 28 march 2000 , attended by only seven persons , including himself , and abandoned due to lack of interest , was an official or party-political meeting ?
the heading does say " without notice " and the whole idea is that no notice is given to the hon premier of the question or questions asked .
( 3 ) there was no process of consultation with the provincial parliament concerning the appointment of security guards , as there is no known policy in the saps which requires this .
mr speaker , with all due respect , that does not emanate from the question asked and has nothing to do with my functions as a minister in this house .
mr speaker , in the light of the fact that the hon premier is going to put security officers on the buses , are they fully equipped to guarantee the safety of the commuters ?
secondly , there is the active participation by the provincial department of transport in the second phase of the special legalisation process being undertaken by the national department of transport .
thirdly , there is the dissemination of accurate information on law enforcement and regulatory issues to all stakeholders concerned in an environment where there is a great deal of confusion .
i can inform the house that daily 75 000 commuters move out of khayelitsha to the rest of the metropole , 58 000 by train , 9 000 by bus and 8 000 by taxi .
mr speaker , let me say that if truth be told , there was an impression and an understanding that over a number of months this matter could be resolved through negotiation .
in fact , i have just come back from an extensive trip in the oudtshoorn area to identify and examine some of the complaints that i have had from parents and from teachers alike .
there is a micro-management of the administration of local government , and therefore there are certain elements that are unconstitutional because it will prohibit local government from passing by-laws .
in response to the first part of the question by the hon member mr ozinsky yes , we are looking at an environmental management plan which will be finalised in the second week of september 2000 .
i would also like to tell the hon member ms essop that the members of the task team are messrs roman , du plooy , margolius and mbembe , ms govan and messrs slabbert , snyman and stander .
mr speaker , the hon member mr ramatlakane referred to a complaint submitted to the national department of transport by members of the public and by other people .
i further indicated that a consultant would be appointed to review the procurement process and to submit a plan to cabinet for discussion within five months of the said date .
the staff shortage during this particular period was unfortunately caused by one death , maternity leave for staff members and general illness , which in turn hampered the ordering of stock and maintenance of the requisite drug supply .
( 1 ) how was the r25 million expansion budget spent for the dial-a-ride pilot project for accessible public transport for physically disabled persons , which was approved by the cmc and introduced in 1997 ;
- or cohorts - with their march who actually excited people and brought emotions to the fore , and what happened on saturday at green point stadium spilled over at mcdonald ' s .
mr speaker , i am surprised that the hon leader of the opposition has premised his question by saying that he will give me a chance to shine .
we believe that one has to restore people 's pride and in order to restore their pride , one must be able to give them a hand-up and not a hand-out .
and i can also only assume that the contract must have been given to the facilitators or trainers - whatever they are called - in the period when he was here .
i also wish to convey my sincere thanks to the choir , the children , the band , the community patrol officers ( cpos ) , the traffic police , the tourism representatives and the members of my staff who were responsible for all the organisation .
mr speaker , regarding vote 6 - health , we would like to remind the hon minister of health that scof requested a full report on the health information system tender .
we have heard a number of explanations as to how this money came to be necessary , and of the billing systems that necessitated an amount of money like r37 million being spent on sita at this point .
one should also look at roll-overs as a percentage of the entire budget and i would point out that it is 1,52 % of the entire budget for the 1999-2000 financial year .
in addition to the unconditional funding of r175,99 million described above , further conditional allocations of moneys were granted by national departments in november 2000 in terms of the division of revenue act , 2000 .
the budget mentioned was the housing budget and the implication is very clear that the money allocated to housing went into the hon minister of housing 's pocket .
ask the rev allan hendrickse about brutus , who sat as close to him as he is sitting next to the hon leader of the opposition , before he knifed him in the back .
i must point out that in my letter i clearly stated that the speaker cannot take matters into his own hands where the rules already make certain provisions .
( 1 ) what interim measures are being taken by local government authorities to solve the problem of sewage spills that have affected the macassar community over the last year ; and
i would like us to monitor and watch what the cmc is going to do about this , because thus far they have not done what was acceptable to that community .
mr speaker , as the hon premier has pointed out , this is an issue that has lasted nearly nine years , because the original zoning approval was given on 18 june 1991 .
mr speaker , i want to ask the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism whether the flats are occupied only by white people , or do coloured and black people also live there ?
( 2 ) when will this policy be discussed by the relevant standing committee ; ( 3 ) whether there will be a role for public participation in the finalisation of this policy
mr speaker , have the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism and the department been in contact or in engagement with the national land restitution processes , or is this an entirely separate process ?
mr speaker , my second question relates to a letter which the department of the hon minister has written to grotto bay ltd , the grotto bay homeowners ' association and the west coast district council .
mr speaker , i did not understand the question , but i had lunch with the judge president at the opening of parliament when he swore us in last year .
mr speaker , i gave this house and the people out there an undertaking that we would take government to the people , because that is the expansion of democracy .
in accordance with the constitutionally enshrined principle of intergovernmental relations , the department has interacted with a variety of role-players at both national and provincial level in order to further its core functions and responsibilities .
due to these initiatives , the pressures were greatly reduced in the last financial year , and with the exception of health , the province should break close to even by march 2000 .
the format of the adjustments estimate has been reformed and the principle of budgeting for negative amounts - instead of the nominal r1 000 - has been adopted nationally at the initiative of this province .
invariably one can easily recognise an addict , be it an alcoholic or a drug addict and so on , but a compulsive problem gambler is only recognised by his or her loved ones .
in fact , i can tell hon members that the goal for staffing was 50 : 50 by the end of 1999 in relation to gender and the proportion of persons of colour to white persons .
sars may in future be able to handle that competency , and i believe that dealing with the matter should almost stand adjourned pending the progress made by sars .
perhaps we could give consideration to involving the universities , as suggested by my colleague the hon member mr louis , and including that type of situation as a further investigation .
in this regard , and following his inauguration in june 1999 , president mbeki in opening parliament devoted extensive time to the single biggest threat to a free south africa - crime .
to support the community patrol officers scheme financially and otherwise , as well as the " stop terror now " number which we have instituted which is a toll-free number with regard to urban terrorism .
madam chairperson , an important element of the department 's strategy in regard to community police forums ' administration , is to build capacity and properly administer the functioning of cpfs in the province .
no , it is too long in afrikaans - is still meeting monthly to receive feedback on crime-prevention projects that have been launched as well as providing guidance and leadership in respect of new projects .
we still have a very large percentage of violence taking place , and as long as our country is so infested with violence , we know for a fact that it will have an effect on investments .
even if a study has to be launched , this must be accorded immediate attention , so that we can get a stronger force on the ground in a hurry , capable of handling the crime .
madam chairperson , firstly , i want to thank the department and its officials , for the information of the hon member mr strachan , for their assistance in various committees over the past few weeks .
the budget has no jurisdiction over our criminal justice system , which remains , six years after the anc came to power , poorly equipped to deal with the prevention , detection and prosecution of crime .
this is clearly an issue of national competency , but in fact becomes an issue of national incompetency when one looks at the way the anc are looking after our safety .
in connection with the rising tide of rape , i would like to enquire from the hon minister whether any initiatives have been taken in this regard , particularly in transversal relationships with other departments , like that of education .
mr chairperson , allow me to sincerely thank all the members of the saps and all the officers for performing a task in this province which has demanded so much sacrifice .
in doing so the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation has clearly spelt out his agenda in regard to the many problems that stem from lack of transformation in its portfolio .
our arrangement with the cmc was that we only wanted their money as long as they understood that the majority of the cpos their money would pay for would go to the disadvantaged areas .
the criminal procedure act stipulates that a person who has been arrested is the responsibility of the police until such time as he is sentenced , whereafter he becomes the responsibility of correctional services .
i am sure his commendation of the coaches and umpires will not extend to the indian umpire who no-balled shaun pollock a short while ago .
with no funds being directed towards school sport from the education budget and the limited resources available in this budget , it is the youth of our province who will ultimately suffer .
i am , of course , speaking about the 35 000 cyclists from all over the globe who are already pouring into cape town for the biggest cycle race in the world , the argus cycle tour , although this year it is a cycle detour .
now that south africa is being visited to determine whether we are indeed able to present the world cup soccer tournament in 2006 , i realise that we in the western cape do not even have a good soccer field .
it was c h j taylor , an american people 's advocate who said , " we have no reason to complain until we take pride in our own country .
these six factors , which were endorsed not only by the provincial cabinet and by this house , but by the national minister of education , constitute our implementation framework for tirisano .
mr chairperson , the main objective of this measuring instrument is developmental , but we will also be using good performance across these benchmarks to determine the allocation of incentives and certain resources to schools .
during the months ahead we hope to appoint a full-time aids education coordinator funded by the national department , and i wish to thank them very much for this assistance .
without it our education would become irrelevant and the products of our schools would be ambling along dirt roads , while the rest of the world travels along electronic super highways and disappears over the cyber horizon out of our sight .
mr chairperson , the initial costs are astronomical , but once implemented khanya will probably still require an investment of between r150 million and r200 million per year .
it will also require the full participation of the whole western cape community , including all parent communities , all educators , the education department , the provincial government as a whole , a large number of ngos and the business sector .
permit me , too , to thank the members of the standing committee on education , environmental and cultural affairs for their wholehearted support for the sake of promotion of education in the western cape .
after the standing committee had met with the role-players of those institutions and the wced , a different process was followed during which there was real interaction with the communities of those institutions .
the national qualifications framework , school governing bodies , curriculum 2005 , teacher redeployment and teacher development appraisal systems are just some examples of the policies that have emerged in the new education system .
the principals cooperated with them and gave them the documents , but this has left a very bitter taste in the mouths of all the principals and many of the school circuit managers .
i am sure that through her efforts , and those of her department , each and everyone of us in this province will reap the rewards as we move forward into the knowledge-based 21st century .
we would like to support the hon minister in her thanks to public works regarding the upgrading of the schools , because there needs to be a good environment for children to operate in .
when the adjustments estimate was being dealt with i found it gratifying to note that the department of works was involved in projects to plant grass at some of the schools .
we believe that if this scenario was present in one of the former model c schools , the hon minister would not have hesitated in acting to change it .
from the moment she took office as minister , she has tirelessly and enthusiastically focused on her task of improving education in the western cape at all levels .
the moves towards equity in provision of resources have forced the wced to cut back on the number of teaching posts by several thousand over the past few years .
madam chairperson , as the hon minister of education has visited 103 schools , i would like to tell her that i am busy with the same project , but i am not just focusing on education .
at the start of my term i was quite unable to understand this , but my attention was drawn to the fact that we are indeed starting a process to change the whole thing .
one of the massive failures of that enormous and ambitious attempt at curriculum change was that it was completely underestimated what learner support materials will be required throughout the system to effect it .
the fact of the matter is that many schools that charge r20 per year - and often do not even get that all in - are often very good , orderly and functional schools .
it is hoped that this allocation will improve quality of care , help us to work smarter and assist in retaining professional specialist expertise in our hospitals .
i shall request the branch : health to consult with the department of works to consider alternatives in regard to the tender and procurement procedure where this will be visible and more cost-effective .
i shall shortly be calling for proposals from private developers to upgrade the reception area of the tygerberg hospital as a mini-shopping complex which may include enterprises such as restaurants , cafs , stationery shops , flower boutiques and so on .
accordingly we shall establish in the department a post of health ombudsman or woman - let us call it an ombudsman - to deal effectively with the complaints function together with our medical law section .
we in the public sector will not meet the objectives which i have described , unless we join hands in cooperative ventures with the private sector , which has much-needed expertise and resources to offer .
[ mr p m jacobs : madam chairperson , let me start by adding my voice to those who have congratulated dr sutcliffe and his team on the good work that they are continuing to perform .
let us take a trauma victim presenting with a head injury of such a nature that he or she is discharged from hospital two or three days later without needing neurosurgery .
madam chairperson , i am sorry , i really feel that the hon minister has not understood the intention of a budget debate , because in such a debate plans are put on the table .
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 16 - sport and recreation of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1999 [ pr 18 / 2000 ] .
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 19 - improvement of conditions of service of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1999 [ pr 10 / 2000 ] .
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 11 - environmental and cultural affairs of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1999 [ pr 19 / 2000 ] .
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 17 - department of transport of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1999 [ pr 37 / 2000 ] .
when we refer to mitchells plain , it is not only mitchells plain , but the magisterial district which includes places such as nyanga , old crossroads , guguletu , khayelitsha , brown 's farm and mitchells plain itself .
there 61,5 % of the 5 905 households have an income of r1 500 per month and less , a serious concern to the house and everyone in the province .
the importance of these multipurpose-centres is really that they will identify the needs of the community , so one will not have one multipurpose-centre that is exactly the same as the other .
the next matter i would like to refer to is the re-registration project by means of which the database for social grant systems is being updated and the correct and accurate data for the 320 000 beneficiaries in the western cape .
it deserves mention that approximately 46 % of the above allocation was paid to projects in the north west of the province , the karoo , the little karoo and the mitchells plain and wynberg magisterial districts .
enough negative and destructive criticism has recently been identified by hon members on the other side of the house and as i have already said , their " poofters " and appeasers and fellow-travellers .
we should rather think of ways that will actually generate income for women who have been receiving grants and try to find and establish a long-term process for women to have access to money .
the number of multi purpose centres , especially those in the 100 poorest communities in the province , should have work incentive programmes and not just service clubs where people come together twice a week to meet socially .
there are so many enquiries going through our offices regarding the plight of the children , and there are so many different ngos to contact , but there is no central communication point .
in my opinion an effort must be made to have a positive impact on the government structures so that that money can be channelled to the provinces , particularly where the endemic incidence of aids is very high .
madam chairperson , i would like to say to the hon member mr winde that i take cognisance of the fact that time is of the essence regarding the appointment of a consultant .
i want to link up with something you said yesterday during the debate on vote 7 - social services , namely that you were participating in a debate on the social services budget for the sixth time .
however , i am pleased to announce that the national minister of housing has just advised me that the reduced budget allocation will be phased in over a period of three years .
apart from the provision of housing , our greatest challenge will be to ensure that those housing opportunities already provided up to now remain at the disposal of the beneficiaries for whom they were intended .
the guidelines entitle them to access a second subsidy should they be deprived of the right to occupy the land in respect of which the subsidy has been paid out .
approximately 25 % of these plots will go to people who do not qualify for a subsidy , and the balance will be aimed at families earning more than r2 500 per month .
the hon minister said that this was the last time that he would make a speech about the people who live in the residential units , because he has been making speeches about them for five years now .
the hon minister of housing failed to implement the 3h housing campaign , which was introduced by the former national minister of housing , the late joe slovo , to address hunger , housing and health .
the predominant problem with housing development is that over the years the authorities did not plan for development , because urbanisation was not part of the then government 's policy framework for housing .
when his colleague the hon member mr mckenzie was still minister of local government , he was sitting there when i begged for this legislation in the caucus , because the time period would have elapsed .
equally important is the role of project viability with regard to the smaller municipalities , where the focus will be on updating books and records and compiling financial statements and cash flow budgets .
we are in the midst of transforming local government into a new dispensation , as expected by the newly demarcated municipalities , so that they can be fully functional by the time of the coming elections .
all we are asking is that those hon members of the anc just use their influence to tell their colleagues in the other place that they are suffering from a dangerous brake syndrome .
madam chairperson , by the number of times you nodded your head i saw that you truly appreciated the hon member mr n m isaacs 's speech .
why can we not have a coordinated fund to which this province , every local authority and the private sector contribute and we manage it jointly , in case another disaster strikes this province ?
] if i had had voter education in this budget - and in many cases one does not need money to do voter training - the question would just have been turned the other way round .
the first of these requirements has taken longer than was originally anticipated , owing to the very thorough process of consultation and public participation which has accompanied the finalisation of the regulations .
in the light of recent legislative and policy developments in both national and provincial spheres , it will be necessary to revisit the role and function of the provincial government in the idp process .
this was done bearing in mind the need to maintain the integrity of the agricultural resource , which forms the basis of employment for more than 200 000 people in this province .
firstly , we must point out , for the record , that the original decision to overturn the decision taken by the south peninsula municipality was a decision of the full cabinet .
madam chairperson , when one knows that another hon minister still has to come after one , one would like to summarise the debate in a sentence , half a paragraph or only a couple of paragraphs .
if there is any hon minister from this government or any former cabinet member who has a financial interest , or any other interest for that matter , in valkenberg , he should please tell us .
when i first took over this portfolio , i said in the house that i accepted that the hon member mr louis did the right thing with regard to dassenberg .
i want to tell the hon member mr isaacs that i was the chairperson of the planning committee - or the urban planning committee as it was called in cape town - for some years .
if the provincial development council has to go anywhere - a decision to which i will apply my mind and on which i do not have preconceived ideas - i will see to it that it goes as a unit .
more than 1 087 projects were approved , of which 112 were youth projects and 253 were youth-related ; and more than 1 400 funding applications were received , requesting more than r70 million in subsidies .
what it is going to do is create a situation similar to the one that exists in the planning department , where the very people who are submitting applications on behalf of developers are the ones who are going to check up on those applications .
we also commend the department on the existence of the western cape nature conservation board , to come into effect on 1 april , with the critical function of unlocking ecotourism in the province .
mr speaker , furthermore , the department is also requested by the committee to scrutinise all legislation it administers with a view to amending possible outdated and unconstitutional provisions .
in terms of the amendments today , i accept the amendments proposed by the standing committee on education , environmental and cultural affairs and request that the house proceed with the third reading .
i want them to remember that the elderly people who owe between r10 000 and r11 000 , who were told in the 1994 election not to pay , have to pay it today .
hon members should bear in mind that over the past 20 to 30 years those people have paid off that land and the houses they are living in over and over again by way of rentals paid to the councils .
as hon members are aware , the new public finance management act commences on 1 april this year and will prevail over any legislation which is not consistent with it .
madam chairperson , it is a great privilege to thank the hon premier for the confidence he has reposed in me by entrusting this portfolio to me .
every effort is , however , being made to increase our revenue base , principally through significant increases in the vehicle licence fees , and mention has already been made of the additional revenue being generated through personalised number plates .
the time for comment on the policy expires at the end of april and it has been reported that the draft regulations are still not completed and we still need to go to cabinet .
they do have a transformation policy in place , but we would like to see it being implemented in the year 2000 and 2001 so that a positive comment can be made in that regard .
i appeal to the hon minister that people should at least be warned when something of the kind is going to be done because , whether my clearance certificate is at the top of the windscreen or at the bottom in the corner ...
the south african poverty and inequality report states that 61 % of africans , 38,2 % of coloureds , 5,4 % of indians and 1 % of whites are poor .
] i think my colleague the hon member mr silke is not here because he is picking out his new plate , which i think is going to be bean 1 .
a good friend of mine has just told me that the northern cape , which did not increase its licence fees , very probably forgot to increase them .
( 3 ) believes that this allegation is intended to discredit the much-needed transformation of local government administrations and the application of the employment equity act ;
on 9 december 1999 we hosted a tourism conference at which we reported back on comments received from stakeholders , and members of this house were also present at that conference .
from the white book and the committee hearings , hon members would have noticed that we have budgeted for an amount of r1,9 million to be spent by the provincial government on performing these functions .
they are of course not entirely wrong , since between 30 % and 60 % of acute admissions to our public hospitals in the western cape , are there directly or indirectly as a result of alcohol abuse .
currently unemployment is a major problem in these communities but they do have tourism potential and they will be focused on with a view to getting new projects off the ground or improving existing projects .
in today 's world the continued success of any organisation or business depends on how well it invests in information and communication technologies , and how information and knowledge is captured and deployed .
these niches will be extensively researched through a detailed pipeline study to identify strengths and market potential , and the sectors networked to apply the findings of the research .
in the light of the problems that we experience with ntsika , i cannot see how lbscs will survive other than as a partnership between local authorities , provincial government and the private sector .
if a small operator 's application for a liquor licence is refused because of community objections - whether they are justified or not - his only recourse is to approach the high court of south africa .
the chief directorate is in the process of formulating models for outsourcing the management of a number of properties , such as vaaldraai at elsenburg , kromme rhee , nelspoort and the de nova complex adjacent to kraaifontein .
for this i have to thank a superb staff complement consisting of amongst others , our superintendent-general , mr carl du preez ; our ddg , ms loreen platzky ; our chief director , mr james slabbert ; and their directors .
there is only one critical question we need to ask in this portfolio , and that is : where is the future of this province , and what is government 's responsibility ?
we need to move away from the notion that this province is an economic island ; it needs to be given expression by the involvement of national government beyond the khula initiative which has been referred to .
from the presentation in the gold book under the heading " outlook for the year 2000-01 " the hon minister and his department seem to have their work cut out for them in this financial year .
from the look of things the standing committee on economic affairs , under the chairpersonship of the hon member mr louis , will also have its work cut out with legislation and policies coming to fruition .
it is said , " if we allow them in , our meetings will no longer start on time and they will want to hold meetings when we want to go and relax at the sea during the school vacations .
] in other words , the western cape government was being attacked for not being racially inclusive , whilst the anc in the rest of the country was not prepared to honour that principle .
madam chairperson , in the western cape agriculture provides a livelihood to thousands of people in rural areas , and can be classed as one of the most advanced regions in this regard in africa .
the relative inclinations of the average demand and supply functions lead to a situation in which a small change in the quantity of agricultural products will lead to a high proportional change in the prices of agricultural products .
agriculture is endeavouring to find and implement a set of solutions to this challenge in the most cost-effective way possible and to the best advantage of all the people of the province .
when we look at the target group of the budget and of the five-year plan presented in september 1999 , it is evident that the upliftment of emerging farmers only extends to the old coloured reserve areas .
madam chairperson , the aim of the hon minister is to make a real success of the establishment of new farmers , and to improve the position of the farm workers as a whole .
however , the impact of various labour laws on agriculture has serious implications and in all cases this means that in due course job opportunities will be scaled down for various reasons merely in order to survive .
in one case i found it strange that when the wife returned from maternity leave she was paid only r70 per week whereas before her maternity leave she had earned r100 per week .
madam chairperson , i believe that the national government must reach out to agriculture and recognise the important role played by agriculture , and create an environment for us within which we can create employment .
does the rule regarding heckling from a seat other than the member 's own apply in the committee of the whole house as it does in the house ?
as i understand it , if one has no objection in principle to the vote , but one has an objection to a programme in that vote , one 's objection to that programme is noted .
we would like to propose that that money be allocated to existing poverty relief programmes in a number of other departments and not retained under the control of the minister without portfolio .
condemns the existence of such practices and calls on the dp and the new np to commit themselves to policies which promote support for smmes , particularly in african and coloured communities .
it was c h j taylor , an american people 's advocate who said , " we have no reason to complain until we take pride in our own country .
in the same breath i also want to thank the chairperson of the standing committee on economic development , the hon member mr louis , for the way he dealt with the bill .
firstly , there is the auditing of licences - there will be registration and all associations will be reassessed when they get their new licenses - and there is also the recapitalisation process .
in closing , mr speaker , i would like to say that i believe our greatest task as legislators is to be protectors of the people , and this bill sends out that signal .
we believe that public transport consultative forum should be regulated without delay in order that integrated public transport with a feeder system and fare structure can receive urgent attention from key stakeholders - the commuters , operators and government .
the closing of taxi ranks is obviously going to increase tension in the trouble spots which have already divided communities , some of which support the taxi industry and others the golden arrow bus services .
he could then have gone to his office and made regulations , and if he had wanted to , he could have afforded us the common courtesy of allowing us to have a look at them .
it is a pity that the police department are not present here today to listen to all the possible measures mentioned here to restore peace and stability on the cape flats .
i should like the hon member mr byneveldt , once we have debated this motion , to take this further so that we can work on it and get something on the statute book in this regard .
it might be against that hon member 's party policies , but let us leave that ; it is in the bible - an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth .
i hope that all those hon members will attend the national assembly to hear what the national minister has to say about crime and how he is going to combat it countrywide .
i should like to report to the house that the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling yesterday agreed to this bill but that the anc opposed it and will state their standpoints today .
the facts are that yesterday in the standing committee meeting , two hours after the hon premier 's grand speech , our committee was faced with a bill to authorise unauthorised expenditure .
however , the real issue is whether the province has met its rightful constitutional obligations by providing assistance to the voter registration campaign when called upon by national government to do so .
in september , as my colleague said , the hon premier explained to his new np constituency that the problem was simply one of bar-coded ids - he had to fight for his own life .
a volunteer is someone who undertakes to offer voluntarily , and it defines " voluntarily " as " done , given or acting of one 's own free will , working or done without payment " .
mr speaker , yesterday dr barnard tried to give the impression that this was forced on him because of the lack of time that he had to mobilise the volunteers .
madam chairperson , can that question , together with all the details , and all other questions to me under vote 1 be converted to questions in writing and i will give a written reply .
the point is , i cannot take evidence from the hon member that this has happened and from some other hon member to the effect that it has not happened .
if the hon leader of the opposition wants to know exactly where the r18 000 came from in a budget of r2 billion , he will have to give me the opportunity to find it .
madam chairperson , would the hon minister of finance and development planning indicate to the house from which programme and subprogramme in this current financial year he has managed to save r23 159,06 ?
earlier on the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs indicated that he was not around in the 1998-99 financial year and that he would obviously need money and always needed money .
madam chairperson , again the hon leader of the opposition is asking me for an opinion on something that i had nothing to do with originally , but yes , i would agree with that .
] as far as the r35 000 is concerned , i believe that 35 people were employed at r1 000 each and that is how the r35 000 was arrived at .
madam chairperson , my question to the hon minister of education is : from which programme - it was not answered - and / or subprogramme was the amount of r1,6 million saved ?
there is a rule that we cannot proceed with more than one reading or stage of a bill on the same day , unless the whips have an agreement that it should be done .
hon members will appreciate that if i do that , the hon member ms essop will in any case have the opportunity to decide that she opposes proceeding with the third reading .
he cannot say that the western cape is the best when he claims achievements , and all the intractable problems are placed within what he calls a national backdrop .
yesterday , therefore , the hon premier spoke as the unquestioned leader of a party that has demonstrated that there is no doubt that it is the biggest political party in this province .
it is certainly on record that in this province the chances of having an application for assistance processed within a reasonable time is much better than in any other province in south africa .
however , i must say that to some extent the appointment of the current minister of community safety has contributed towards ending what i call " the mark wiley syndrome " .
four prominent businessmen were arrested after the police area commissioner of the southern cape started with a clamp down on organised crime and syndicates operating in the area .
the hon minister of social services and poverty relief said that he really wanted to start a process to empower communities and the women who were coming off the state maintenance grants .
the nnp and the dp , and many people in the cape who are able to telephone in to radios and so on , believe that the only thing we should do in that area is to police it .
i admire the hon member ms brown for the daring she displayed in accepting at short notice the anc candidacy for mayor of the unicity .
mr chairperson , as far as the development of the rural areas is concerned , i call to mind specifically the farm workers and the large percentage of inhabitants of the towns who are really dependent solely on seasonal work .
on 12 and 13 august 2000 the south african national aids council convened a meeting to discuss the research findings and training sites for the mtct ( mother-to-child transmission ) programme and to look at scientific and operational issues .
the fight against hiv / aids is linked to the provision of basic services , health , housing , clean water , sanitation , improved nutrition and food security , and a fight against diseases such as tb , stds and malnutrition .
mr speaker , the hon premier and the hon minister of health have issued conflicting statements on this issue ; what the hon premier said differs from what the hon minister said .
in order for us to address the major issues of unemployment and poverty , we need to have a sustainable economic growth in the order of at least 4 % to 5 % per annum .
mr speaker , the hon premier announced that this government would focus on rural development and that a team of experts had been appointed to draw up a comprehensive policy for rural development .
] soon after that , these big companies sensed that there is now a new paradigm afoot , and they tried to conform to that paradigm by giving work to black empowerment groups .
as the hon premier said yesterday in his opening address , it is the western cape that has given the lead in the prevention of mother-baby hiv infection .
year after year - and every time at this time of the year , at about christmas - the position of the hon leader of the opposition is questioned and everything comes out in the media .
what spin doctor , or leader , allows a party like the anc to put up a candidate for mayor , lets her canvass votes and then causes her to disappear before the posters have been removed from the poles ?
we will be joining countries like senegal and rwanda , because it will enable us to get certain antiretroviral drugs for less than the price of some generic drugs in india .
by tracking the fault lines of society , the aids pandemic has tightened its grip on the poorer sections of society and left them even poorer and more vulnerable .
mr speaker , what was very noticeable in all the votes was the fact that money was allocated to conditions of service in all departments , as they were being streamlined or perhaps being adjusted .
i want to remind the house what the then minister said on 14 march 2000 when we were debating the budget , and i quote from hansard : western cape , vol 3 , p 1254 :
that is why i have attempted to put it into perspective in regard to the total amount of r135 million and the cabinet having laid down how the money should be spent .
i said " for instance " when shacks burn down , or we find that in particular circumstances in the province people are in desperate circumstances , serious consideration will be given to this .
there are also certain key measurable objectives which the department would want to see and they would want to make sure that the end beneficiaries are able to sustain the project over a longer period of time .
madam chairperson , i would like to know , with regard to the olympic money that is left over , whether any proposals have been made at this stage by the departments for the use of that money .
i must add the condolences of the acdp to those expressed by the hon member mr isaacs regarding the loss of lives , and the family that has been affected , as was mentioned in this debate .
because of the crisis the traffic jams are worse than they have ever been before , and even if they board the bus at 07 : 30 they are still late for school in town .
the hon minister of education painted a glossy picture here by saying that she had spoken to so and so , done this and that , and been on a bus .
] i think that that question needs to be asked , in the same way that we have asked in the past in what way this provincial government could gain anything by urban terrorism .
mr speaker , we have also seen how golden arrow have effectively been ejected from places like khayelitsha and nyanga , and commuters have been denied freedom of choice regarding their mode of transport .
we in the anc have very sadly seen the beating up and hospitalisation of one of our leaders in the khayelitsha area , mr khaya magaga , while carrying out his work .
mr speaker , the issues which caused the deaths , the violence and the petrol bombing , and denied commuters their choice have come back to haunt us in may 2000 .
australia is the most popular destination for international meetings this year , and they should be our model rather than most of the american or european countries , because they are , like us , a long-haul destination .
this unique vehicle does not fall within the ambit of the public finance management act of 1999 ; nor it is a public / private partnership in the classical sense .
given the western cape 's strong financial and insurance sector and its base of major oil and petroleum companies , there is an important economic base that can be a target for any convention centre .
ministers or immediate dependant members of the family of ministers may not serve on the boards of public companies or own shares in companies directly connected with the minister 's official duties .
let me firstly say , with reference to the very handbook that the hon member quoted , that the hon minister of finance and development planning is not a director of any public company .
that is why i would go along with the new subsection ( 2 ) and i would think the hon member should find that sufficient and let the second amendment fall away .
in the amendments to the bill the original " shareholders agreement " on the third page of the bill , line 35 , had been changed to " convenco agreement " .
the committee has taken note of the circumstances which gave rise to the excess expenditure and recommends that the unauthorised expenditure of r33 531 178,12 be referred to the provincial parliament for authorisation .
the committee wishes to express its disappointment that complete and detailed information in respect of various matters in auditor-general reports could not be provided by certain departments during meetings .
if hon members look at the first schedule , they will see the category a municipalities and the menu provided for them , and this is also true for of the categories b and c municipalities .
once again there is a violation of the autonomy of local government and this negates the powers that the hon minister himself granted to local government and in this instance the district transformation forums .
the new np is of the opinion that such an executive mayor with executive powers can become the political lackey of a political party and can totally ignore the needs and desires of the community .
by excluding the possibility of the executive mayor and going for a collective executive system instead , this province will be able to better serve its citizens through democratic and accountable government .
just for interest 's sake , the awb members had a veritable arsenal of arms , including a missile , and they received suspended sentences , whilst the anc member was sentenced to jail for the possession of a side-arm .
however , i got the impression that in their wanting to make a positive contribution they were simply regaling poor justice verdicts , which is not bolstering the independence of the judiciary .
mr speaker , i again want to remind members of the new np that it was their party that packed the judiciary when they wanted to remove the coloured people from the voters ' roll .
we left the labour party - and my friends will remember that - because we decided that the labour party was no longer the vehicle to promote the upliftment of coloured people .
let me tell my coloured friends here that it is heartbreaking that in the present negotiations between the new np and the dp they have only two coloured people representing our interests .
] all the hon member mr mckenzie talked about was the interests of the coloured people , as if it were coloureds versus africans versus whites , and we do not see south africa in that context .
for those who try to see the bigger picture in politics , for example , the editor of the cape times said in an editorial on 14 june 2000 , and i quote : ...
if they believe that the dp " baklei harder teen die kaffers " than the anc , the new np and constand viljoen , they should go to tony leon , helen zille and hennie bester .
when a creditworthy small business has gone through all the checks , has an extremely viable business project and goes to a bank to apply for a business loan , surely that is good business .
a point of balance will have to be found between maintaining the independence of the banking sector and an active approach that will have to be pursued in financing the small , medium and micro businesses .
the setting up of the dp business desk has misled people into believing that the dp , as a political party outside of the provincial government , will address the problems of the black contractors .
mr speaker , i would like to say the following to those people who believe we are on the wrong track , especially where the spokespersons of those parties are people who were previously advantaged .
we would put that together with khula 's r20 million and we would go with khula to the private sector institutions to get the other r30 million to get it started .
the committee has taken note of the circumstances which gave rise to the excess expenditure and recommends that the unauthorised expenditure of r34 406,69 referred to the provincial parliament for authorisation .
my answer to the question by the hon member is , i wish he would learn to spell my name correctly and i wish he would stop being a racist .
there are critical differences between the anc on that side and the da on this side of the house in how they view local government and how they view the application of property rates .
] revenue must be used for the benefit of all people and not just to pay a vast army of public servants for services which could be provided better and cheaper by the private sector .
but most importantly , the bill prescribes that municipalities adopt the rates policy after consultation with communities and that the rates policy must treat persons liable for rates equitably .
is this not a clear shift of emphasis that we are getting now , that people should not pay for services , " but they will get funding via the rates from the specific municipality " ?
the rates in pinelands and clifton increased by 15 % this year , those in bishopscourt and camps bay by 13 % and those in newlands , upper claremont , vredehoek , oranjezicht and gardens by 11 % .
i therefore rule that in future all requests for a moment 's silence should be made to the presiding officer or the presiding officer will request a moment 's silence .
subsection ( 4 ) which is inserted after subsection ( 3 ) makes it clearer and provides as follows , even in cases when we do not appear in court , and i quote :
these illegal operators do not pay taxes , very seldom contribute anything good for the benefit of the community and provide a breeding ground for other criminal activities such as drug trafficking , prostitution and money-laundering .
what has become apparent is the fact that there is a distinct difference between the gambling employees working , for example , for a bookmaker operation or tote and those working in a casino .
the amendment will also drastically enhance the effectiveness of the board by releasing staff who have up to now spent most of their time licensing the said gambling employees .
at this point i , too , would like to pay special tribute to the recent actions of the board in closing a variety of illegal casinos operating in the sea point area .
sir , the chief whip was right earlier on when he said that you are not seen as the speaker of that side of house , but as the speaker of the entire house .
when we debate an issue in the house , it is not an anc debate or a debate of the hon premier ; it is a debate in which the entire house should participate .
the hon minister of local government and development planning also knows his name because the ratepayers ' society wrote a letter to him complaining about the corruption in that area .
mr speaker , on a point of order : i believe that the hon premier is misleading the house , because he has elected a committee to look at the ...
act in any way that is inconsistent with their office , or expose themselves to any situation involving the risk of a conflict between their official responsibilities and private interests ...
act in any way that is inconsistent with their office , or expose themselves to any situation involving the risk of a conflict between their official responsibilities and private interests ; ...
the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism can laugh about all of this , he can show all the bravado in the world , but we want him to be checked .
the point is , how can one create an impression that one has declared one 's interest in convenco and then when one is pushed , say that it was done with the hon premier ?
we also need to make it very clear here that the anc has never asked the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism to resign or be fired over this issue .
we want him to stay here because , for as long as he is there , we are able to pierce that moralistic self-righteousness that they are incorruptible and only blacks are corruptible .
what is more , tony gocini could have sent him a note and said , " this matter has already been discussed , " or words to that effect , " would you not raise it again ?
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 4 - housing and planning of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1999 [ pr 102 / 2000 ] .
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 3 - general administrative services of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1999 [ pr 104 / 2000 ] .
mr speaker , in the old south african context and as the previous government identified it , anyone who fought for his right to human dignity and equal rights was a terrorist .
what our province and our country want from us is a sense that the organs of state are mobilised , working and on the trail of these terrorists .
each one made an exceptional contribution today , particularly the hon member mr a j williams , who pointed out , inter alia , that we are dealing here with a test for our democracy .
we can sit in this house and pretend that the realities of black people do not exist , and when i talk about black people , i talk in the inclusive sense of africans , coloureds and indians .
] i would imagine they are simply relieved that someone is giving them access to the drugs they need to give their children a chance in life .
there is a common perception that the western cape administration is a kind of safe harbour for white public servants from all the other provinces at the expense of well qualified people of colour in the province .
sir , when i speak about " people of colour " my intention is not that of tokenism , of appointing people merely to have a black or a brown person there .
under the influence of president mbeki , the anc has within only 15 months of his office succeeded in setting back the cause of national reconciliation and nation-building to the pre-mandela era .
our gini coefficient is at 0,6 and that tells us that the gap between the richest amongst the wealthy and the poorest amongst the poor is one of the greatest in the world .
to be a south african that is not discriminated against on the basis of race is a cause i have always fought for and it is a cause i will continue to fight for .
the hon leader of the opposition was right when he said that we must admit that racism occurs , and we must work on ways of overcoming it .
that the house congratulates mr allister coetzee on his appointment as the first black coach of a provincial rugby team , as well as the eastern province rugby union for the courage to appoint him .
sir , the subject we are debating today is an issue that has to do with the lot of the farm people and how we can look after the interests of our people on the farms .
cognisance was also taken of the need to acknowledge and respect the independent status of local governments in terms of section 151 of the constitution of the republic of south africa , 1996 .
however , sir , there were rulings of the chair which in my opinion did not contribute towards order in the house and which you ought perhaps to bring to the attention of the deputy speaker .
we received a report from the director-general to the effect that he was not getting sufficient people who were prepared to come up and work for nothing - volunteers .
if we omit the r135 million with regard to the casino licence , this is indeed one of the smaller adjustments estimates yet introduced , which proves that we are on the right track .
hon members will recall that with regard to the r135 million casino licence fee , i indicated that the whole amount would be ploughed back into capital projects and specifically directed towards roads and works .
he spoke about a very good open-door policy , but we would like to encourage him to have not only an open door but an open mind as well regarding many issues .
if it is sincerely his desire to unite this province and fulfil the requirements of the constitution , we as the acdp would like to know why we were excluded from the unicity .
it is difficult for us to understand how we can talk , on the one hand , about cooperative government and working towards unity , and on the other hand about punishment .
do hon members think that we as a province can be proud of spending r1,4 billion on casinos , creating 12 500 jobs , while it is costing us our families ?
we have no programme to flow out of a policy framework for poverty alleviation and the roll-overs that we spoke about yesterday on poverty alleviation funds have become monotonous .
i appeal to the government - we want confidence in this country and we want them to respect the media in the interests of transparency and good governance .
when is he going to acknowledge the role of alex leguma , whom they chucked out of this country but is widely recognised as one of the best writers the country has ever produced ?
my ministry is fortunate to have good relationships with my national counterparts , which places us in an excellent position to realise our objectives through cooperation of all spheres of government .
i accept as a basic premise that we are all here , each and every single hon member , because we are patriots and have the interests of the province at heart .
taking the challenges of the day into account , there will certainly have to be less political hair-splitting and more dynamism put into the attempts referred to by the hon premier .
the anc took 21,45 % of the vote in ward 32 , and basil van der ross - that hon member knows him very well - the da 's candidate , took 69,85 % .
we can mean a great deal for local government by way of support , information and consistently travelling their road with them - in the western cape in particular , but also in south africa as a whole .
what they have now done is shunted themselves out of the executive committee , where it matters , where decisions are made , and they are going to have no influence on the process .
i also thank the hon member mr gelderblom , who underlined my assertion that those elected representatives who do not make the grade in service delivery will have to make way for those who can .
next i wish to thank the hon member mr lewis for his support for my views on cooperation with local government , but in particular too for his support for the office of premier .
i am surprised that the hon member chose to contrast the approach of the da to the aids crisis with the approach taken by the national government of the anc .
to an extent he showed that he was willing to put away the race card and deal seriously with the real issues that face the people of our province .
mr speaker , before i conclude , i need perhaps to explain something to hon members on that side of the house that those who work with me do not need to have explained .
i have thought carefully about what i am going to say today , and i would like all hon members , especially those from the dp , to be the judge of who is guilty of racism and sectarianism .
what is of grave concern , and certainly is not ludicrous , is the hon minister 's attitude and flagrant disregard for the professionalism and integrity of the people who work in the wced .
while on the one hand they are trying to buy an influence in the muslim community , on the other hand they are quite willing to treat them with contempt and insult them when they see fit .
that might have been true in the days of apartheid , when the old np had a policy for eradicating poverty among the poor whites , but today poverty has no colour .
i hope my information is correct , but i would also like to take the opportunity of welcoming our new bridegroom in the gallery - and we wish him and his partner well .
by the way , mr speaker , i could not but note , when the opening address was being presented , that there was not particularly much interest on that side of the house .
the legal opinion requested by the government of the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism says that the government was totally within its right to call for volunteers to assist it .
i saw us working together in alleviating poverty , not only on the cape flats , but over a broader area - on the farms and in the rural areas .
that is why he can turn around and say , " time does not allow me to speak about the poor people in the province , " when he has said nothing else .
if the hon member mr ozinsky was convinced that there was something that should have been said , he should have used the very next speaker of his party to place one or two things on record .
it is sad , even for us on this side of the house , that someone like the hon member mr marais has been knifed , humiliated and driven from this house so unceremoniously .
to suggest that we asked courtney sampson to come here and twisted his arm is deeply insulting to the integrity of courtney sampson and the iec .
all citizens of the country who make an economic contribution will realise that the provision of certain social services to the previously disadvantaged and general upliftment work are of the utmost importance to a prosperous and peaceful future in the western cape .
in my opinion , the true democracy of the western cape will be sustained largely by incorporating church organisations and actively making them part of the solution of social and socio-economic problems .
i rejected the request by the hon member to address me on a point of explanation because i felt it would create a precedent .
the hon premier talked about a wide range of matters affecting this province , the matters which this province and its people regard as the most important , namely economic development and prosperity for our people .
] sir , the hon member mr mckenzie spoke about bonteheuwel . i am not talking about bonteheuwel ; i am talking about the province , the province as a whole , of which that hon member and i are both part .
it is his right to say what he wants to say from those benches , and it is my right to say what i want to say from the side of the new np .
yet in the eastern cape the anc government had to be subpoenaed by the human rights commission to pay the annual subsidy to farm schools after having failed to do so for three years .
i challenge the hon member ms brown , and i ask her chief whip to pass it on to her , to lodge her complaint - today still - with the human rights commission .
those people are suffering tremendously under this terrible burden that those hon members have inflicted upon them and their only solace is a " dop " in the park every now and then .
however , over the last weekend the company announced that it had been forced to move its production from the western cape to china because they can manufacture the units $ 6 cheaper .
only when we start bringing criminals to trial and manage to successfully convict them in a court of law and lock them up , will ordinary law-abiding south africans feel safe again .
] i want them to tell this house how many of them helped regulate , through legislation , those plans of cruelty , discrimination , racism and our people 's pain and suffering .
in my constituency - the hon minister of transport and works shares it - there are 132 matriculants in the old model c schools and 52 exemptions at the schools in the vredendal and clanwilliam areas .
the anc in this house has a large millstone round its neck , because it is obvious to every responsible financial journal in this country that this province succeeds where other provinces do not .
allocations to the economic services sector took account of environmental issues , the economic importance of capital infrastructure and the sector 's strong potential to generate additional revenue over the next three to four years .
given an increase in unemployment , lower wage increases and the curtailment of some social welfare spending , inequality of income and wealth may actually be increasing at present , resulting in very skewed per capita income distribution .
however , wesgro goes on to report that as we enter the new year the western cape economy is poised for a significant upswing , strengthening the turnaround experienced during the second half of last year .
provincial expenditure growth has been tightly controlled with a predicted growth of a mere 3,8 % in the first year , slowing still further to a forecast 2,7 % in the outer year of the medium term .
the budgeted decrease in gambling taxes for the 2000-01 financial year reflects an anticipated drop in returns from horse racing and sports betting with the advent of the metropolitan casino coming on stream during the next year .
( a ) there is an upward trend in own revenue , from 4,6 % of total revenue to 5,1 % over the mtef period , without taking into account provision for revenue from gambling .
however , an amount of r120 million from the metropolitan casino bid fee received last december have been provided for capital projects in the 1999-2000 adjustments estimates of which the major portion will only be spent in the 2000-01 financial year .
i would therefore wish to thank all those individuals and organisations that participated in these consultations and pledge that it is my intention to continue with this form of partnership .
the committee is encouraged by the fact that the asset register is almost complete and that the department is busy compiling a draft property policy document and trusts that it will be finalised as soon as possible .
the committee expresses its disappointment that although a consumer council had been budgeted for , it is not yet in place and requests the department to give urgent attention to the matter .
mr speaker , many departments , more especially the education department , have used that format to its best and to its fullest , and they have shown us how they intend to spend that money .
mr speaker , the second issue in the hon premier 's vote which i would like to raise is the attitude of the hon minister in the office of the premier towards the standing committee .
the waiting list for housing at housing offices in the metropole , the increase in the number of electricity accounts and the increase in the numbers of empty flats over the past number of years confirms that there has indeed been a tremendous increase .
the strategic objectives as spelt out are mainly geared to improving the living conditions of everyone in this province , as the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism has just spelt out .
we would also like to thank the officials - especially dr stegmann and mr ismay from treasury - for their excellent work and all the other departments for the quality of information supplied by them .
having said that , i would like to point to what we regard as very serious weaknesses and they are also contained in the recommendations of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling ( scof ) .
in many cases at a theoretical level , the wisdom of equity still exists in the house and for that reason i believe that the anc is correct in supporting the budget today .
the biggest challenge to the new management framework was not a set of rules and regulations that had to be mastered , but that it required a paradigm shift from a rule-bound to a results-orientated culture .
the fact that the most critical media have not been able to point a finger at the western cape is thanks to the thorough planning and management applied by the officials of the province .
i shall therefore continue to devote my energies to an effort to influence positively all government structures - local , provincial and national - in the interests of progress , development and peace for everyone in the province .
in the 2000-01 financial year my office will focus on three major areas : consolidation towards coordinated and integrated service provision ; our ideas and discussions on integrated plans , policy formulation and practical guidelines ; and standard setting .
in a world characterised by internet technology and globalisation , this province has the ability to reach out to both regional and international organs of state to benefit the people of the western cape .
] i am concerned that there are large budget increases appropriated to this ministry in the 2000-01 year , mainly for personnel , yet for a variety of reasons concrete policies and actions are yet to materialise .
naturally , like in most highly specialised areas in the civil service , the problem lies in our ability to match or even come close to private sector remuneration levels for these sought-after experts .
she reported to the house that she appointed a deputy director , and the deputy director made it clear today that they are there , but there is no administrative backup .
if we do not reflect the demographics , our children will grow up thinking that there are no leaders in this province apart from white males , apart from wealthy white males , apart from urban wealthy white males .
he says they did not happen - in the same way some hon members in the house say apartheid was not actually so bad , and we blame apartheid for everything .
the issue of a disabled person not being appointed in my office has already been addressed by a concerned group of disabled people from outside , specifically after the deputy director ms marie hendricks was appointed .
] whether they like it or not , they have no choice but to support the budget , instead of making the same mistake that they made in the no-confidence debate .
as i was saying , i addressed the federation of university women of africa , all academics , and part of my theme , to answer the hon member dr van zyl , was the aids epidemic .
the committee recommends that all new and existing co-operation agreements between the western cape government and other governments ( regional , national and international ) be monitored by a multi-party international relations sub-committee of the provincial parliament .
the committee expresses its concern that there is no business plan for poverty relief and recommends that no funds be rolled over to poverty relief until an approved business plan is submitted .
the committee is encouraged by the fact that the asset register is almost complete and that the department is busy compiling a draft property policy document and trusts that it will be finalised as soon as possible .
the committee expresses its disappointment that although a consumer council had been budgeted for , it is not yet in place and requests the department to give urgent attention to the matter .
this year the standing committees will , for the first time , have access to a realistic sum , namely r60 000 per committee , and will be able to decide themselves how they wish to spend it in performing their activities .
the question in this issue is whether the political parties or the administration should administer the funds and which of these should appoint the staff to aid the committee chairpersons .
madam chairperson , let me immediately emphasise that it is not my intention to afford members of this house improper financial support at the expense of our moral responsibility towards the voters out there .
the question one needs to ask is whether this limitation is intended to rein in committee chairpersons of other parties , of which there is now only one .
( 1 ) what progress has been made with regard to consumer protection services , including ( a ) budget , ( b ) staffing , ( c ) a consumer court or related capacity and ( d ) consumer education ;
the hon premier of the province has a responsibility in terms of section 12 of the western cape provincial tender board law , 1994 ( law 8 of 1994 ) , which reads , and i quote :
the requirement for the environmental management plan was a condition of approval issued by the then department of land development coordination in terms of the land use planning ordinance , 1985 .
if , after investigation , it has been determined that conditions of approval have been transgressed , the matter will be taken up with the hon minister of finance and development planning with a view to taking action against the transgressors .
in the light of the new legislation i have amended the procedure and all funding applications are now referred to the funding committee of the western cape cultural commission for consideration .
i would like to ask the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs if there have been any cases where cheques have been made out in this department and they have not been immediately issued to the beneficiaries .
the development at wesbank has been there for some time now , and all along it has been known that people would have to cross the freeway to reach the other side .
in reply to the question by the hon member i want to say that i made the offer that the province also fund the entire " voorbrandfees " because then we can bring our culture to our people .
an interim interdict was granted earlier this year against the cpos involved in the claremont sex workers case , that they refrain from harassing or assaulting the people in question .
if he would like to repeat outside the house that i gave an instruction to the police for something to be done in the thabo mabaso case , he is welcome to do so .
mr speaker , i would like to answer by posing the following question to the hon member : what steps were taken to bring it to my attention so that i could investigate this ?
mr speaker , i would have thought - on a more serious note - that when questions are asked of the premier , they would be relevant questions , but this is absolute nonsense .
this process is precisely aimed at getting the employment equity act off the ground , so that we achieve a better distribution and a better reflection of the demographic situation in the province .
mr speaker , firstly , i have to clear up what is really disinformation , and i must tell hon members that the hon member mr ramatlakane has been mischievous here .
we reckoned - the sums were done and they substantiate our conclusion - that keeping one or two schools open and transporting the children would be a much better system .
obviously it has to be taken to the community , they do have to have time to consult around the issues and usually when it comes to me the issues have been debated and resolved .
as can be seen it has come down from the 370 outstanding applications that the hon member mr ozinsky mentioned to a total of 179 in outstanding applications , which is a significant improvement .
i request any official who feels discriminated against to use the official mechanisms in place to bring the matter , with the necessary substantiation , to my attention .
if , however , the hon member ms phike wants to bring to my attention specific areas where the trains are not being satisfactorily policed , i am quite prepared to look at them .
for example , if one took november 1998 and one compared the kilometres claimed with the kilometres actually travelled , one would see that there is a big difference .
according to the statements made by the hon minister on 16 september 1999 , the policy would have been a far broader perspective on the entire procurement system - that is what a policy is .
really , what she is suggesting is that there is no procurement policy in the province and that we have done nothing about it at all , and that is not correct .
a legal opinion was obtained in this regard and the legal opinion specified very clearly that this relationship is spelt out in the act and that the council can take no action against this person .
all the logos happened to appear on the publicity material , and that was the prerogative of the western cape tourism board , but they had nothing to do with the organisation , and i am advised accordingly .
the courier service which transports examination scripts has been thoroughly investigated by officials from head office to ensure that it complies with specific prescribed security measures for the handling of examination papers and scripts .
we still need to improve , but it must be remembered that it is easier to up a pass rate of 50 % than it is to improve on a pass rate of 80 % .
i would like to draw the attention of the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism to the fact that there was a degree of concern among the committee members regarding the continued rolling over of funds .
it is to be allocated as follows : tourism marketing and the cape online project , r1,4 million ; the resealing and upgrading of roads , r11,8 million ; general provincial building works , r1,8 million ; and upgrading hospitals and clinics , r1,9 million .
mr speaker , when we talk about education , health and welfare , we must ask ourselves the question : why do our brothers and sisters from the eastern cape and other provinces come to this province ?
i have letters here that i wrote to the mayor of cape town on certain things that i would like her to do , of which i have not even had an acknowledgement .
the funding is forwarded directly to schools in the form of transfer payments and this is spent by the schools on repairs resulting from vandalism , as well as other emergencies not related to vandalism .
mr speaker , in answer to the hon member mr gelderblom 's question , the natural exodus of police from the service in the western cape is currently running at between 40 and 60 members a month .
it is anticipated - and that will be settled with the chairperson of the standing committee on economic development - that the draft green paper will be discussed with the portfolio committee during july 2000 .
mr speaker , can the hon minister of education tell me what happened to a certain school 's tractor , and whether that tractor was also transferred to another school ?
on account of the fact that the said houses were allegedly built before 1935 , when the sea shore act came into operation , the legal accounting for the existence of these houses falls outside the authority of this office .
mr speaker , does the hon premier think it is possible that the house could ask him to get a progress report from the department of home affairs regarding the 1 000 outstanding cases ?
i respect him for seeing the president , but perhaps the department of home affairs should give account to the province of what they are doing to process these 1 000 applications .
madam chairperson , while on the subject of gambling , i recently travelled to las vegas in the company of the chairperson and members of the western cape gambling and racing board .
however , due to personnel shortages and the lack of dedicated and fully trained staff , along with inadequate systems for managing arrear debtor accounts , the finalisation of debt still fails to meet expectations .
if a satisfactory explanation - satisfactory to scof or the house - is not received , the hon minister of finance and development planning should consider having a multiparty team look at this question .
we should never land up in a situation in which the money that we spend - besides the social problems that occur - is going to be more than the money that the casino generates .
i thought employment would be done in such a way as to reduce the 40 % unemployment figure we have in the western cape , and that is not happening at the moment .
] he is haunted by policy - whether it is the red policy or the shell house policy i do not know , but he keeps on about his policy .
i would like to draw attention to the fact , in relation to the delays referred to by one of the speakers , that it was with scof for the period from november 1997 to april 1998 .
that the house congratulates uxolo high school on their achievement in producing a team to represent the western cape in the international cross-country competition in morocco and wishes them all success in morocco .
firstly , training will be extended from six weeks to eight weeks and will include a week 's in-service training , followed by a week of advanced training suited for street patrols .
one thing i like about the hon minister is that he did not just declare war on crime , like some other who said , " we now have war against crime " .
the highest levels of crime occur in the western cape , followed by gauteng and kwazulu-natal , while the free state and the northern province are the safest provinces to live in according to the most recent hsrc opinion poll .
madam chairperson , the last thing one wants to see here is a kind of recce exercise where young people are basically oriented to guide them in the direction of a kind of kassinga .
we need to improve the standards of ordinary policemen and policewomen by introducing performance-related pay packages providing rewards for excellence and by putting into place bursary schemes and incentives to improve qualifications .
in fact , i would suggest that he speak to the hon member mr silke , who correctly quoted that 95 % of the people enjoy living in the western cape .
these are all extraordinary efforts by civil society to protect itself because the anc government is not prepared to protect them , while it is their responsibility to do so .
another feature of the coming year is that the department of community safety will engage in a chrysalis project to develop young people at risk and to provide them with life skills , especially those in the coaching of sport .
it is the intention of the national minister to reduce the size of the commission and to retain most of the policy-making and decision-making powers in his ministry and the core department .
i commend the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation and the officials in his department on these initiatives to keep the youth off the streets , away from gangsterism and drugs .
if we are successful in winning the bid for the 2006 soccer world cup , it will , no doubt , mean an important boost for the sporting and economic life of the province and south africa as a whole .
i am certain that these matters can be developed satisfactorily to the benefit of all role-players , especially the young children who , after all , carry our hopes and our dreams for the future .
we are traditionally used to textbooks , but increasingly access to the worldwide web , photocopiers and so on have broadened and changed our understanding of what texts mean - they incorporate a range of sources and resources .
we therefore continue to encourage schools that have the capacity to do so to move way beyond our six critical success factors , right along the continuum .
rejecting that university 's demands for more money , he said giving in to this demand would be tantamount " to putting money into a money shredder " .
mr chairperson , we have invested substantial resources in all these schools , and in most of them there have been significant improvements , which is the result of a combination of resources and good management .
we want to monitor whether there is a decline in quality in disadvantaged schools that have lost resources , or whether they are able to maintain and even , if possible , improve their performance .
all the schools , and many others besides , were given a detailed time on task schedule compiled by dr frans booyse to help them with time management during the year 2000 .
the focus of the past year has been on preparing for curriculum 2005 in grades 3 and 7 , more particularly preparing our educators for the challenge and changes that this implies .
mr chairperson , performance in mathematics and science in many of our disadvantaged schools , particularly the former det schools , is nothing short of disastrous if we are looking at entering the global knowledge economy .
mr chairperson , we have successfully run pilot curriculum development projects under the auspices of the national qualifications framework in collaboration with commerce and industry in areas as diverse as mechanical engineering , business studies , hospitality studies , hair care and cosmetology .
we will also spend some r2,5 million on planning new schools , and r2 million on purchasing new mobile classrooms or relocating them to areas of greatest need .
this report was adopted by the national cabinet and president mbeki , then still in his capacity as deputy president , requested all relevant departments to implement the recommendations contained in the report as soon as possible .
in 1997 - and these are very worrying figures - out of the 38 000 candidates who wrote matric in the western cape , 30 % failed science and 49 % failed maths .
this breakfast will be attended by very prominent figures from the private sector who will be asked to take part in a revolutionary programme to upgrade maths and science in the province .
fourthly , no pupil can make desirable progress and no teacher can render his / her best service within and outside the classroom unless this takes place within a safe , attractive and well-equipped environment .
this statutory amendment provides that the post of a member of a management body which from the beginning of this year is no longer a parent , falls vacant , and that a by-election must be held .
madam chairperson , let me take this opportunity to congratulate the officials of the department , especially mr brian o ' connell , for their hard work and commitment to their work .
it is acknowledged that this cannot be said of all schools and the hon minister of education and the department face many challenges to deal with schools that manifest problems .
in fact , i can say exactly the same about the hon member ms vantura , who has been passionately interested and involved in education for as long as i have known her , and that has been about 15 years .
we can attribute everything to past policies forever - it is enormously convenient to do that - or we can take responsibility and try to do something about it .
i am just wondering - i want to draw this to the attention of the hon minister - whether the department has taken hiv / aids into account as a confounding factor when calculating tb cure rates .
secondly , i appeal to the general practitioners of the western cape to be proactive and contact the elderly to remind them to have their flu prevention vaccination .
a key focus should be to improve the health status of women and ensure that mechanisms are created so that no mother dies because of a lack of access to health care and / or services .
in a secondary hospital , this person would have observation for the development of problems and be transferred to a tertiary hospital for a r1 000 cat scan only if problems developed .
i am pleased to say , though - i must compliment the department on this - that the amount of supernumeraries has now been reduced from a somewhat unwieldy 328 to a more modest 46 .
madam chairperson , what it does not say is what has always been said in this house by all the ministers of health here in the new dispensation : there has been an honesty about deficits .
the practice , and i am sure the hon member mr marais would say the same , has been that we as ministers have personally signed voluntary severance packages , but we signed them within an agreed framework .
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 8 - trade , industry and tourism of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1999 [ pr 16 / 2000 ] .
special report of the auditor-general on the outstanding financial statements in respect of local governments in the province of the western cape as at 30 september 1999 and 31 december 1999 [ pr 34 / 2000 ] .
the exchange of information and sharing of experiences between representatives of civil society in the different countries form an important part of the commonwealth 's activities at the start of the 21st century .
madam chairperson , more calmly , and for record purposes , my office is currently engaged in taking the process further for the appointment of the consultant established by the previous minister .
- encouraging and supporting local community development projects that foster the skills , self-reliance and self-confidence of people living in poverty and that facilitate their active participation in efforts to eradicate poverty .
in addition , i thank the hon member mr marais especially because , after all , this budget , as well as all the work for poverty alleviation , is the result of his commitment , his passionate commitment , to his people .
mr chairperson , i should start my speech in the debate today by adding to the salutes that have been given in the house to the officials of the department of social services .
one of these pressures seem to be very close to the heart of the hon member ms brown as well as to my own , namely the plight of street children in our province and in our country .
they should be utilised to serve the poor and to develop those special programmes that the department wants to provide to address specific needs in the communities .
we also have a budget of r227 million for social services , which is the part of the r2,2 billion budget that actually goes into keeping the social fabric of our province together .
right up to 25 february 2000 , the officials of my department and i were scurrying around trying to adjust our planning for the 2000-01 financial year to accommodate a dramatic cut in our budget .
another problem that we are faced with is the fact that the pre-emptive right that previously existed in respect of a state house was done away with at the inception of the new subsidy policy .
i sincerely hope , however , that the new members joining our team will display the same dedication as those who have already been striving for years to improve the lot of others .
] there are many hundreds and thousands of our people throughout this province who sleep on our streets and in our parks at night or in shelters run by a small group of dedicated welfare workers .
] they have failed to live up to promises and commitments made in previous speeches and in many instances have allowed lethargy , administrative chaos and inertia to go unchecked .
i believe the new consolidation of the department under one roof will prove to be more efficient and ultimately lead to better housing control , management and delivery in this province .
mr chairperson , i am pleased to hear of the progress that the hon minister and his department have made , but providing a home in this province is not enough .
it is a struggle for a caring society , a society free from class exploitation , free from the oppression of women and free from racism in how the wealth is consumed .
the fund , as one of its priorities , should begin to address the actual end product of the present housing scheme , because the larger part of the subsidy goes towards the development of land , related infrastructure and developers .
] the advice that i would give that hon member is that he should go to that local authority or should write them a letter and send me a copy .
the hon member ms essop did not take part in the debate today , but she knows that whenever she has asked me for an appointment because she needs information , i have never yet refused .
i think that project viability can really play a critical role in assisting the current dysfunctional municipalities in improving their administrative capacity and financial affairs prior to the consolidation and transformation of local government .
regarding the local government : municipal demarcation act , 1998 ( act 27 of 1998 ) , i just want to say that the outer boundaries of our municipalities have now been demarcated and there is a reduction .
dr myburgh 's programme would actually help the hon minister to indicate this to his hon members , including that hon member who opens his mouth time and time again and talks nonsense .
i am saddened to hear the previous speaker , the hon member mr mckenzie again assume that the anc has a monopoly on knowing the realities of what happens in south africa .
if we are to fight poverty effectively through urban renewal , spatial development and formal and informal training sector development , there will have to be closer intersectoral cooperation between organised local government and the province .
the purpose of the application to the high court is to have the decision set aside to enable me to comply with the legal requirements of evaluating the application .
the planning of these spheres means the provincial planning department must work very closely with nature conservation , national government and local government with good planning interchange and links , and good planning principles .
while looking through the transfer payments in the pink book , i noticed for example that in the southern cape payments have been allocated to belvedere estate , brenton , noetzie , sedgefield , outeniqua trc , the district council and knysna municipality .
i would further like to ask the hon minister whether the integrated development frameworks and plans will be rendered inadequate , or whether the new municipality will have to start the process all over again .
i am proud to stand in this house today and say that if i had had to make a political decision on dassenberg , i might not have come to the same decision .
when i saw for the first time the qualifications required of the review board it occurred to me that very few of our people would really apply to serve on that review board .
it obliges us to ensure that the environment is not harmful to the health and well-being of our people , and to prevent pollution , promote conservation and secure sustainable development .
firstly , it should engender an awareness that man 's existence and survival depend on the sustainability of scarce resources , which in turn are dependent on man 's interaction with the environment .
to quote director janet pillai who chairs the committee for her department , " the more we keep silent , the more we propagate the ignorance and stigmatisation surrounding the disease .
they include the chiming bells christmas band , crusaders christmas choir , guiding stars christmas choir , the perseverance christmas band , the st celia christmas band , the western cape christmas band union and the young guiding stars .
i am reluctant to reopen it , but what i will do , if the hon member likes , is to go and speak to the angling club at the first opportunity i get .
[ the minister of transport and works : madam chairperson , the dawn of the new millennium confronts us with questions and challenges , which we would like to face with enthusiasm and experience .
this will also , in turn , provide sustainable direct job opportunities and definitely have a positive long-term development in the areas that it serves - and i know that the department strongly supports public / private partnerships .
we are disappointed to hear once again that the only way that transport can generate extra revenue - and we understand it - is the 15 % or 20 % increase in licensing fees .
for example , i call to mind the hon member mr ismail , who joined me in the struggle for a long time , and the hon member mr gelderblom , who now has to take the long road to oudtshoorn .
i continued that the collective task of the people was to remove this coalition in the coming local government elections in order that we , together with the councillors , could implement the rdp .
the implications of that legislation are so great and from the outset the western cape protested strongly at the total overlooking of the man in the street , smaller local authorities , ngos , the taxi associations and so on .
i would also like to know if the hon minister and the department have received any unsolicited bids for such toll-roads or if any such approaches have been made via the national roads agency .
i wonder if this practice cannot perhaps be changed , as there are many small businesses across the province who manufacture standard number-plates and would be able to produce these special plates .
when i had read his speech i still , disappointingly , did not find any sentiments expressed as to how he was going to use the works budget to promote smmes .
therefore they might as well forget about registering in the northern cape , the eastern cape , mpumalanga and elsewhere , because the trucks that operate from a base and an office in the western cape have to register in the western cape .
however , the chair cannot forbid hon members to make use of that right , but on the other hand it is the right of other hon members to record their objections immediately .
madam chairperson , i would like to illustrate these characteristics with reference to two western cape companies - in very different sectors - that i believe are well-placed to meet these challenges .
by support we understand policy formulation , the provision of the legal and regulatory framework , institutional elements , fiscal interventions , capacity building , support for enterprise development , tourism planning and development , education , training and awareness , and the provision of general infrastructure .
these applications are not only for new licences , but are for removal of licences , transfers of licences , conversions of licences and other types of applications provided for in the liquor act .
it is a splendid team and without them i would not have been able to present what i think is a good report and a good prognosis to the house .
for a long time , for the six years that i have now spent in government , not once have we ever been on a training course or an entrepreneurial course to equip us to change .
i was privileged to take with me as my guest to listen to the national minister of finance 's speech an individual who has invested more than $ 200 million in this country .
i am also very pleased that the hon minister has moved away from the fanciful notions of a knowledge economy , and has begun to say what we have been saying for some time on this side of the house .
the key challenge is to grapple with transformation across a broad spectrum of sectors , recognising that agro-industry and tourism are central and critical for growth and jobs .
the province must move to a second phase in its evolution as a destination for tourism , or else the momentum that has been created as a result of the olympic bid and new projects development will be lost .
regarding the current liquor board 's conduct , i have specifically requested on a number of occasions that if there are any concrete cases of discrimination against people who apply , i should be given them .
to answer that question , and to develop a strategy to combat the problem , it is necessary to consider the theory of the farm problem , which has been analysed notably by one cochran .
not only has international experience shown that in so doing the cost of technology development can be significantly lowered , but it will result in the most up-to-date technology being available to the farmers .
the delegation will meet the respective ministers of agriculture , visit new farmer projects in rural areas and enter into discussions with high profile officials who have been instrumental in the settlement of new farmers in these countries .
he informs me that people from the town came to him last year for the first time in his life to ask whether they could do pruning work on the farm .
it will be a good idea to make the farmers aware of these projects so that they can see that the state is prepared to make state land available for settlement projects of this kind .
we object to the expenditure of the amount of r4,004 million budgeted in vote 1 , programme 1 , subprogramme 2 - the budget for the minister in the office of the premier .
my understanding is that because the schedule is now more detailed , we can vote on the vote and on the subprogrammes ; that is why the subprogrammes are detailed in the schedule .
the national minister of transport has already committed his full support to this end and has even undertaken to ask the national minister of defence to provide further physical support .
in vredenburg codeta tried to take over the jurisdiction from the local vredenburg taxi association , and in grabouw the codeta-affiliated association prevented long distance taxis operating in terms of their permits .
finally we conceded that this should be dealt with by the powers of the minister to act in accordance with certain regulations , which is dealt with very broadly in section 30 .
here the minister may make regulations providing for one or more routes to be declared areas that will be closed , and the minister may issue temporary permits to operators other than illegal operators .
- yes indeed , it is a question of that hon member not having the capacity to persist - should step up direct liaison and work with our community in order to counteract crime .
good , god-fearing law-abiding citizens are being brutally murdered on an unprecedented scale and their killers are allowed to live out the rest of their lives in upgraded jails paid for by their victims .
and while all these things are happening we are perhaps silly and nave to think a 50-minute parliamentary debate could be the panacea we so urgently seek .
let the super liberals who cannot stand the thought of vengeance against murderers - in the form of hanging - once and for all realise that they are a tiny minority .
if they cannot control an effective police force at provincial or national level , it is time that the new unicities decide whether they should have their own law and order departments .
mr speaker , when i say that various organisations should become involved in the establishment of a human rights culture i really wish to underline the role that our churches ought to play in the process .
the government took an incorrect decision , and that incorrect decision was to allow the numbers in the police service to drop from 200 000 to its current level of 127 000 .
] secondly , it was because of their commitment to democracy and to enhancing the enfranchisement of the disenfranchised voters out there that they had done this .
mr speaker , i would like to point out that there are always squeals from that side of the house that we are not looking after the interests of the poorest of the poor .
mr speaker , i believe that what is behind this is a great fear on that side of the house that we are proceeding with a similar project in order to register more people in the province .
madam chairperson , if the hon member ms essop could put the question to me again , i will give her a detailed reply and i will definitely come up with a breakdown of the information .
in the light of the fact that he has said 787 000 voters were registered , could he firstly say how he arrived at that figure ; secondly , where the ...
we spent the money on registering voters to keep democracy alive ; otherwise we would have gone the route of kaunda - make everybody ministers for life , and then there are no elections .
madam chairperson , i would like to know from the hon minister of social services and poverty relief : if the savings come from people dying , what steps is he taking to effect these savings .
all i have is that the breakdown of the two expenses that hon members see were for wages paid to people involved in registration of voters .
madam chairperson , could the hon minister , as a follow-up to my previous question about details , inform the house whether , if on receipt of the details she finds that she is not satisfied , ...
madam chairperson , i would like the hon member to direct the question to the hon minister of local government , because my department made virtually no contribution towards that amount .
madam chairperson , could the hon minister , whoever he is of the three of them , who is responsible for the third amount give us an explanation from which programme or subprogramme that amount came ?
if members raise issues and questions during debate and in their speeches , it depends on the particular minister as to how he / she is going to deal with those questions or the contents of those speeches .
i have put the third reading and although one side of the house consented , she as a person made use of that rule and said that she did not want to do it .
if investment is located in that established line of the northern and western parts of the metropole , investment merely relocates and displaces , rather than creates new opportunities and new employment .
our inherited infrastructure in the western cape , superior to most other provinces , will always attract investment , but that can be turned around if there is the pathology of bombs starting to go off again .
he cannot simply say , " i am the premier of all the people " , and then , like magic , racism disappears , africans feel at home , and farm workers feel respected .
in such a debate the only winners are the huge pharmaceutical companies , and the losers are those living with hiv / aids and will give an impression that a cure exists .
i also want to give a special word of thanks to the provincial commissioner , commissioner lennit max , and the officer commanding task force west , maj-gen chris van zyl , with their staff for their enormous contribution .
this is a specific challenge which the government will have to react to , and i say it once again in the absence of the hon premier but in the presence of the hon minister of community safety .
his wisdom is clearly to be seen in his opening address because a strategic and responsible leader , in whatever capacity he serves or stands , knows how to balance expectations and reality .
mr speaker , it is a pity that the hon member mr a j williams did not mention today that on a farm in the western cape there are farm workers who earn r7 a week .
i fully support the minister when he says that farmers should give the department of labour access to their farms because at the end of the day we need to implement the laws of this country .
were these things that were simply said before the elections as promises , or does the hon premier intend to give a helping hand to the people of st montague village and riebeeck-kasteel ?
this priority can only improve the situation in this area , and i am sure that with the dedication of the hon minister of health and his department we will see meaningful results .
for those hon members who might be a bit shocked to see me in the chair and not the speaker , i am just one of the panel of temporary chairpersons .
] we shall watch them to see whether the anc has the courage later in the course of this year to reward the hon member ms brown for her hard work .
in the recent election campaign we also found on more than one occasion that our farm workers were threatened with , " vote for the da and you will be killed together with the farmers " .
mr speaker , on a point of order : are you not worried that the man who has just left the chair , does not know what a point of order is ?
it is immoral to play games with the lives of innocent people who live daily with the discrimination and stigma of being hiv-positive for cheap political point scoring .
the hon premier and this government cannot escape the responsibility and the culpability for what has happened to this unfortunate group of 31 people from the karoo , here near to us at piketberg .
the hon leader of the opposition knows , as a former minister of health , there is a who essential drugs list , a national essential drugs list and a provincial essential drugs list .
a neatly dressed , modern young man told of how he had known about aids in south africa for years but only about two weeks before he had begun to believe and accept that aids was caused by hiv .
in fact , some r615 000 in vote 3 - finance for the hospital information system project is as a result of this , and also some r319 000 for library services is as a result of that deteriorating exchange rate .
and i am sure that the hon minister of community safety agrees - that what we are required to do is to see that cameras are put in throughout the aeas where there is excessive crime .
i will get back to the hon member mr strachan if there were kmos and tell him what those kmos are , or get back to him to say there were no kmos .
the cameras on vanguard drive , by the way , were motivated also by enormous theft out of vehicles at the intersections long before the casino , out at the squatter camp which hon members know is along the side there .
this had a number of businesses as partners and it developed a regeneration programme for that area in which grandwest is certainly a leading partner , but there are many other business organisations involved as well .
that the house expresses its deepest sympathy with the next of kin of those who died in a tragic accident in vanrhyns pass outside vanrhynsdorp last tuesday , and further wishes all the injured a speedy recovery .
while the people out there are trying to put this into a racial context , there is no way that the acdp is going to underwrite that because we believe it is about the delivery of service .
we need to think about what mechanism or waiver to use , including the extent of the moratorium on those people whose cars have been standing idle because the system has kicked them out administratively .
] the minister of community safety , sport and recreation : mr speaker , i heard the previous speaker , the hon member ms phenduka talk about why this matter was being raised in the house .
] we are going out , begging the business community to employ those police officers full-time to bolster the police strength in this province because they are 3 500 police officers under strength .
surely , following the debates in the house , they should have known that as soon as the legislation was passed they had to hold discussions on the issue , but they did it only two weeks later .
mr speaker , here are the other promises that the hon minister made - the vision cannot be faulted - and i quote again on p 232 :
we do all this for the sake of peace in this province and so that a company that operates lawfully is permitted to render its service to the people in regard to which it has a contract .
it is actually no problem - it is just a question of having a notice of motion printed on the order paper today , and preference being given on tuesdays to interpellations and questions .
the bill clearly provides in clause 3 , " objects of convenco " , for the process of construction and development to be initiated and the ensuring of appropriate policies and guidelines .
i ask because if we do not have the power to issue guarantees , we certainly will not have the power to indemnify pursuant to the issuing of such guarantees .
the gambling board agreed to allow sunwest to contribute r140 million , and agreements were signed on 6 december 1999 between convenco and sunwest , the preferred bidder for the metro casino licence .
apparently the only cvs linked with this list were those of the hon ministers of economic affairs and tourism and of finance and development planning , and mr ian douglas and another gentleman .
madam chairperson , the issue of the amendment by deleting the word " convenco " and replacing it with the word " shareholders " is not in dispute here .
the committee wishes to express its concern that documentation between the department and the treasury , which may have precluded the incurrence of this unauthorised expenditure , had gone astray due to the lack of proper control .
the department must also report on the proper control over leases and the allocation of tenders which was envisaged to be implemented by 1 april 2000 , within 15 days of the date of this report .
that the house congratulates the khoi community with the celebrations in oudtshoorn this coming weekend , where dr r boesak will be sworn in as chief and further expresses the hope that the proceedings will be successful .
mr speaker , the transformation of local government has already come a long way , with certain processes that have already been put in place , among other things the demarcation of boundaries of categories a , b and c municipalities .
council members who are democratically elected by voters ought to have the right to participate in decision-making processes in the execution of their duties in order to serve the people who elect them .
executive mayors are not elected by voters directly ; they are appointed by party bosses and , if i know the anc , by their top leaders - without resort to any fair and democratic internal election procedure .
although we advertised this last year on two occasions , they said - and i state the facts to hon members - that they are waiting for a service delivery model before taking a decision .
i now turn to the statement made that the new np or any party is afraid to establish an executive mayor because we are afraid we shall lose the election .
it is understandable that the judges , and even the magistrates , may fear that if in the opinion of the anc they pass the wrong judgment , their lives may be in danger .
unfortunately one cannot say with any confidence that all the apartheid era judges who are now part of the present judiciary have been purged of the failings which dugard and other lawyers have pointed out .
certainly the values and attitudes displayed by certain apartheid era judges could not and would not be expurgated by merely taking an oath of allegiance to the democratic constitution of a country .
we allowed the previous two speakers to put their case , and we , as a democratic institution , are going to allow all the other hon members to participate in the debate on the motion .
the second reason why we left the labour party and joined the np at that time was the fact that we were tired of opposition politics and wanted to come back into the mainstream of politics where the power was .
let me state very clearly that when we joined the np , not one member of the coloured group who joined the party at the time supported np principles .
] they want to get into bed with the new np and they have been " vry " -ing up hill and down dale to do that , and we saw a repeat of it here today .
the fact of the matter is that we know that the most important thing we have to do is limit their power for the sake of democracy in south africa , and we will do that .
that is why we are finding this influx of white support to the dp - because on the right wing of white society they perceive it as , " daai jood baklei harder teen die kaffers .
in other words , the anc believes that if the new np tries to be involved in essentially white oppositional politics , it is merely perpetuating its sins of the past and its demise will be speeded up .
condemns the existence of such practices and calls on the dp and the new np to commit themselves to policies which promote support for smmes , particularly in african and coloured communities .
the dp - led by the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism - has found an opportunity for its party-political agenda , thus using a political office negatively for advantage , for its party agenda .
firstly , a lack of access to basic opportunities , business training , skills , finance and information ; and , secondly , the burden of compliance with excessive restrictive legislation and taxes which cost much productive time and money .
mr speaker , the disappointing feature of the portfolio committee hearings was that all the television cameras and radio microphones were there during the morning , and the journalists were listening to what the banking industry had to say .
however , i should like to know whether the hon member mr strachan is still a member of the house , because i regularly answer the questions which he asked when he is not present .
the unauthorised expenditure amounting to r18 216,48 arising from expenditure on the vote in respect of salary benefits paid to the support staff of the leader of the opposition in the 1997-98 financial year , was considered .
what apparently set the alarm bells ringing in the lounges of constantia , hout bay and clifton is that the bill allows municipalities to determine categories of property according to the area in which the property is situated .
the whole issue of debates relates to the fact that the da is hopelessly divided on these particular policy issues , and because of that they could not make a submission to the unicity commission .
it will not get off the ground in the case where the community can express its opinion on whether it wants better services and whether it is prepared to pay for them .
madam speaker , today the hon member mr mckenzie has a tygerberg tie on , and i see that he has also received a fine letterhead from tygerberg , but who is in control of the city of tygerberg ?
madam speaker , i initially had a question , but i am obliged by what is happening in the house to raise a point of order , if that is in order .
however , the fact is that all around the world , not only in south africa , security has to be beefed up amongst all sections of the population because crime is spreading and it is a global phenomenon .
if the farming community should collapse as a result of a total breakdown in security , the rural economy and the state 's authority in these areas would most probably follow suit .
if the level of murders in the commercial agricultural community , including black farmers , is expressed as a group , it amounts to 274 farmers per 100 000 of the population being murdered per year .
the committee wishes to thank professor van der berg for the role that he played in the outcome based budget process and appreciates the information he provided to members on the western cape economy .
for the sake of order , we can just look at those parts of the motion that overlap and if necessary consult the hon members as to what is ultimately printed on the order paper .
before i attend to the motion , i have to point out that the hon minister of social services cannot tell any hon member of the house to " shut up " .
on 18 august 2000 , two months later , we received a response from the hon premier on the matter in which he stated that he would not be able to obtain the audit for us .
they cannot allow the south peninsula municipality to continue in this trend , because the big cover-up was done under the control of the new np and not the other political parties .
mr speaker , it seems as if i am hitting the nail on the head here , because the hon member mr mckenzie has been jumping up and down so much that one cannot believe it .
i have thoroughly perused the van niekerk report and i am of the view , and was also subsequently so advised , that no prima facie evidence exists to justify the appointment of a commission of inquiry .
in fact , sir , the draft code of conduct goes even further than that and says that one can continue sitting in on the discussion ; one must simply declare the interest .
let me tell hon members that i do not care what the colour of the people on that board is , as long as they can make sure that we have a successful convention centre .
bills received from national parliament and tabled by the speaker in terms of rule 208 : ( i ) developmental welfare governance bill [ b43-2000 ] .
i am asking the hon minister to do everything in his power so that we can stop this terrorism and bring whoever is responsible to the conference table so that we can find a solution .
it was only last year when , during a family stroll in newlands forest , he was confronted in public by members of pagad and had to endure all kinds of insulting and unpleasant remarks in the presence of his child .
i think there should be no misunderstanding on this point - those who seek to undermine the rule of law and our constitution will suffer the consequences of their actions .
thirdly , mr speaker , it is morally wrong and politically stupid to play politics with people 's lives , and for that reason i am very pleased we are having this debate today .
blacks , like all other people , can be sure that their constitutional rights are adequately protected and that they will have equal access to all sources of power should they seek redress of grievances .
mr speaker , the reality of the current position - from their own document - is that in senior management posts in this province , out of the total in the senior management echelon 70,16 % are white .
they seek out every possible incident of racism , and even invent some , and certainly invent quotes whenever they can , so they can engage in their favourite pastime of populist , racist demagoguery .
racism , as we knew it in the old south africa , had to do with the denial of the rights of certain people and the claiming of so many rights that people could not even handle .
i can understand to some extent if the new np does it , and only to some extent , because they still have to undergo the paradigm shift and understand the demands of the new constitution .
] however , we on this side of the house will never support the blatant exploitation of so-called racism issues and the pursuing of such an agenda for short-term political gain by the ruling party .
it is obvious , too , that judging from the hon member ms essop 's attitude to white males , the hon members messrs dugmore , ozinsky and strachan should be packing their bags and leaving for somewhere else .
whilst i recognise that racism exists and that there is a need for transformation in our society , such transformation surely cannot occur at the expense of reclassifying people according to race .
surely it is well-known that on the instructions of the hon premier discussions were held last year with experts at a high level to rectify the structure of the administration .
i rectified this matter and every department has to come back to me and tell me exactly what they have done with that money , a total of r137 million , because that money will be used .
this was done with great fanfare and with people on motor cycles and when the people waved to their president , they let go of the handlebars and fell in clouds of dust .
( 1 ) recognises that millions of south africans experience inadequate or no service from the banking sector , and suffer from red-lining , racism , excessive bank charges , and unregulated blacklisting by credit bureaux ; and
( b ) the plight of the fishing communities in coastal towns such as arniston , gansbaai and kleinmond , who are only employed for four months a year and have to survive without an income for the rest of the year ;
( 3 ) thanks all chief invigilators and invigilators at the examination centres for their willingness to help with this enormous task , and at the same time requests them to keep the credibility of the examination above suspicion ;
that the house notes and congratulates the provincial government and the former minister of community safety , sport and recreation on the unheralded success with the chrysalis project , which addressed issues and needs of youth at risk in the province .
it is also the case that the anc is the only party in south africa and specifically in the western cape that unselfishly devotes itself to improve living conditions and to uplift the farm workers .
] the saps report for the last quarter of 1999 indicated that in almost 87,9 % of cases of violence on farms there was no form of relationship between the perpetrator and the victim .
] besides the lawlessness that has overtaken zimbabwe 's farms - listen to this - president mugabe 's seizure of 2 000 white-owned farms is paralysing commercial agriculture .
we asked the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works to follow this up , and he stands up with a smile and speaks as if that is not the case .
to make the exception the rule , and on top of that , to cast suspicion on the agricultural industry as a whole makes no constructive contribution towards job creation or economic growth in the rural environment .
in certain cases , the bargaining council also indicated that it was not prepared or mandated to grant the requested exemption to deviate from the collective agreements in this regard .
5. vote 12 - education ( auditor-general 's report [ pr 66 / 2000 - page 2 , paragraph 2.2.1 ( b ) ] ) : non-compliance with western cape provincial tender board directives : unauthorised expenditure , r30 998 125,20
the committee heard and considered evidence with regard to the circumstances surrounding the purchase of a desk counter unit for r8 300 , which indicated a significant disregard for and lack of training in compliance with tender board prescriptions .
the committee recommends that the amount of r22 723 be authorised by the provincial parliament and that the process of procurement once again be brought to the attention of all the staff of the provincial administration .
the committee wishes to express its concern that funds generated by activities relating to the provision of housing had not been allocated to this function and therefore recommends that -
not a single minister could stand up in the committee stage and provide explanations or account for the amounts expended in both schedules 1 and 2 , ...
he said in his letter that the director-general of public service and administration , dr ncholo , had worked out and was disseminating the compensation policy for all personnel who wished to be deployed .
however , i also at the same time promised that we would do our utmost to create a safe and stable investment climate in the western cape and that we would look at the poorest of the poor .
the effect of the r135 million raised from the metropolitan casino bid fees has been that the previous own revenue target has been increased by a net r127,256 million , from r443,260 million to r570,516 million .
unfortunately , the acdp 's exclusion has led to the fact that we will be moving a motion in the unicity commission , calling for the setting aside of the election of the executive .
the idealistic and very noble notions of building and nurturing our new democracy , encouraging accountability and transparency , and taking care of the poor are no more .
what the da has successfully done in the western cape in the past election - and we take our hats off to that - is to scare the hell out of the whites , ...
mr speaker , it is a disgrace for the chief whip , the hon member mr king , someone who has been in parliament for so many years , to raise such a point of order .
we laid down that if the owner was in error , the local authority should have first option to help people lower down on the waiting-list , and after that the provincial government and then the central government .
those are the same words that the nazis used in germany and those are the same words that are used in britain by the national front - the " influx " from outside .
mr speaker , the horrific and inhuman poverty that exists in our city is so degrading that it is unbelievable that there are so many people who still preserve their sanity and are law-abiding .
they say that since the 1994 democratic change in south africa everything has gone wrong , and this one picks up when hon members on that side of the house talk about the good old days .
i would also like to congratulate all the teachers who worked diligently to give the best to our children to prepare them for the future - sometimes under very difficult circumstances .
our hon minister of education is eager about time on task , that children should be in class and that teachers should teach , and she is hard on lapses there .
as the provincial government we need to win back the confidence of all the poor people , and we need to work closely with ngos if we want to see meaningful change , especially in the lives of women and children .
in fact , our record of delivery is so strong that the anc has not focused its attack on this aspect , but set its sights on breaking up the coalition through racist rhetoric .
for years we in the anc , in the ngos and in all our structures have fought for the rights of children , the aged and the disabled but our voices were not heard .
both the hon premier and the hon member mr louis have on previous occasions spoken about riding a horse and hon members will remember that the hon premier said they were like horse chestnut .
he prevented his own leadership in the southern cape from asking questions and at least stating their views so that they could hear the response of the hon premier and the cabinet .
] what he did not tell us is that it is also mentioned that other organs of state , which would include municipalities and the province , must assist this institution through legislative and other measures .
mr speaker , i would like to clarify the following point once and for all : the hon member mr ozinsky did not invite the rev samson from the iec to the house today .
the western cape is in fact a real rose amongst the thorns when we compare it to the other provinces in this country , such as the anc-run eastern cape , with its crumbling infrastructure and its out-of-control , unchecked corruption .
] the provincial congress of the anc admitted last week , in the presence of die burger , that their numbers had fallen and that their mps and mpps were not showing up at their party structures .
mr speaker , the hon premier referred to the influx , and when he did so , then he was condemned as if he had used a bad word in the house .
i issue the same challenge to the hon minister as i did at the telkom meeting - the point is not about getting somebody only to do a once-off .
in essence the hon premier is asking us to abide by the attitude of the dp in the house and sweep the matter of racism under the carpet and refuse to deal with it .
i have not seen a statement from the anc in the past 48 hours with regard to the headline treatment of the non-payment of the attorneys for defending the poorest of the poor pro deo .
mr speaker , it is clear from his address , and the officials have confirmed this , that we have an hon minister who is unable to come up with a plan .
when apartheid was at its height , former president p w botha would never have dreamt of reducing question time , or dared to do so , because that is an occasion on which the government is called to account .
for the information of the hon minister of agriculture , mr baadjies decided that morning not to go to work , but , for whatever reason , to go to the shops .
the farm owner drew up next to him , searched their bags and struck mr baadjies in the face with his fist .
madam speaker , in his opening address , the hon premier said that we should look at the development of the rural areas , at urbanisation among other things , with the aim of counteracting the associated social problems .
he omits to mention that his colleague in the cabinet has said that what the hon premier spoke about here is a fallacy , and that the powers already exist in the constitution .
being the last speaker , and knowing that the house has heard 40-odd people speak , i am absolutely certain that nobody really and truly needs or wants to hear me .
we have , the 42 of us and the officials , been engaged , at tremendous expense , in debating various issues , and we have achieved absolutely nothing , in my view , for the people out there .
i would like to be judged on my competence , and that of the cabinet , not by the " african negative party " in this chamber , but rather by the public at large .
mr speaker , it must be acknowledged that fully 90 % of the entire budget , inclusive of housing , is dedicated to the delivery of socio-economic services , with the main beneficiaries being middle and lower-income earners .
i should inform this parliament that it is the intention of the national government that future salary and wage negotiations should be a trade-off between the number of personnel in employment versus actual salary increases .
not only has this budget been structured in terms of the new public finance management act , but we are implementing the provisions of that act by training and capacity-building in the treasury and other provincial departments .
as i have said the revenue from betting and racing in the finance vote have been reduced over the mtef period due to the advent of casinos and lower expected tax revenue from betting .
mr speaker , one provincial administration took responsibility not only for the western cape as it is today ; it also took responsibility for the eastern cape and the northern cape in one cape province .
hon members would not have heard the word out of the hon member mr ozinsky 's mouth today , because they preach it but they actually do not practise it .
mr speaker , this pattern is nothing new in africa or indeed anywhere that powerful elites are allowed to prosper without opposition to check their worst instincts .
mr speaker , what makes the anc 's race-tinted protestations on behalf of the poor even more reprehensible is that they are grounded on a bed of hypocrisy and veiled in a cloak of untruths .
that is why i want to focus my speech today - coming from the perspective of a businessman - on the fact that one has to generate revenue to be able to make a province work .
then we need to support such an inquiry , and request the business schools of the universities of cape town , the western cape and stellenbosch to see how the province can be pioneering in the generation of revenue .
simply by virtue of the mtef having begun to show its benefits , the anc has seen a budget that is more predictable and therefore ought to be supported in its macro details .
the delay from 6 december to now - early march - is not , in my view , excessive if one takes into consideration the delay in taking it along the tender board route .
in general , our nine policy objectives have been grasped by all in the public service , business , the media and by the public with enthusiasm , and , might i say , even by a few hon members in the opposition benches .
as public representatives we not only have to act responsibly , to be transparent , accountable , dignified and correct , we have to set the example to the youth and our communities out there , which is very important .
if the hon members on that side of the house are saying that it is in order to lie , i have to tell them that it is not in order for me .
in this regard i must inform hon members that the cabinet has accepted as policy that as far as its staff and related affairs are concerned , the province will continue to function as a unit .
some of the other provinces that some years ago decentralised all their auxiliary services are today plucking the bitter fruits of this irresponsible behaviour in that some indispensable services have simply collapsed .
disciplinary action involved the following : a syndicate consisting of 13 officials and two persons outside the province was uncovered during an investigation conducted with the assistance of the narcotics bureau of the saps .
secondly , it latches onto one demographic criterion , race , and ignores others , such as levels of urbanisation , and the age profiles of the population , in deciding what the composition of an institution should be .
the hon member mr strachan approached all the departments and it does seem from his findings that there is not a strategy for good communication between the different departments and their various sections .
the only thing about these gender issues , if one talks about employment only , is that they refer to it as though one wants to say how many are employed and how many are in the department .
regarding gender , i fully agree with the hon member that the rate of violence against women - even rape of our young girls and boys in this province - is appalling .
] you will remember - this refrain has been going on since 15 february and continued last week as well - that you were the only one in the scof meeting who came up with a sensible question .
i want to thank the hon member mr silke for his support of this budget vote and particularly for the understanding he displayed of the problems we are experiencing in acquiring professional legal staff .
] we can look at ways and means of parliamentary participation , as we agreed to at that meeting of scof last week , and obviously it will only be where we can get mutual benefit out of those agreements .
the hon minister in the office of the premier indicated during the debate that there was , in fact , a plan and that people who said that there was no plan were liars .
the committee wishes to encourage the department to improve the overall business management of health and to ensure stronger emphasis of its resources to the private sector to generate own income .
i must remind him of the promise that the speaker , on behalf of the committee on rules and internal arrangements can approach him during the year for possible extra funding in the adjustments appropriation bill .
these are two aspects about which , i would concede , we did not do enough in the past , but i was misled by the surpluses which arose every year thanks to the thrift of members .
the public finance management act , 1999 ( act 29 of 1999 ) comes into operation on 1 april 2000 and that in itself will bring additional responsibilities and functions to our staff .
hon members will have noticed that we have introduced certain changes in respect of hansard which we believe have made a marked difference to the quality and speed of service .
standing committees now have access to money to expand their activities , and i would earnestly appeal to committees to extend their activities to towns and centres outside cape town .
people always say that one gets better with experience and practice , but it is from sitting and listening to us that the speaker has developed such finesse in his speeches .
i likewise thank the speaker and his staff for producing for the first time a budget that we feel content with and that will enable us to produce good service .
in the final analysis i cannot allow the majority on the committee on rules and internal arrangements simply to decide that they are going to capacitate certain members of the house and not others .
the national minister of housing must , in accordance with the provisions of the housing act , act 107 of 1997 , agree on a period within which provincial housing development board properties will be made available to local authorities for housing development .
if that hon member knows of land which , in his considered opinion and according to technical knowledge which he may possess , is suitable for housing , he is free to put that information forward .
mr speaker , since the hon minister of transport and works has been visiting the disaster areas and the hon member ms essop is also not in the house , we request that the question stand over .
mr speaker , i would like to make it clear to the hon minister of finance and development planning that it is disappointing that he once again comes to the house with less than factual information .
( 2 ) the premier shall cause a copy of the report submitted to him or her in terms of subsection ( 1 ) to be tabled as soon as may be practicable in the provincial legislature .
mr speaker , firstly it would have been the correct procedure if the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism had notified the questioner in time that he would not be present .
indeed , they have been invited to the world of children 's choirs in march 2001 where they are one of four out of a group of 50 choirs that will act there as host choir .
mr speaker , i should like to ask the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation , if he says that today , what he said to the newspapers when they carried the report .
this clearance is the same as that for permanent members of the saps as well as 99 % of officials in the service of parliament and the administrative services .
the people whom the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation and others have sent for training are now being used for duties which are not what the sponsors are paying them for .
we could have chosen to employ 215 health workers , who are sorely needed in the delft 24-hour emergency clinic which could not be opened a few years ago because of staff shortages .
yet , we choose to create a window-dressing echelon , costing taxpayers r14 million , and then have the nerve to tell taxpayers out there that it is to enhance service delivery .
in order to be prepared for any further disruption , the hon minister of transport , sport and recreation declared two further areas affected areas in terms of section 30a of the above-mentioned act .
the hon minister of transport , sport and recreation , who is not here - he told me he would be attending a minmec meeting - has been saying that he was doing it his way .
in the light of bonteheuwel being on the list for the construction of a police station , whether he will in the interim consider placing a satellite police station in bonteheuwel because of the high crime rate ?
the chapter in the act dealing with the establishment and functioning of the planning review board is one of the most critical elements of this law and must be implemented within the next six months .
is the hon minister of local government and development planning going to continue with the approach of the former minister of finance and development planning and ignore legal issues until they prevent the implementation of regulations ?
mr speaker , i would like to know from the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works whether he has taken any action against the person concerned who is discriminating against the black workers at elsenburg .
lately , in this year , i have again written letters and put a formal question to the hon minister , asking whether there have there been measures to make sure that the corruption practices are eliminated .
this preferential procurement policy is also limited to the application of a preference points system whereby points are allocated for price and pro rata points per percentage of equity owned by historically disadvantaged individuals in businesses .
a person with a disability has a long-term or permanent impairment or recurring condition or health problem , which needs to be reasonably accommodated on the job and calls for the elimination of barriers in the workplace .
( 2 ) whether the provincial aids council has been established ; if not , ( a ) why not and ( b ) when will it be established ; if so , what are the details of its programme ?
whether any consultants were appointed to advise him on the restructuring of the chief directorate : business promotion and tourism ; if so , ( a ) on what terms and conditions and ( b ) what were the objectives ?
except , of course , taking into account that if students have previously moved into lower grades on the basis of fraudulent reports , then that impact may well still be felt in the matriculation examination quite significantly .
that is part of the transformation we are going through , and i assure him that this coalition government has the will , the political will , and its nine policy objectives to serve the people of this province .
i merely mention canal walk , grandwest , spier , extensions at the airport , as well as significant progress in regard to the convention centre , and new development at the v & a waterfront , including the roggebaai canal .
as the hon leader of the opposition has explained the actions he will take in regard to this matter , i will also allow other hon members , if any , to address me briefly on it .
what i can say is that in terms of section 10g of the local government transition act , 1993 ( act 209 of 1993 ) , they have the power to levy taxes on immovable property .
a task team and a reference group consisting of officials and knowledgeable persons in the various disciplines of property management from the private sector will be appointed to assist with the task - and obviously the public sector as well .
i was told that the hon minister of transport and works is aware of the concept involved , so that we can actually give the police more powers to act .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon premier whether he could inform the house of the progress made with regard to the advisory panel on the western cape honours act .
it has , among others , participated in the national sectoral workgroups on education , health and welfare , the national procurement forum , workshops on the public finance management act and the infrastructural review and health 4x4 teams .
according to a statistic presented to me , this province already has a group of some 2,5 % of its population who are regarded as problem gamblers and this is before the advent of casinos .
it is our responsibility to break down the most important barrier of division remaining and to create a province in which there will not be very poor blacks , poor coloureds and unfairly enriched whites , but only south africans .
it is the duty and responsibility of this government to realise the aspirations of coloureds and blacks who , for a long time , were not accorded recognition , especially within the management cadre .
we were given assurances in this house by the then minister of finance and agricultural affairs that by 1999 the pawc would be truly representative of all the people of the western cape , including the disabled .
we stand full square behind a transparent process in which there are no conflicts of interest and the adjudicating authorities are fully representative of the empowerment policies that we profess to want to implement .
madam chairperson , i prepared a speech on finance , but , to be honest , i must first say that i believe that i have reached the lowest ebb of my six-year political career today .
let me just say to the hon member mr louis , who mentioned that the motion had not been supported here , that i think he should have a drink of water and cool down .
in this debate we were surprised to see the hon premier and the deputy premier , the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism , responding negatively to our constructive approach to this budget .
] they are gone from the political scene here and forgotten , with the position they took and their blaming game when it came to the budget and what the budget process meant .
we have heard a lot of rumours that what is already happening is that people from within sun west are now buying out companies that they know will be supplying goods to sun west in the future .
i want to say to you , madam chairperson - i have said this on many occasions before - that i have the utmost faith in the chairperson and each and every member of the gambling board .
has called for immediate measures and a national debate to tackle what he threatened was " a ticking time bomb " of joblessness and the prospect of social instability .
as a result of this crisis the cries for a " zero tolerance " approach have increasingly been heard - from the public and politicians alike , together with an alarming number of cases of brutal community justice that are being reported .
however , this immediate shortfall in personnel of 3 067 members to the current 12 000 posts is misleading , as the ideal personnel strength for the western cape is calculated at 21 723 for the year 2000 .
madam chairperson , it is therefore an intervention that is proactive , aimed at long-term benefits to providing a learning and personal growth opportunity to young south africans who would otherwise never have had that chance .
the high level of gang-related violence in the manenberg area could be attributed to the fact that a large majority of adults and youths , including those of school-going age , are idle at home .
all i want to say is that i think it is time for these law enforcement agencies to meet and come under a unified command ; and not each have its own story - " law enforcement ?
at the time of the 1999 election the new np made big promises with slogans such as " keep the cape nat " , " hang murderers and rapists " , " quality education " , to mention only a few .
in south africa there are some 11 000 saps members who do not have driver 's licences , and whilst many officers are poorly trained , more than 40 000 members of the saps have grade 10 or lower .
if the hon minister achieves success with the objectives he has set himself in regard to the parents , he and his department as well as the community , the province and south africa will reap the fruits of that .
the racist remarks made by the hon member mr byneveldt with regard to the selective identification of police officials and referring to them by name , all of whom significantly happened to be white , ...
this includes making teams representative , equity of resources and facilities and addressing socio-economic problems through sport and getting children off the streets .
bafana bafana excelled in the recent african cup of nations tournament in ghana , the proteas are making history in india and our very own stormers are showing their mettle in the super 12 competition .
indeed , we are facing a significant few days with the visit of the fifa delegation to our shores to look at our technical readiness to host the biggest showpiece of soccer , the world cup .
as a first step he should instruct the national minister of safety and security to put a sting in the tail of the scorpions and jack up all his other policing agencies .
the purpose was to empower all educators , pupils and parents with an understanding of the scope of work they need to cover every week during grade 12 to complete the matric syllabus .
by october the demands on the safe schools programme , as a result of its success , had grown so substantially that we allocated an additional r5 million for infrastructural and development support to an additional 52 schools .
mr chairperson , we have a team of 60 people under the able leadership of mr viv viviers undertaking the training of school governing bodies and management teams in administration and financial management .
we hope we will retain the very best personnel in our system , because we cannot maintain quality with cuts of this magnitude without dramatically increasing productivity and improving management systems .
i also wish to thank the committee coordinator , ms joy rorke , and the researcher , ms lynn saayman , for their contributions in making a success of the activities of the standing committee .
it is also envisaged that such programmes be offered to parents , since it has been found that the lack of life skills in the family is in the majority of cases the cause of the unacceptable behaviour of pupils .
we are all aware that the new model will be far more effective and economical than the old , and that it will make a major contribution towards combating crime and violence in the province .
in characterising educational change processes , one can focus on a number of different issues : the pace of change , the complexity of change and the fact that educational change needs to be systemic more than anything else .
as the hon minister mentioned today , although matric results , on their own , are an inadequate indicator of the quality of education , they are among the few benchmarks we have to measure the system .
a further example of the lack of facilities is the rietvlei school between mossel bay and albertinia where teachers have to bring drinking water to school in containers and the children use the fields as toilets .
in a very good article argued by michael kahn in the sunday times , he said that there was still time to avoid becoming spectators to the new millennium .
it is not often that i say that i agree with much of what the hon member mr gabru says , but this time i am pleased to be able to say so .
i can , however , not agree with the hon member mr gabru when he says that we must get consensus of all role-players when we suspect that profound maladministration , mismanagement and possibly corruption have taken place .
when we went back we found that much of the faulty data had its origin either in the national register of school needs , or in the data that schools , often in good faith , had supplied to us .
- the trading account implemented at the karl bremer hospital will be evaluated with a view to the extension of further pilots to the vredenburg hospital and the pharmaceutical stores at both academic hospitals .
we shall achieve this by way of concrete intervention aimed at upgrading health facilities to such an extent that communities , patients and staff will again be proud to visit our institutions .
we all know about the signing of the agreements for the opening of the new medical centre of the university of cape town , and we have advertised for a similar venture at the tygerberg hospital .
madam chairperson , i began by sharing with hon members my optimism for the future and how , together with the branch : health , we will turn our common vision for health services into reality .
this needs to be addressed , given that the nurses are the backbone of the health care system , and especially given that the effect this has had on the quality of care is enormous .
dr rahman of tygerberg hospital stated in an interview given to tygertalk in november that rigid controls of the expenditure of the hospital in terms of medicine , bandages and other needs had been put in place .
regarding the raising of own revenue , over the past few years we have witnessed a decline in this department 's ability to raise its own revenue in terms of hospital receipts , or hospital fees .
secondary beds and primary health care centres should be made an integral part of academic hospital complexes , thereby making patient channelling an administrative tool , not playing god with people 's lives .
i do not have a fancy mnemonic based on the word " spend " to aid our memory , but basically it is a question of how we spend our money .
we really need to obtain some idea of whether the hon minister is aware of the deficit of r60 million , whether he was dishonest with us and what the plan is to defray it .
now , the first time that he has had any interaction with health issues at this level he comes in here as the former minister and tries to be a big timer in respect of health .
her comment when she rose was that as a health reporter it was possible to be on the front page of the newspaper every day as a result of all the tragedies that occur , particularly in the sphere of public health .
if the hon member gives me the information about the late the abraham fortune , i should very much like to have the matter fully investigated and report in detail to him and to the house , if they require that .
report of the auditor-general on the financial statements of vote 3 - housing , local government and planning of the provincial administration : western cape for the year ended 31 march 1998 [ pr 11 / 2000 ] .
this is a phrase which i coined at the bosberaad at the end of august 1999 and which was advocated by my staff in their respective business plans for the other desks .
it will also be expected of the consultant to develop his findings into strategies to enable the western cape government to assess what it has achieved in the field of poverty relief .
with the launch of the interministerial committee on hiv / aids , chaired by the hon acting minister of social services , the commitment and cooperation of all hon ministers and provincial departments have been obtained .
mr chairperson , i have come into contact with people who have told me about institutions where these incidents are occurring , but they refuse to write letters or make an affidavit confirming these incidents .
mr chairperson , i am sure there are thousands of people in the province who would like to adopt children , but sometimes the processes and the red tape that people have to go through puts them off completely .
that has been the most eloquent reply to those who insist that affirmative action , giving people of colour a chance and welding together a new leadership is , ipso facto , a lowering of standards .
i have travelled far and wide into the rural areas and i have discovered numerous issues in that regard that concern me , but i will leave that for a later debate .
madam chairperson , i think you and hon members will agree that the critics who accuse the western cape of not performing should look at the statistics , or for ever hold their peace .
the department of housing has embarked on a number of initiatives to ensure a proactive approach to housing development in the province , as opposed to the first come first served method adopted in previous years .
for some time now i have been emphasising the need for capacity building of home-owners to be an absolute priority at local government level , with basic training such as budgeting and maintenance being provided to potential beneficiaries .
i would therefore like to appeal to beneficiaries to approach the local authorities and make arrangements to pay off any arrears that might have accrued before it is too late .
the point i would like to emphasise is that even though these are informal settlements , we should formalise and plan to a certain extent to make the lives of the residents within these communities a little more bearable .
madam chairperson , allow me the opportunity to thank the hon minister of housing and his department for the work that they have done and for the achievements that he mentioned in his budget speech .
i would like to invite the hon minister to come and see these projects for himself , so that he realises that developer-driven projects are not the answer to the housing crisis and are not acceptable .
the hon minster must please inform that hon member that not one half cent of the millions of rand that he has mentioned in connection with cmip comes from him or his department .
the department of local government and the hon minister must really put mechanisms in place which truly support people , particularly in dealing with financial management , because that is where the problems usually arise .
i would like to join the hon minister of local government in thanking all those officials and councillors from negotiating forums at local and provincial government level for bringing us to this point .
why can afrikaner business people praise thabo mbeki and say that they want to cooperate , while there is a small group in the new np saying that they as afrikaner politicians cannot cooperate with the anc .
i can assure hon members that i have many more statistics available today than he has , statistics that i can roll out on the table in order to tell hon members what is really happening at certain municipalities .
what we are not sure of is whether such land reforms will be introduced in terms of the white paper on land reform of the national department of land affairs , or whether land reform could also take place in terms of an own western cape policy .
at some point , we need an explanation of why the cabinet took a decision which was not only unpopular in the south peninsula , but would have led to a major environmental disaster .
mr chairperson , it gives me great pleasure to enter this debate today on behalf of my colleague , the hon member mr silke who , due to unforeseen circumstances , cannot be here today .
while on the subject of structure plans or guide plans , i would like to know from the hon minister and his department the number of plans in progress and the number that have been completed , but are awaiting final approval .
finally , madam , on behalf of the new np i wish to extend my sincere thanks to the hon minister and all his officials for the major role they are playing to stabilise the situation in regard to development in the western cape .
madam chairperson , i think i will skip the pleasantries and get straight into the issues in the department of planning , local government and housing that i would like to address in my speech today .
the hon member mr isaacs has left , but let me still say it is the first time i have heard him praising national legislation above provincial legislation and i thank him for that .
i want to point out that we are directly involved through the processes of the integrated planning frameworks , workshops , providing financial support , and drafting and distributing a manual on integrated planning frameworks .
one will commence on 22 march , during national water week , when we shall be going to the bongani camp in khayelitsha to assist the community with cleaning up the kuils river and the surrounding wetland .
this unit has to look at the impact of various activities on the environment - not only in terms of conservation , but also in terms of pollution , waste management , aesthetics , visual impact and so forth .
finally , madam chairperson , i want to deal with an issue that cuts across all the portfolios and all the budgets , and affects us all directly and indirectly , and that is hiv / aids .
when i asked him last week about the commission of inquiry into the fires that ravaged the peninsula - a major environmental issue in the province - he said : " i do not know .
allow me firstly to thank the hon minister of housing who yesterday underlined his initiative to address the needs of aids victims within existing policies in his department .
madam chairperson , let me start by adding my voice to that of the hon member mr a j williams in wishing the head of this department , dr kane-berman , a hearty retirement .
( 3 ) further commits itself to address all forms of racism and that the current coalition government also commits itself to ensure that by no later than june 2000 :
therefore , we would like to demonstrate to the house what we have already achieved and what we intend to achieve and the route that we will follow in promoting development in the western cape .
the increases should not affect private motor car owners significantly , but heavy vehicles which do the most damage to the roads will be expected to bear the brunt of these increases .
it is good to hear that the grand parade building is now nearing completion for rental , and to hear of the numerous projects of schools and hospitals that this department is providing .
we wonder why the western cape government does not see the public works programme as an integrated priority in the poverty eradication programme , where money is voted to public sector infrastructure creation and job creation schemes .
therefore , we call for the transfer of the r10 million for poverty alleviation to the department of the hon minister of transport and works in order to deal with poverty alleviation as an integrated public works programme .
the president must either assent to and sign a bill passed in terms of this chapter or , if the president has reservations about the constitutionality of the bill , refer it back to the national assembly for reconsideration .
i hope that capetonians who currently commute on these congested routes under very trying circumstances manage to keep their cool , as we cannot afford any more road-rage fatalities in this province .
it is no great honour for the hon minister to have received money from the casino bid , because it was a promise given to this ministry that they would get those moneys .
some of our roads are in a state of disrepair because they have not been resurfaced for the past 20 years and more - and some of them will have to be redone .
the hon member mr ismail also referred to the r428 million on the budget of this department as well as the backlog of r700 million in regard to the maintenance of roads .
the reason they record an objection could of course be anything - they might not have heard the motion clearly , the motion may not be clear or they may not agree with its contents .
consultation with important role-players continues and we are moving away from the prescriptive approach of the existing tourism legislation to an approach that relies on the principles of cooperative governance contained in the constitution .
we must move towards a situation in which we regard our buildings as defined-cost centres , and compare the benefits we derive with the cost that we incur , and decide whether it is worthwhile .
madam chairperson , i would like to inform the house that the bill as it stands envisages the creation of a consumer protector that will consider complaints received from consumers and from consumer advisers ...
madam chairperson , a very handy source document will be found at the back of the handbook which contains names and telephone numbers of business advice centres , district councils that deal with this , and financial institutions from which funds are available .
" for people who depend on our services , it is critical that these services are seen to be happening , and the hon members should keep the minister accountable that they are actually happening .
the department of health granted a hospital licence to uct medical centre ( pty ) ltd to operate a private hospital in vacant space situated in block d of the groote schuur hospital .
the hon minister has an outstanding management team in his department and he has clearly succeeded in ensuring that the business sector in the western cape can look to the future with trust and optimism .
madam chairperson , the constant reference from the hon premier 's department to the knowledge economy without any content , demonstrates in that office an economy of knowledge , rather than any detailed understanding of this western cape economy .
it is perhaps symptomatic that actually it is the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism who provides leadership to the coalition government , and it is very sad that all the rest of the cabinet have to leave .
madam chairperson , it is interesting that the hon minister does not in any formal sense speak about the initiatives that he has taken on the impact of the sadc , eu and wto trade negotiations and agreements .
while mentioning tourism i would , in his absence , like to congratulate dr fabricius , and the tourism sector of the department on their outstanding one-week course they presented at stellenbosch university .
madam chairperson , these are medium and long-term solutions , and while this is taking place the people of the province , like annie in knysna , and the many other annies in every residential settlement across the cape , are suffering .
it is pure wishful thinking on anyone 's part to think that the vested interests in the tourism industry will welcome competition and other people if there are no regulations that compel them to do so .
anyone who has taken the time to talk to people in the tobacco industry and listen to them will appreciate that it is not possible to achieve this limit within two years .
we are very pleased to hear about the success achieved with the projects for the establishment of new farmers at nelspoort , the land utilisation plan at elandskloof and the irrigation system in brandwacht and friemersheim .
madam chairperson , i would like to thank the members of the standing committee for their commitment and for supporting me this last year and i look forward to their continued commitment in the year ahead .
madam chairperson , the anc wishes to recognise the initiatives launched by local people , be they farmer or worker , municipal authorities and the private sector , who are prepared to encourage activities in the agricultural sector .
the discrepancy in marking it " paraffin " and not " diesel " can only be constructed as having a tax implication and has nothing to do with the practicality of marking diesel .
( 2 ) calls on the premier to finalise this matter as speedily as possible and recover any monies due to the province as a result of this matter .
as a first step he should instruct the national minister of safety and security to put a sting in the tail of the scorpions and jack up all his other policing agencies .
mr speaker , the provincial parliament is called upon today to amend the road transportation act , 1977 ( act 74 of 1977 ) as a measure to deal with public transport operators ' problems .
the amendment of road transport legislation , which provides for certain measures , has been done elsewhere , in kwazulu-natal and gauteng , as i have indicated , and we do not oppose the process of amending this legislation here .
mr speaker , with this amendment to the legislation , once passed by this parliament , the hon minister will have the power to act when this thuggery raises its ugly head .
mr speaker , we support the western cape road transportation act amendment bill , but my concern is that we are late in dealing with this situation and are crisis-orientated .
thirdly , mr speaker , why has this province failed to take a firm grip on the legalisation process which is the issue that lies at the heart of the present problem ?
is it justifiable for a bill of this nature to be considered here today ?
but really , and i say this here in public , if the violence and the situation at grassroots level do not improve then i shall be compelled to close areas - routes , areas or taxi ranks .
the np , new or not new - smart suits , ties , hats , or whatever - and whether one shouts np or new np , has a problem .
it is pointless complaining in the highest decision-making chamber about the suffering of people if we do not consider realistically what can be done to address the problem .
if after the conclusion of this debate we walk out of parliament as people who are more sensitive to what is happening out there then i believe that a great deal has already been achieved with this request for a debate .
we apply it as it suits us - when i do so , it is all very well , but when someone else does the same , it is unacceptable ; we whose specific task it is to establish and try to guarantee the human rights culture .
the only things that were good in the past were because he , the hon member mr marais and others received money for their participation in the house of representatives in the tricameral parliament ...
according to the national minister of finance the police budget will be increased by 7 % to 8 % plus an additional amount of r1,1 billion spread over two financial years which will be allocated .
as hon members well know , at the beginning of june we will start training young men to try to deter them from going into gangster activities .
rulings by the speaker , deputy speaker or any presiding officer may not be criticised without a motion being introduced or a point of order raised , in which a better ruling can be called for .
hon members will note that what appeared before the house today does correspond in regard to the recent executions , but it is wider and in this request it also has to do with arms control .
as the chairperson of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling he in fact , shows a lack of information and knowledge about matters of finance , and even his knowledge about the western cape exchequer law can be seriously questioned .
] in none of the evidence - i will get to how the evidence was presented - presented to us in the committee meeting yesterday was it indicated that we should pay those volunteers .
once they had lost the court case at the beginning of march , they then hurriedly moved into gear to deal with the voter registration , because they knew that their voters were no longer registered .
] this process thus added significantly to the number of citizens on the voters ' roll , which no doubt contributed to the strengthening of our new democracy as provided for in the bill of rights .
i would like to say to the hon leader of the house that i have allowed two speakers from the new np and one speaker from the anc to address me on this issue .
i now give the ruling that if every answer is , " i do not know , " that will simply be accepted as the answer , so that we can get through this committee stage , which is the second process .
to answer the hon member : no houses should have been built from this money and it has absolutely nothing to do with building houses , so the hon member 's question falls away .
it is true that agriculture will never have enough money but agriculture also accepts its responsibility for our having to get our voters registered , particularly in the rural areas , and for the fact that that is their democratic right .
in the same way that i have asked people not to respond when he refers to the hon minister of finance and development , i am going to ask him not to respond now .
madam chairperson , can i take it from that that members of the premier 's department assisted and were paid in the registration process , and where were they deployed to in assisting with the registration process ?
the hon minister of education is correct , voter registration took place before the election and it is also correct that the hon minister was not in office , but we are dealing with the 1999-2000 financial year .
did the hon minister ask that question and , if she did not , can we assume correctly that she did not apply her mind to the way in which she voted today ?
if members on the other side of the house are actually looking at who takes teachers out of the classrooms more than anyone else , it is the south african democratic teachers union - the coalition partner of the anc .
would the hon minister not have thought it perhaps wiser to understand why her colleague the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism has made no savings in his vote ?
madam chairperson , could the hon minister of transport and works indicate to the house whether he was also given the agreement by the provincial treasury that he will be reimbursed with r36 000 ?
if the anc had objected , they should have drawn your attention immediately to the fact that they preferred the third reading not to be dealt with and did not wish you to put the question .
it is true that the anc had a variety of very interesting strategies and they tried very hard to break up the coalition government , but the point is they failed .
what we find is that the key control of the two or three most important gangs and gang syndicates are based there and they are increasingly using areas such as muizenberg and sea point as battlegrounds for their influence .
the status of " most dangerous province " was achieved in the period of office of the hon premier and in the time of the nnp / dp coalition or under da control - whatever hon members want to call it .
we should remember - and the voters of the western cape should take note - that not a single da council has delivered on an election promise that they copied from the anc .
] we will be hearing a lot of this issue in the weeks ahead and the truth will out , however much the anc 's spin doctors , representatives and thugs in crossroads seek to bury it .
i am not sure what all the other hon members of the house did during their recess , but i spent my time filling in voting cards at engen service stations around the province .
particularly disturbing in this shocking incident was the fact that neither the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works nor his office publicly condemned the farmer in question and others concerned .
the drop of 16c per litre that takes place today is a relief but the introduction of a rebate that will make a real difference in reducing input costs is something we desperately need .
in conclusion , mr speaker , i would like to also congratulate the hon minister of health and the department for the consistent and persistent effort to manage and control this threat to our existence .
even in debate , if somebody points out that something is wrong , the chairperson of that specific committee should respond to that and that should be the report to stand before the house at that stage .
madam chairperson , unfortunately i am unable to answer that question , but i certainly will be able to advise the hon member mr strachan of the answer in writing .
i do not wish to detract from the coalition , but i do feel that if members of the coalition decided to travel by bus one morning , they could also have told us about that .
by forcing golden arrow out of the area the taxis will be able to prove a need , and that is why they will be able to get a licence .
their absenteeism rate has gone up by 100 % , and the escalation of their people resigning , being injured and losing their lives has been such that golden arrow are really tremendously concerned .
that solution to the issues that have been identified has to be the following : the issue of the permits should be fast-tracked and the operators who have fallen out of the system should be accepted in the system .
this action takes away people 's freedom of choice ; it destroys what rule of law there may be ; it threatens the right to life ; and , in fact , it undermines the basis of our democracy and our constitution .
the question that should be asked is why the anc did not lead that march to the central parliament and ask them why they were not enforcing the law .
mr speaker , we hope that the inertia that has governed the way in which this province has handled this issue will now come to an end. i hope that the underlying causes are dealt with .
i will give my final ruling on this , and in future we can deal with it - whether there are notices of motion printed on the order paper or not - in a particular manner .
( 2 ) conditions in pma are similar to those of notorious concentration camps , with severe overcrowding , a serious lack of basic facilities and amenities , especially toilet and washing facilities , beds , bedding , blankets , clean clothes , shoes , etc ;
the object of the cape town international convention centre company bill , as outlined , is therefore to make provision for the ownership by the province of shares in the private company , which is a company funded by share capital with limited liability .
to put that in perspective , last weekend we had the comrades marathon , which was hosted partly at the durban convention centre , but it was really a durban city-wide event .
secondly , not only is the mice tourism demand outstripping the growth of leisure tourism , the profile shows a shift towards australia-pacific countries and africa .
the aggregate spending from foreign tourists contributes close to 60 % of overall tourist spending in the province , compared to just over 40 % from domestic tourism , even though the latter shows far larger numbers .
this is evidence that an increasing trust and synergy is developing between the provincial government and the metropolitan government , on the one hand , and the private sector on the other .
when we deal with legislation , be it the convention centre legislation or any other legislation , it is our responsibility and obligation to apply our minds and be as rigorously informed on the issues at hand as possible .
by sitting on the board of the convention centre the hon ministers of economic affairs and tourism and of finance and development planning will once again talk empowerment , but who will be empowered in the province ?
the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism therefore does not accept the second amendment , the insertion into subsection ( 2 ) renumbered as subsection ( 3 ) which reads as follows :
clause 5 ( 2 ) is therefore linked - and i am not sure how we are going to vote on this - to what happened in relation to the rewording of the text before us .
it is tabled by the relevant minister and it can then be referred to the standing committee .
however , mr speaker , what is important is that the hon minister of local government knew about certain matters at the outset , and so did the anc in the standing committee meetings .
mr speaker , it is very strange to hear the new np speaking about collective leadership now , how suddenly they have become adherents of that , after they walked out of the government of national unity .
we in the anc believe implicitly in the judiciary as an institution of government and we believe that the ideas and values of a substantially and substantively independent judiciary should not be compromised .
mr speaker , furthermore the notion of a substantive independent judiciary in the apartheid era is a fallacy , and i think that is the notion on which this motion that has been put before the house is based .
anybody who has read a little political science will know that in strong democratic countries the principle of the separation of powers , the trias politica , is the absolute cornerstone for maintaining those democratic principles .
when such a remark comes from a senior civil servant , especially one that was a former anc politician , it does not help in maintaining the independence of the judiciary in the public eye .
i genuinely believe that we have a positive role to play in building up the judiciary and the independence of the judiciary , and not regaling the house with many of the negative and ...
the white voters are already shifting to the dp , whereas it was the coloured voters who were largely responsible for the new np still being a political factor in the western cape , and in the country .
its attempts to do so have resulted in the dp at the national level becoming the official opposition and the anc in the western cape becoming the largest party in the province .
it is very clear that according to hansard , where the hon member mr isaacs used the words " a disgraceful lie " , that is not a problem because he referred to something .
a woman 's small and medium enterprise business , called small medium enterprises on the move , which is a consortium of small and medium enterprise business people coordinating to cover overhead costs , could not get access to finance .
these then - also in the construction industry , which the hon member mr ramatlakane will refer to - charge their joint venture partner management or administrative fees in order to access loans for them .
the anc and its alliance partners in cosatu and the sacp seem to feel that economic growth will happen without government creating the right conditions , but economic reality tells us otherwise .
in probing this one will find , for example , in regard to panel-beating shops that up until two or three years ago major insurance companies did not have many black panel-beaters listed on their panel of approved panel-beaters .
special report of the auditor-general on the outstanding financial statements in respect of local governments in the province of the western cape as at 30 september 1999 and 31 december 1999 [ pr 34 / 2000 ] ; and
that the house congratulates the national rugby and cricket teams on winning their respective matches against new zealand and australia , and expresses the hope that these performances will be repeated in their forthcoming matches in durban and new zealand .
it must also be possible to implement that clause where proper phasing-in can take place and , if necessary - i do not say in all cases - it must also be applicable to a period of six years .
the minister can in future intervene in certain aspects which fall under the municipality and in the past were never matters for the minister , and he can make certain provisions in that regard .
i would really not like us to bring the house into disrepute , whether it is by hand signals , the words hon members use , or the kinds of interjections that are made .
the stability we must ensure for local government is that people pay for the services supplied to them - in the first place there are the rates and secondly there are the services .
in terms of sections 25 ( 4 ) ( a ) and 25 ( 5 ) of the pfma , i hereby report the following authorisation for tabling in the provincial parliament and the making public thereof :
( 3 ) appeals to the saps , the provincial commissioner and especially the minister of community safety to do everything in their power to apprehend the culprits ;
( 1 ) commends the decision by the department of health to roll out their programme to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hiv / aids to six focus areas ; and
4.2 the rationale behind the amendment is that the board , which receives certain of these fees for its own account , such as new licence application fees and annual investigation fees , is liable and registered for vat .
mr speaker , this is an industry which can spawn a high degree of illegal operators , and any failure to comply with the law must be stamped out at its root .
the personal or private financial or business interest of a member includes any financial or business interest which , to the member 's knowledge , the member 's spouse , permanent companion or family member has .
mr speaker , the cabinet had full knowledge of my so-called interests and there was therefore no risk of my exposing myself to any situation involving a conflict of interest .
i will move on at the end of my political career , not to my former business offices but , please god , to the back porch , with my feet up and a good book to read .
in terms of sections 25 ( 4 ) ( a ) and 25 ( 5 ) of the pfma , i hereby report the following authorisation for tabling in the provincial parliament and the making public thereof :
" because apartheid is dead and because democracy is a minor child , the judge finds that the prosecutor , the community and the defence , the state , must be charged and must take their place in the dock .
what one is seeing in south african society today is the result of a deep-seated feeling in members of the public that the perpetrators of injustice are , in fact , not being made subject to justice .
the police 's special task team , and there is only one of this type in the country trained to deal with high-risk situations such as urban terror , and similar to the uk 's sas unit , and
let me just warn against the temptation which all leaders and public representatives face at a time like this , to make ever more radical pronouncements with every bomb that explodes .
( 3 ) further commits itself to address all forms of racism and that the current coalition government also commits itself to ensure that by no later than june 2000 :
they are a waste of taxpayers ' money and , in fact , all they do is sit there , have lunch , pack padkos and drive off in their class c mercedes benzes .
and i could go on dissecting their representation , race group by race group , but that would fall into their trap of seeing the world in racial compartments and judging each individual accordingly .
the hon ministers who are in the house today and the former ministers who may be present may take the view that appointments in the administration are not or were not their responsibilities .
such a superimposition of merit as the yardstick for everything can have no other intention than the active preservation of white privilege on the one hand and largely black poverty on the other .
in fact , what dene smuts did was to open the eyes of that entire conference to the fact that there were whites who were willing to make a break with the past .
it is one of the most insulting ironies of our times that by their definition i am now not regarded as a black person because it is not convenient for them to do so .
we have already heard from the hon minister of social services and from the hon minister of education that the anc , who claim to be representative of their supporters , have a coloured leader ; ...
mr speaker , on a point of order : could i ask the hon premier to withdraw the repeated usage of the word " motjie " in reference to the hon member ms essop .
that the house , noting that the provincial cabinet will be visiting the overberg region on 18 and 19 october 2000 , calls on the cabinet to pay special attention to -
nothing of course prohibits any member in the future from putting it on the order paper as a motion , and if that member does not withdraw it , the house must express itself on that motion .
in terms of sections 25 ( 4 ) ( a ) and 25 ( 5 ) of the pfma , i hereby report the following authorisation for tabling in the provincial parliament and the making public thereof :
it was also noted that the tender board , on the grounds that the nature of the expenditure was not an emergency or in the best interests of the province , refused an application for ex post facto authority .
report of the standing committee on health , social services , office of the premier and corporate services , on the national health laboratory service bill [ b52-2000 ] ( ncop ) , dated 2 october 2000 , as follows :
with reference to the sentence : " all provinces have been consulted and they support the bill " , this bill was presented to minmec and not discussed in detail with each mec or province .
vote 8 - trade , industry and tourism ( auditor-general 's report [ pr 16 / 2000 - page 3 , paragraph 2.2.1 ( a ) ] ) : non-compliance with prescribed instructions : unauthorised expenditure , r201 654,18
mr speaker , in the debate yesterday the hon member mr n m isaacs reiterated points which we had already explained were not the contents of the letters that were read .
mr speaker , as chairperson of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling , i find it shocking that the hon member mr ozinsky does not wish to abide by the majority decision of the standing committee .
the anc wanted the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling to summons the independent electoral commission and every minister under section 115 of the constitution to deliver evidence before the standing committee .
we have stuck to our guns with regard to the condition that departments will in future not be required to assist others in the event of their encountering problems with their budgets .
against this background cabinet decided to direct a total of r15 million of the casino bid fee towards poverty relief and safety and security , details of which can be obtained from the responsible ministers .
mr speaker , if one compares the amount of r55,812 million with the roll-over amount of r115,479 million from 1996-97 to 1997-98 , and r107,206 million from 1997-98 to 1998-99 , one will note a huge reduction .
mr speaker , i would also like you to note that i , too , am going to introduce the motion in the correct manner and that there should , therefore , be no opposition to it .
mr speaker , let us look at the president 's blue-eyed boy and comrade , essop pahad , and his criticism of the media at the recent independent newspapers dinner for a group of highly influential international opinion-makers .
i would like to remind him of something , and i want to look the hon leader of the opposition specifically in the eye as i give him a little background about the hon member now sitting next to him .
" i must point out to you that it is not fair for hon members on that side of the house to be allowed to make comments continuously if people on this side are promptly called to order when they say something .
the anc has proved that it could change , in less than a decade , from a so-called liberation party into a party that makes a laughing stock of the principle of transparency and throws its democratic principles overboard .
chairpersons of committees are removed and other members of the committees are sent on study trips overseas in order to prevent the people who want to speed up the investigation from coming into contact with the media .
i wish that the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs , who is not here now , would go to manenberg to see that it is an area of filth every day of the week .
i would like to conclude by saying that the great leadership of our hon premier and the commitment of the hon minister of transport , sport and recreation only augurs well for all sports people of the western cape .
it does not matter whether it is an executive mayoral system or an executive committee system ; if a party truly wants to be where the decisions are made , why does it not then participate in the executive committee ?
( 3 ) believing that it is in the interest of the provincial taxpayers and the public to know how much was spent , especially when awards have been made to the premier by the said journal ;
the hon member mr silke hit the nail on the head when he spoke about selective caring - that the anc cared more about its own party 's survival than democracy .
the hon member then went on to say that the leader of the da , mr tony leon , went abroad to sow confusion about the national government 's hiv / aids stance .
if the hon member understands anything about confusion , he will understand how disastrous and confusing the attitude of president mbeki has been towards zimbabwe , hiv / aids , the r43 billion arms deal , judge heath and mr feinstein .
mr speaker , i want to pause for a moment and ask hon members here how they would respond to such a letter , where people complain that their white children are sent to predominantly black muslim schools .
however , it is also true that we who have been shamelessly hurt by the past , those of us who have been stripped of our dignity , our humanity , our pride and our homes , can never ever forget the past .
mr speaker , in the present situation the acdp sees itself as always being a force so as to create stability rather than instability and we will exercise this duty with diligence and wisdom .
the secular humanist path we are in is foreign to us as south africans and it has been finessed into our society camouflaged in the name of equality and non-discrimination .
in his opening address , the hon premier again proved that he does not stoop to petty political mudslinging , but focuses exclusively on the interests of the inhabitants of the western cape .
the truth of the matter is that if one looked at the breakdown of which areas are currently well-serviced by the police it would be 30 allocated to sea point and guguletu 10 .
he will appreciate that if we allowed members themselves to decide when they wanted to stand up in a debate to correct something they had said , we would have endless points of explanation .
they are not really asking what the new np have done , because the record on how the people have voted for the new np shows that they will not return to the house again .
] i was the person that kept it quiet , until the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism broached it yesterday , when he said that the anc had already put their cabinet together .
] the people of the southern cape very quickly told them , " we do not want you here and these are not the people we want taking part in this process .
it is also ironic that the same np that castigated our homeless people into squatter camps could now opportunistically claim to be champions in terms of housing provision to our people .
i fully support his appeal for members to watch their words and to avoid making hurtful , insensitive or inciting statements as these only help to fuel racial divides .
do we believe that we will be better able to rebuild the country by working - both as a partner and a constructive critic - with the anc government , or with the dp ?
if the hon premier looks at it and if he faces the facts directly , it cannot be acceptable that in a province such as ours there is no african person in the cabinet .
the new np hon members themselves must decide in their own caucus and in their federal council what the path is that they want to follow in supporting the vision of the president and the anc .
] it saddens me to think that the new np have joined in the cry of the dp to declare talking about racism in this province a racist act .
if the hon premier had realised that , he could not have gone through his whole speech and then said , " i cannot deal with poverty alleviation because i have no time .
that the hon member mr ozinsky loves quoting goebbels who apparently once said , " if you repeat a lie often enough people will think it is true .
mr speaker , during the opening of the national parliament on friday , 4 february , the president of the republic quoted correspondence that had been found in the electronic mail of one of our companies .
the struggle against racism calls all of us as politicians and residents in our different communities to recommit ourselves to fighting against this disease , the problem of the colour line in the western cape .
is that the message that hon members on that side of the house want to send out , by defiling symbols of our country which are sacred to us , such as our national anthem , in such a way ?
one stark example of this is 14-year-old valencia farmer of kleinvlei in the cape flats who was gang-raped and murdered seven months ago ; her killers have yet to come to trial .
a case was made here to the effect that the photographs to be taken would be kept by the coalition of the dp and the new np .
madam speaker , to cut a long story short , the speech of the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism clearly came from someone who was fighting for credibility , and nothing else .
it is a requirement of the public finance management act of 1999 that measurable objectives for each main division within a vote must also be submitted to the provincial parliament with the annual budget .
i would like to draw to the attention of the house that i specifically raised the question of airport arrival and departure taxes in the national council of provinces last year as a possible inclusion in the allowed list .
the establishment of new legislative structures , the restructuring of service delivery entities and the containment of expenditure within the social services sector are but a few of the challenges provinces in general had to face .
i am confident that the budget which i am tabling today will act as a catalyst for the western cape to enjoy a boom period of stability , prosperity and growth for all our citizens .
western cape nature conservation laws amendment bill [ b 3-2000 ] ( in accordance with standing rule 147 ( 3 ) ( b ) bill declared urgent measure by premier and published in provincial gazette for 7 days ) .
instead of toyi-toyiing , our people are still helping and cooperating to make our province an even better place for all its people under the sun .
mr speaker , in vote 10 we are encouraged by the fact that the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism said that the edc is being set up to support empowerment and black business .
mr speaker , if the chairperson and members of scof had performed properly and if you had had a better budget , we could have gone to malaysia to be with her in order to perform over there .
we accept them , but then we would also like them to be part of the formula that takes them into account here in the western cape where we are supplying education facilities , medical care and general services .
i wish to refer them to the two cabinet " bosberade " held some time ago , of which i hope they are all aware , or know about , unless after the election they lapsed into political hibernation .
i could not have done otherwise than to stand up and say that there was no business plan , although it might exist in someone 's conceptual framework , but it is not on paper .
departments should have a clear idea of who their liaison officer will be and who the reference person in the department of health will be , what form their activities will take and which groups must be reached .
a cardinal aspect of economic growth and permanent stability is to ensure economic empowerment by breaking down the barriers of racism and fragmentation created by the apartheid policies of the unpropitious dispensation .
the emphasis should not be the next election , but the next generation - just to reaffirm what my colleague said earlier - if we refuse to continue living in unbridled poverty .
you asked me what programmes and plans we have in place with regard to my desk after i had frustrated the hon member mr ozinsky by letting him repeat his question four times .
] i suppose that the ignorance that is displayed in this house comes from the fact that we have a running commentary from people who are not interested in hearing what one is saying .
they have undertaken to appoint an architect for the complete upgrading of members ' offices and also to investigate the changes required in order to accommodate private secretaries next to members in adjacent offices .
after the new , comprehensive , reconstituted standing rules of the parliament had passed the test of working in practice with outstanding results , the rules committee nevertheless decided that a subcommittee should investigate a few minor amendments which appeared to be necessary .
on our budget allocation this amounts to r4 000 per bill in order to advertise to ensure public participation and to go out to the communities - in other words , to be truly effective .
he did make the position clear , but it is unfortunately the duty of this parliament to provide a good legal service capacity for the chairpersons of the standing committees in order for them to produce good laws .
we have also seen in that saga how the majority on the rules and internal arrangements committee has relegated the rules to a mere nice frill on the sleeve of unbridled political power .
a problem we have is that very highly skilled african people in particular , who are working at the national parliament and gaining experience in that environment , will not come to our parliament because of the difference in salary .
the officials have been working on a policy which must negotiated with other officials , with the whole staff complement , as hon members know , and we really hope that we will be making good progress in this regard .
i also arranged for mr chris mulder to meet with an official in my office on 17 december 1999 to discuss the development and hand over a file of documents setting out the developer 's case .
mr speaker , clearly , both the government departments and the people who attended the meeting were misled into believing this was an official government meeting when it was actually a dp meeting .
mr speaker , as far as wearing two hats is concerned , i am being honest when i say i went as both the minister of environmental and cultural affairs and as the deputy leader of the dp .
mr speaker , in my discussions with the office of the auditor-general concerning this issue , the auditor-general very clearly said that they did not have a right to use provincial funds for voter registration .
mr speaker , they say that empty vessels make the most sound , and that is what we are seeing here - a member becoming so furious about something that really is not a problem at all .
more important than anything else is the fact that the hon member should rather go to asset management and look at the respective zonings of land that has been put on the market to be sold .
it can be mentioned that at this stage we are involved in a programme for offenders in the province and also in the network against violence inflicted on women and the western cape child abuse forum .
if hon members would like to refer to the famous dictionary of the hon member mr ozinsky , the answer is " practicable " means as soon as one is able to do so after a process has been gone through .
( 3 ) cheques for transfer payments from the departmental budget are handled in the prescribed manner set out in the relevant treasury instructions by the authorised official of the department of environmental and cultural affairs .
i , however , requested the chairperson of the western cape provincial tender board to furnish me with the reasons why the tender was not awarded to the tenderer recommended by the department of health .
mr speaker , from the fact that the hon member mr dugmore said what he did , that i did not sign it , it seems to me that he has more information than i have .
mr speaker , i forgot to mention earlier that i have a letter from judge heath , which i will give to the hon member mr dugmore , in which he thanks me for my cooperation .
( iv ) on 25 january 2000 attended a meeting at the office of the west coast district council in moorreesburg where outstanding issues were discussed between all relevant role-players , including the complainant and legal representatives of the council and the developer .
( 1 ) whether any of the newly appointed security guards at the provincial parliament have undergone special training prior to their appointment ; if so , ( a ) over what period of time and ( b ) what type of training ;
] nothing prevented the standing committee from forming an independent opinion and , quite frankly , it is up to them to have assisted with that process .
what is also very clear to me is that the reason behind what we have just heard is the fact that mr vogt , the farm owner , is a member of the new np and also a councillor in that district .
after prolonged consultations , the cabinet decided , again on the initiative of the hon premier , that a task team should be appointed to look at the demographic distribution of the labour force in the province .
now that the hon member ms essop has told me where she got that information , i can give her a sealed letter indicating that i know precisely who has allowed information to be leaked .
my question to the hon minister , against the background that i have set out briefly , is : what is his planning for the future to prevent similar violence , should unrest of this nature take place again ?
since these schools were mainly small farm and church schools , some owners indicated that the buildings were needed for other purposes that made the further existence of these schools impossible .
( 2 ) after a workshop , which i attended with senior officials of the branch : transport , a draft business plan to address the issues raised by the taxi industry in a systematic way was prepared .
the former minister of finance and development planning then told the house on numerous occasions that there was no need to delay the implementation because of the unconstitutionality of the act .
at present the total number of stock-out items is the lowest ever at 78 items , of which 35 are related to a firm that has been liquidated , out of the over 3 000 items we hold in stock .
a workshop was held with a reference group from a wide spectrum of the public and private expertise to obtain their input before the draft green paper is submitted to cabinet and me .
my question to the hon minister is : is it possible for us to see the recommendations relating to the portfolio under his control made by the provincial property committee at the meeting ?
as soon as the certificate has been issued by the national minister for agriculture and land affairs , the registrar of deeds will be instructed to endorse the said properties in the name of the government of the western cape .
however , the big problem is it creates a bottle-neck at the end of the day when the pharmacists are not able to assist all the patients that went through either the nurse-driven service or the doctor-driven service .
it was spent on the consultants for drawing up the regulations in terms of the western cape planning and development act , act 7 of 1999 , and for the drafting of a manual in this regard .
mr speaker , i believe it was good that the muslim judicial council and the jewish board of deputies came out and condemned the actions that took place at mcdonald 's on saturday .
but i would urge the hon leader of the opposition to get a tape from cape talk where every caller said that what they did was incitement by the anc .
i am confident that the hon minister of social services and poverty relief will make a positive contribution to the work of the government and to the quality of life of all the people of the western cape .
the hon minister of local government and development planning shares this vision of cooperative governance and , with his detailed understanding of local government , will be instrumental in forging lasting partnerships with local authorities .
i believe the right process should be that every member of the department involved in the different programmes should be available in the budgetary process for the main budget and not the adjustments appropriation .
in regard to his comments on the olympic projects , if i remember rightly from my involvement specifically in so far as the consultants were concerned , a sum of r3 million approximately was what we had to pay in consultant fees alone .
secondly , there is the utilisation of savings under a main division within a vote for the defrayment of excess expenditure under another main division within the same vote in terms of section 43 , otherwise known as virement .
then there is , of course , the letter that the hon leader of the opposition referred to from somebody called thabo mabaso , and i almost believe that he encouraged him to write the letter .
mr speaker , if you would permit me before answering the question , i wish to say that we as the house congratulate the hon member mr silke on his wedding on sunday .
the final version , as approved by the provincial cabinet , was entitled " the western cape revenue and expenditure policy framework " and was widely distributed among interested organisations in both the public and private sectors .
madam chairperson , as for social pensions and grants , with the approval of the provincial treasury , all debts older than three years - approximately r13 million - are in the process of being written off .
although the first phase of the system was originally planned to go live in early december last year , the implementation date has since been extended to june 2000 due to a number of legal and technical problems .
what was implemented was the old ten point procurement policy of the national government and , in fact , eight , nine or eight and a half of the points of the procurement policy have been put in place .
as the hon minister said , the medium-term expenditure framework has been designed to bring policies and objectives together in an envelope , but the departments , by their own admission , have a very poor understanding of the policies .
my staff - in both finance and development planning , i might say - would be able to tell the house that this matter is constantly on the agenda in my weekly meetings with them .
it can do no harm , and even if , at the end of the story , we sit down and say , " there is nothing we can do , " we will at least know that we have tried to achieve something .
in the same way that i am asking the hon member mr gabru to bring me evidence , or take the evidence to the board , if it is evidence and can be substantiated ...
according to available census data which , we all know , is totally incorrect , just over 4 million people reside in the western cape , which amounts to 1 functionally trained police official for every 403 members of the community .
this project will unify cpfs even more and will allow us to apply uniform rules to all cpfs in the province and eradicate much of the debilitating infighting that takes place .
madam chairperson , provincial and local government departments will , in conjunction with community-based initiatives , take responsibility for providing the necessary essential services and funding to achieve a semblance of normalcy where communities live .
the anc also challenges the hon minister and any hon member on that side of the house specifically to join neighbourhood watches and begin to participate actively in the struggle against crime .
community safety affects all the people in the province , and that is why i want say to the saps and , in particular , the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation that we are watching them closely .
these events have a direct impact on the way sport is organised and should have resulted in the amalgamation of the national sport council and the national department of sport and recreation .
madam chairperson , if one goes to different schools in different areas , if one takes a walk to rustenburg and to westerford , there is a great difference between them and sezeka in guguletu and silverstream in manenberg .
in the western cape 92 people were killed and even though this is the third lowest death rate in the country , and even though we had the heaviest holiday traffic of all the provinces , that is still 92 lives too many .
and that the minister of community safety , sport and recreation was possibly altogether unaware of this when making his input yesterday , or alternatively neglected to take it into consideration at all , and further that the house -
when prof servaas van den bergh of the university of stellenbosch presented his retrospective and prospective analysis of the provincial budget on 28 february , he chose to highlight the circumstances of the department of education .
fifthly , we want to focus on appropriate infrastructural development and , sixthly , we wish to establish effective schools-based management , bringing more authority and accountability for performance to the place where effective learning and teaching has to take place .
i have no intention of destroying mr don pasquallie 's credibility by thanking him publicly for his very constructive contribution to this process , so i will not do that .
for example , when we provide information technology to schools , we will give priority to all historically disadvantaged schools which show that they are getting the basics in place and are developing good management systems .
mr chairperson , ngos are helping us enormously in this endeavour , visiting schools and running programmes , while we seek to train educators and integrate hiv / aids education into the curriculum from grade 1 onwards .
we are merging smaller colleges to create significant economies of scale in larger institutions , a good example being the recent merger of strand , stellenbosch and paarl technical colleges to form the boland technical college .
needless to say the department is refunding the full amount , going beyond the rand-for-rand basis , as a gesture of thanks and goodwill for the exceptional initiative shown .
mr chairperson , there are other essential programmes which require more funding and for this reason we must unfortunately still seek to reduce our personnel costs further to achieve a ratio of 85 : 15 .
thirdly , the school curriculum will be adapted to allow for a wider subject choice for pupils so that they do not leave school early , develop behavioural problems and become a burden to the community and the state .
the problem about the national norms and standards that upset most people was that there were two schools in the same area with exactly the same socio-economic conditions , and they found themselves in different categories .
we all know that more funds would be welcome , but from their presentation it is clear that they have managed to make the most of the just over r4 billion at their disposal .
while dwelling on the matter of the southern cape , i must just make mention of a person whose dedication to education is exemplary and who needs to be recognised for her outstanding work in this area .
accordingly i need not devote further time to that now except to comment briefly on a problem he raised which came from one mr lewis at a meeting in wellington .
in expectation of the requirements relating to financial administration in terms of the public financial management act , r11 million has been earmarked to strengthen financial systems and train appropriate financial and administrative staff .
the improvements at the eye clinic of the tygerberg hospital which were brought about out donor funds from shoprite checkers , are an outstanding example of what could be done with the r130 000 that they spent there .
on the basis of what we have seen being done in the wards with r110 000 and r130 000 , the more than r1 million that we are going to spend in some of these institutions will make a big difference .
before moving from this topic , i would like to ask the following questions , as asked by the people living with disabilities : is our province in any way promoting and implementing the disability rights charter of south africa ?
firstly , let me extend my thanks to the department of health and in particular to drs lawrence , sutcliffe and abdullah , who have been exemplary in their dealings with the standing committee and scof over the past week .
it has been impossible for the health services to come out of the process of downsizing unscathed , and the department has done an admirable job of managing the crisis by effectively reshaping the profile of its services .
of course , service delivery is one aspect , and the hon minister has discussed that , but this budget , with the slant that the hon minister has given it , is really a fresh start for the department of health .
i think we should go back to the unions - not only when it comes to mathematics and science teachers - to ensure that we can take back well-trained nurses who have taken voluntary severance packages .
in an attempt to increase the accessibility of offices to the users of all services rendered by the branch , the establishment of three new offices will commence during the 2000-01 financial year .
it was resolved that the documents on file at each of the district offices would be scanned in locally at the district offices , but to commence with this project only after the re-registration process has been finalised .
in addition , they harp ad nauseam on the amount of r10 million that was allocated by the province to the poverty relief portfolio , as if this is not also for the poor of the province .
the policies and programmes formulated at this office which affect people living in poverty will respect their dignity and culture and make full use of their knowledge , skills and resources .
if only 6 300 children are on the books and receiving grants , it means that there are a lot more people who have not been included in the past and who are not included now .
madam chairperson , i would like to digress from my main speech and say that i feel very proud today to be part of the house purely because of the expressions regarding the plight of the poor .
there is very little one can do with it besides giving it to those who are over the age of 60 or 65 who qualify for grants , and so on .
we will perhaps not consider the waiting-list and the issue of being centralised in the waiting-list quite so urgently , but at least a debate could take place in the standing committee in that regard .
that the house welcomes the prompt action by the provincial ministers of transport and works and of agriculture for ensuring the opening of the main route between cape town and port elizabeth via oudtshoorn in the little karoo .
it will at least enable us to honour our commitments in the new financial year and also to restructure our planning for the next few financial years in order to accommodate the reduced mtef amount .
in that particular act there are certain mechanisms which i thought would perhaps have been in draft form by now in order to protect those people who are suffering the oppression of being backyard dwellers .
we from the anc will speak to our national minister and ask that the deadline be extended to allow all our people to take transfer of houses which they have been renting for years .
] look at the way in which the hon premier has treated the hon member mr marais , someone who had taken major steps in this province to put in place a programme to alleviate poverty .
the housing backlog as estimated by the national department of housing is in the region of 1,92 million units for urban housing , and just over 300 000 units for rural families , who continue to endure unacceptable living conditions .
madam chairperson , another problem confronting us - i say this today in all humility - is the fact that we frequently make politics out of the housing needs of our people .
that is why i said that we must go about things differently with the consolidation subsidies , because the money has to be paid over to an attorney for him to make the payments , not my department or me .
mr chairperson , on a point of order : the hon member mr mckenzie has been addressing the hon minister as " you " for approximately three minutes now .
madam chairperson , during an earlier debate i mentioned that we would have to do everything in our power to make the restructuring of municipalities , whether within or outside the metropole , proceed as smoothly as possible .
add to these shortcomings the fact that many municipalities were faced with service backlogs and deteriorating infrastructure or , in some cases , even collapsed infrastructure , and one has a recipe for problems .
a total of r703 million was transferred to local government in the 1998-99 financial year and r696 million was transferred to local government in the 1999-2000 financial year , but the problem is that none of these amounts appear on provincial budgets .
it is money given to our minister via the backdoor , so we do not have any control over it , we cannot scrutinise it and we do not know how they spend it .
i thought it was somewhat of a slap in the face to say that the other political parties did not have the necessary skills to be able to take part in that type of forum .
many of that 80 % are from the poor communities , farm workers , and people from coloured and black communities , and also poor whites at places such as george , where the new np has not noticed the people .
i should also mention at this stage that r10,78 million has been allocated as transfer payments to the provincial development council , which will receive r2,2 million , and to local authorities , which will receive a total of r8,5 million .
hon members will recall that during 1996 , cabinet approved the application of bioregional planning principles in spatial planning projects in the western cape and endorsed the vision that the province would eventually be covered with a cluster of biosphere reserves .
the department 's subdirectorate : information management will continue to concentrate on two important cabinet objectives , namely , firstly , capacitating local government to do integrated development planning , and , secondly , drafting and promoting an effective provincial integrated development framework .
provincial planning , with support from the development planning committee - a process to which i referred earlier - will be assisted by the newly formed provincial information committee .
census information and voter registration figures from the independent electoral commission were also provided to the consultants appointed by the ministry of local government to deal with the transformation of local authorities outside the metropolitan area .
the process involved detailed public participation and close liaison with the department of land affairs to ensure that the policy adhered to the provisions of the extension of security of tenure act of 1997 .
for those hon members who are not in the know , a biosphere reserve is a specific type of conservation area that accommodates and benefits both the natural environment and the communities living in and around it .
i would like to say to the hon minister of finance and development planning that i really respect where this is coming from , but it is so easy to stand up and say , " environment , environment , environment !
at the senior management level , there is zero african representation , there is one person defined as asian , there are 15 individuals defined as coloured and the white representation amounts to 65 .
the act goes further and aims at promoting security of tenure while ensuring that the end user 's finance , in the form of subsidies and loans , becomes available as early as possible .
i have not had to be nasty to him in any way nor do i intend to be , because it is not in my nature .
i have half a mind to say to the hon member ms essop that she should come and sit with me , so that we can make plans together and hear what her suggestions are .
in total , the allocation to libraries in the form of subsidies and expenditure for material guidance in this budget amounts to r34,209 million , which gives a perspective on the scale of delivery on library services in this province .
the problem is that we will increasingly see staff members of the provincial administration leaving the administration to set up their own consultancies to do the work that they previously did in this department .
this is a culture which developed after the release of slaves , with the coming of the germans to south africa and the mixing that took place , and the particular emphasis that they placed on christmas eve .
we feel that this bill should have come here earlier because the effective date for the introduction of the board is next week , 1 april , and we hope it will go through .
the department and the hon minister implied that the policy and draft regulations had been drawn up and that advertising could be commenced immediately and that the legislation could be implemented by february .
we say that by the second half of this year we should be able to put on the table the social charter , in which the people will state what type of public transport they want .
what is happening at present is that the big contractor gets the work , and appoints a subcontractor who negotiates a loan with the bank , and after the wages have been paid , the subcontractor cannot keep his head above water .
jeffares & green of v3 , for example , and others , have obtained a great deal of work from the department , and get a lot of work in the province and at municipalities ; work that could keep them busy for the next few years .
madam chairperson , it is a privilege to speak here today in support of the transport budget , but to say that i am satisfied with the allocation to this vote is far from the truth .
in addition , i promised this morning in the meeting of the standing committee that with mr petersen 's support i would manage this thing in an effort to get something on the ground towards the end of this year .
] he may as well go home and tell his voters that he served in parliament for 21 years and for 21 years he made sustained efforts to have the worcester-robertson road upgraded .
cape country furniture produces quality furniture and related products for primarily the british market , which is sold in specific stores in the uk , under the cape country furniture label , thereby contributing a unique product branding .
on the other hand , the retail sector of the liquor industry is marked by a huge disregard for the law , it being estimated that nearly 80 % of all liquor selling points in this province operate outside the law .
we will also drive the bid for a r8 million western cape innovation support centre ( isc ) , which will be an important institution focusing on the commercialisation of new products and technologies , processes and innovations .
the department will also stimulate awareness around the broader impact that aids will have on the economy in terms of lost man hours through attendance of funerals , the rise in medical aid costs and the loss of skills .
madam chairperson , on the outsourcing front delegated authority has been obtained from the western cape provincial tender board for the appointment of property brokers and agents , to assist the chief directorate with managing estates and other property transactions .
one of the most significant contracts that we recently signed was for the leasing of floor space in groote schuur hospital to a private company controlled by the university of cape town for the operation of a private clinic .
we talk about the global economy of e-commerce , of the web page industries , and we are expected to go on the global stage , and we have to sit at night and dream of ideas ; that is impossible .
due to its many natural assets as well as the exposure gained through cape town 's bid for the 2004 olympic games , the western cape experienced even higher growth rates than the national average .
madam chairperson , i had the good fortune to be invited to participate in a global knowledge ii conference cohosted by the malaysian government , the world bank and the undp recently .
we are very proud to say that we know that other local authorities have taken the initiative and are starting to look at an integrated , coordinated approach to policy development concerning the promotion of the informal trading sector .
the hon member ms essop asked me where her box of last year is , but she has such a small tank that i hope she can still get by with last year 's box .
in the western cape there are communities that are so politically active that one cannot give them money because they cannot organise themselves to be ready to take the money .
in the western cape 92 people were killed and even though this is the third lowest death rate in the country , and even though we had the heaviest holiday traffic of all the provinces , that is still 92 lives too many .
if we consider what has happened over the last couple of weeks in the western cape , we will see that in worcester , for instance , an interdict was issued because of violence between taxis .
we believe that the constitutional right i have mentioned gives us the necessary constitutional powers to defend and muster constitutional support for the legislation before the house today .
the bill is quite stringent regarding this issue and it states that the minister must listen to representations after he has published it in the government gazette , the time for this being no less than 24 hours .
during the last 51 days of dispute there has been no word from the government , nor was there an initiative from them to normalise the situation in the interests of everybody .
mr speaker , whilst we support the extraordinary measures - we have called for extraordinary measures in the past - we wish to say that the closing of ranks cannot be a lasting solution .
mr speaker , i call upon the hon ministers of transport and works , and of community safety , sport and recreation to recognise the value of the lives of all the citizens of this province .
in my opinion the entire matter relating to the taxi violence which broke out could perhaps have been dealt with differently or even better had there been proactive action on the part of the provincial government .
at the memorial services , the prayer meetings on the street , between the cups of tea and almost everywhere where people have met and gathered , the following was said and is still being said : " the cape flats are burning .
the anc has , through me , asked that the provincial parliament deal with the situation on the cape flats and the impact on women and children in particular as a matter of the utmost urgency and public importance .
why is it in order to brutally kill human beings in soldiers ' uniforms from other countries who threaten our land but it is unconstitutional to hang murderers and rapists within our borders ?
there is no way that they can paint crime differently ; crime must be punished , but it seems to me the hon member agrees that crime pays when it comes to certain people .
before hon members blacken my name or that of my family or my colleagues here , they should first go and listen to what the person says who is responsible for combating crime in this country .

mr speaker , to coin a phrase , " one does not have to be a graduate of the gerald morkel school of quick-thinking to get to the heart of this matter .
in fact , irrespective of the request from the central government , this province merely responded to the appeal by thousands of voters who had the constitutional right to cast their votes .
it seems to me as though their actions could give rise to many questions ; among other things , this means that they are intimating today that the state as an employer can exploit people who are employed by it .
however , the only registration weekend which took place anywhere near the matric examinations was the first weekend for voter registration , and that weekend began at 17 : 00 on a friday and ended at 17 : 00 on a sunday .
madam chairperson , i want to ask the hon minister whether that money could not have been better used on the children who as a result of her policy did not go to school in january .
madam chairperson , the cabinet decision was that special incentives up to a maximum of r1 000 would be given to officials assisting with the voter registration process in the western cape on 5 , 6 and 7 march .
therefore , on another level , if hon members would like to ask questions to further those areas that they would like to further , they then take that procedure through their questions , interpellations and so on .
madam chairperson , in pursuing democracy in this country , yes , it was very well spent state money since the central government had neglected to do its duty in providing adequate funds .
madam chairperson , the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs is on record in saying that he does not have enough people to manage all the things that he needs to do in his department .
will she ask the department for information , or will we have to provide her with proof , and within what time-frame after bringing that proof can we expect her to express her condemnation ?
that the house calls on the standing committee on governmental affairs and community safety to convene an urgent meeting to discuss the sale by public auction of rdp houses by certain councils in the province .
however , mr speaker , we should all accept that rome was not built in a day , but we should also accept the fact that whilst it was under construction the people could see it grow .
if we do not conduct ourselves in that way then we shall continue to fail as we have already done quite seriously , particularly under the leadership of former minister wiley .
therefore , sir , the statement made by the minister is not just unfortunate , but i regard it as highly irresponsible the way the minister said they must " adapt or die " .
our people at grassroots level are suffering too much and therefore our leaders cannot irresponsibly make promises to them when we know full well that those promises can never be fulfilled .
i would like to commend supt van niekerk and his team in george for these arrests and trust that this is the start of the major clean-up to get rid of this unwanted scourge in our society .
the anc are gambling with the voters of south africa and they hope that somewhere they will fare better but increasingly the dice are falling badly for them , and that is making them worried .
this reversal of their previous policy , whereby such antiretrovirals were started much earlier and more aggressively , needs to be noted and should influence a rational approach to this debate .
the cape argus of 2 february 2001 and local radio stations gave outstanding coverage of the 23 unemployed labourers in the beaufort west area who were brought to the boland on a false pretext by a white farmer .
imagine my shock this morning when i read in the cape times - the very day after we are told that - that the cameras are about to be installed on the n2 .
hon members may have read it in the cape times , but my good friend the hon member mr r williams reads the cape argus and he may not have read it in the cape times .
mr speaker , a former colleague of mine in the cape town city council , eulalie stott , used to say , " i would take money from the devil himself in order to spend it on housing .
tomorrow during my turn to speak i shall reply in full to the allegations made today by the hon member and then i shall place the facts on the table for him , to show where we stand .
madam chairperson , does the hon mec think it is appropriate that the department of planning , governmental affairs and housing should play a gatekeeper role with regard to the legislation for the appointment of a commissioner ?
this applies to all those who applied and who did not necessarily qualify because of their car not being on that particular person 's name , but perhaps on a cousin 's name .
we cannot do it with 5 % or 2 % shares , as is being mooted at the moment , where it is said that the small and medium enterprises can only have a 2 % share .
every few years , like clockwork , we have a reign of terror perpetrated by people who claim the right by force and violence to dictate to others how they will conduct their lives .
mr speaker , i therefore call upon the hon minister to lead the province and govern the province regardless of party lines , because we are dealing with lives and people are dying .
moreover , not a word of condemnation did we see from the dp - especially with their knack of utilising the press as well as they do - until it was relatively safe .
mr speaker , the idea was that we had to negotiate the maximum benefit for our tourism industry and for that reason the request was made that the successful candidate make r135 million available for the construction of such a convention centre .
then we would not issue guarantees , but ancillary , incidental to the issuing of the guarantees is the duty contained in the shareholders ' agreement to indemnify the other shareholders in case of losses .
we are concerned about the fact that the hon minister , in hastily rushing the bill through and in respect of the shortcomings in the shareholders ' agreement , has sullied a worthwhile and commendable initiative such as the convention centre .
mr speaker , this convention centre may be regarded as one of the objectives of the provincial government to provide a new doorway for tourism in africa and meaning to tourism on the southern tip of africa .
nationally , there are no other examples of this kind of animal , this " investment private company " that we are creating , and therefore it is not covered by the pfma .
i want to inform the hon minister that , in fact , there is a subsection in this agreement that states that we as the public sector component of the agreement can purchase shares , subject to a maximum of r60 million .
madam chairperson , with all due respect , the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism knew about this , because he in fact reaffirmed in the standing committee that we would be moving this amendment here today .
however , from my handwritten notes i see that after reading the clause to the hon minister in the standing committee at that stage , i said that what he had said was not true .
it was redundant , because if the province wanted to make additional financial contributions in terms of subsection ( 1 ) , they would be covered in any case in terms of the adjustment estimates process and in terms of subsection ( 1 ) ( b ) .
even on p 3 , line 7 , the word " shareholders " was deleted and the word " convenco " was substituted and that applies wherever it comes up .
( 1 ) noting that the premier has announced the appointment of a committee to consider the future of the new np mp , mr a williams , after his conviction of fraud , corruption and theft ;
( 1 ) expresses its thanks to all the members of the saps and the sandf who took part in operation crackdown in atlantis , and in particular congratulates them on the success achieved with this particular action ;
] the hon minister informed the house what the anc had said in the standing committee , but added that he had not heard the representatives of the department say , " no comment " .
this is your constituency that stood by you for 15 years , and then they turned their backs on you ; then you either misled them , or lied to them and never gave them the truth .
if a municipality fails to fulfil an executive obligation , the provincial government may take appropriate steps to ensure that the obligation is fulfilled , subject to the approval of the ncop .
before calling upon the next speaker , the table has pointed out to me that the hon member mr isaacs used the word " lieg " and not the word " leuen " .
that aside , mr speaker , it is generally acknowledged that local government has now been accorded a distinctive status and role in building democracy and promoting socio-economic development at the local level .
we knew that they would not have a quorum , and this is our duty whenever the standing committee becomes a mere rubber stamp of the executive in an effort to ensure that this is averted .
the simple reason for this is that the system concentrates so much power in one person that the voters must have the opportunity to consider and decide on the qualities and qualifications of the person .
the udm believes that if it can be proved that the judiciary is misused for purposes other than judicial hearings , the government of the day should be asked to discharge such judges from their posts .
] from these judgments , i feel that we cannot run away from the fact that we have judges who give judgments based on their social background , which is where females are seen as subordinate to males .
in the prime of his legal career he had to go and seek out a future in namibia , whereas the very government that the hon minister and other speakers represent , refused to give him an opportunity .
sir , on a more serious note , when the hon premier , some others and i decided to join the np some years ago , we did it for basically two reasons .
if there is one white left in zimbabwe , that poor person will continue to be blamed for all the mismanagement and misrule of mugabe , and that is exactly what the anc is doing .
the dp 's brand of political ventriloquism is that when they look to the left they speak with the face of helen suzman and when they look to the right they speak the language of swart gevaar .
] i say today as leader of the anc in the western cape that we have not been able to persuade them that the anc will treat coloured poverty and african poverty equally .
for the most part these factors are applied to previously disadvantaged entrepreneurs who are characterised by poor credit records , as i have already mentioned , as a result of historic situations , created by collective political actions such as rent boycotts and violence in townships .
we wrote to the human rights commission asking that the prima facie case should be established , and the reply from them was that it would be helpful if they could be furnished with specific cases of discrimination .
when bank guarantees have to be given , the banks reject a house as collateral security because it is in a redlined area , and people are forced into joint ventures .
if the black partner does not take that route - although he has the contract , but not the finance - he then defaults on the contract , which gives him a bad name .
timeousness ( reproduction of the required number of papers / copies within the set time frames ) ; quality ( readability and completeness of the papers ) ; and security ( ensuring that no " leaks " occur ) ;
the committee further recommends that proper documentation and details of all cases where amounts are to be recovered from other persons or institutions be maintained in order that the administration does not suffer any losses .
mr speaker , on a point of order : i would like to refer you to the rules , which makes it very clear that a motion of substantively the same content cannot be moved in the same session .
mr speaker , if i can just conclude , it is clear that the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works has had the mat moved from under him and that is why he now wants to move this motion .
the hon member mr n m isaacs is also well aware of how time and time again people from both sides of the house criticised the unfair rates that people in the townships had to pay .
however , prior to its implementation in july 1993 it became clear that the shift in the rates burden based on the new valuation would move away from the poorer areas to the wealthier areas .
the dp council at the time never opposed that challenge and the new voters ' rolls were not implemented , thereby compromising any future endeavour to bring about greater fairness in our rating system .
the coming of the anc has meant that at least a start has been made with service once a week in places like athlone , whereas under the regime of the dp they would not have received that .
what they want to do here is to in fact encourage people not to pay for services and to tell them , " do not worry , you will be financed by rates " .
madam speaker , if the state is not capable of putting a stop to murders on farms then i appeal to this house to take active steps to ensure the safety of our agricultural community in the western cape .
there is a deep malaise in our society - it is not limited to the farms , as one finds it everywhere - where life itself has become something which has no sanctity .
there should also be an effective communication system linking the farm to neighbouring farms and security firms , and precautions should be taken to vary one 's habits when arriving at or leaving the farms .
that in future all members first be taken through a capacity building exercise whereby the outcome based budgeting process and terminology is explained to them , whereafter ad hoc committees are appointed to discuss the various chapters of the document .
( 1 ) expresses its serious concern and shock with the regularity with which especially children are being murdered in the province , and the inability of the national government to protect its citizens from these callous killers ;
( 2 ) notes that the magistrate , mr m van graan , did not consider alternative charges such as assault or culpable homicide , notwithstanding certain provisions in the criminal procedures act ( no 51 of 1977 ) ; and
the western cape ninth gambling and racing amendment bill before us is critical in streamlining the regulation of gambling in the province , and more specifically the protection of the industry and the public .
mr speaker , a mechanism is now in place whereby those wishing to conduct social gambling involving the possession of gambling devices will be required to approach the board for an authorisation .
] according to both the constitution and the executive members ' ethics act , family trusts would definitely fall within the ambit of " any other person " and " any other interests " .
from the v & a waterfront there is mr jack ; otto stellig from the protea hotels group ; and mr brian mcdonald , who has interests in the convention industry , according the hon minister on cape talk 567 talk radio .
we believe that in terms of the executive members ' ethics act , act 82 of 1998 , the public protector is obliged to investigate this , because there is a complaint on the table .
he certainly did not declare them to the convenco board and i think that it is extremely relevant that in his declaration of interests he omitted such an important piece of information , just omitted it .
however , i specifically asked my wife and my youngest son to be present in the gallery today because i want them to hear the type of accusations that are being made against me ...
our people will understand that it takes painstaking work to find and convict such terrorists , but they need to see harmony defining the relationship between the different levels of government and the different organs of state .
crime and violence flourish on division and strife within government and that is why i believe the note of cooperation and support sounded by the hon leader of the opposition is exactly appropriate .
i must tell hon members that since i have come into this position , the level of cooperation between the national government and this government on the two key issues , the taxi violence and urban terror , have really been exemplary .
when we in our pamphlet quote someone saying , " coloureds breed like rabbits " , " they have filthy mouths " and " not in someone 's lifetime will coloureds come right " , that is hate speech .
however , unlike the anc , we do not believe that one combats racism by re-racialising society , reintroducing race classification and applying quotas to all walks of life .
can one imagine , mr speaker , if we on this side of the house sank to the same level of inventing quotes and doing other things ?
the fact that this rectification did not take place , particularly when there were opportunities to do so , arouses suspicion and opens the door to broad interpretations , speculations and accusations , whether these are justified or not .
unless we recognise that our poverty and affluence patterns take particular colour lines in the main , we will not understand the roots of inequality and the subsequent instability which our country , and our province in particular , is going through .
for the hon member to engage the house in constructive debate , he would have to raise the qualitative level of his motion and present it in the sincere and constructive manner that it deserves .
are we to forget that after his inauguration president sam nujoma had the custom - and it is a fine custom - of travelling from town to town and meeting his people .
mr speaker , in conclusion , i would like to thank all my cabinet colleagues , especially the members of the ptc , the director-general , department heads and the staff of the province for their diligent input and support during this process .
this relationship between employer and employee finds expression in that particular relationship that has developed - not in the course of a day or two , nor a week or two , but over months and years .
in fact , the empowerment of all those who were effectively excluded by legislation from farming also depends largely on the input from existing commercial farmers in order to achieve any measure of success .
if there is a close connection between the anc , cosatu and the sacp , and they prescribe things to one another , i want to emphasise to them that that is not the case with organised agriculture .
the committee wishes to express its dissatisfaction with the relevant parties for the long delay to obtain and issue the necessary guidelines since the inception of the housing act on 1 april 1998 .
the committee wishes to express its dissatisfaction at the lack of training in and disregard for tender board directives , but takes cognisance of the steps taken by the department toward improving the situation in this regard .
during the 1995 / 1996 to 1998 / 1999 financial years an amount of r1,8 million was collected in this regard and paid into the provincial revenue fund but not the funds of the provincial housing board ;
the committee heard and considered evidence which indicated that the monitoring of institutions which receive financial assistance from the administration did not receive the necessary attention due to staff shortages .
the process of ensuring that ministers are held accountable and that there is oversight - especially over the use of taxpayers ' money - is a crucial element of the role of the provincial parliament .
we would not have had a parliamentary programme on our desks , and also delivered to that hon member 's desk , if the whips of the different parties had not come to an agreement .
i want to repeat the question : what would they have expected - and i ask this of the people of the whole province , including the people who voted for the anc , mistakenly ...
hon members will notice that , as promised - and , once again , we keep our promises - no provision has been made for any overexpenditure in health and education and , for that matter , any other department .
that the house thanks the minister of transport , sport and recreation and the department of sport and recreation for allocating the sum of r1 332 900 to 19 municipalities for the development of sport in the province .
when they did an analysis - and hon members know that casinos have been established for only one year in this country - they looked at the figures of habitual gamblers .
instead , we have a ruling party that muzzles its own members and those of its own watchdog creations , provides jobs and contracts for its own pals and cronies , and perpetuates racism in its election campaigns and public rhetoric .
these factors , your honour , cause the man in the street to despair and confront the anc with the reality that as a government they have failed not only a test , but the examination .
we have a difficult struggle to build one nation in this country after 300 years of dividing this country into various groups , into various race groups and into various areas where different people have to stay .
i would like to indicate that , not through fancy statistics as quoted here today , but through a simple graph which shows the results of the election which even that side of the house can understand .
on the contrary , we will make the performing arts and the natural environment more accessible to people through various initiatives aimed at lowering the barriers and removing the obstacles that they encounter .
during the apartheid years they arrested our leaders and our people , and people were even arrested for using the word " apartheid " or mentioning the word " victimisation " in the workplace .
if those hon members had enough power , they would even arrest us for mentioning the word " racism " in this province , but fortunately they do not have the power to do that .
let me refer to what happened after the election , and give a vision and link this to what the hon premier asked for , in fact , what he demanded , close cooperation between the three spheres of government .
it is very important that we all play an active role , that we encourage our communities to participate in the idp processes , because those processes will eventually guide our budget process and , of course , our future service delivery .
there is also nothing credible about that particular line of attack , as the electorate in the western cape are desperately trying to explain to the anc - and did in the last election .
the western cape government fought for the lives of those babies who were at risk of hiv infection when the national leader of the party in opposition here was questioning the very existence of the virus ;
mr speaker , he will find his party coming up hard against this simple reality : as the clock ticks for the anc nationally , so the anc 's prospects in the western cape trickle away .
what the dp does , because it is so desperate for votes from anyone , is to respond to and reinforce all the racism and sectarianism in our community , and that for a few votes .
without any bitterness we can use the shameful lessons of the past to build a better and brighter future for all our people , especially those who are being disadvantaged by the deeds of the past .
to prevent such a situation in the new democracy in our province , the province must engage in a radical programme of human resource development to develop the underdeveloped , the neglected and the discriminated .
however , since it took apartheid more than 40 years to favour and empower only one sector of the south african community , affirmative action has certainly a long way to go to level the playing-field .
mr speaker , whatever the facts are the truth is that there is a large portion of people in the province that feel truly marginalised and we need to come up with a solution .
mr speaker , it is an exceptional privilege to reply to the formidable speech which our hon premier delivered last tuesday , 8 february , at the annual opening of the western cape parliament .
i was listening yesterday to see whether the anc were examining it , but all they did was to criticise and to see what tools we have with regard to safety and security .
mr speaker , i would like to say to the hon minister in the office of the premier that she should not be selective in what she is doing in the province , especially on the cape flats .
mr speaker , the coalition government has once again proved - as they did last week - that they do not have the people to conduct a debate with the anc in the house .
one cannot talk about high living standards in the province when the people of manenberg , khayelitsha , mitchells plain and many other poor areas do not see what the hon premier claims is happening .
madam speaker , the hon minister of education is also hopping , skipping and jumping all over the peninsula , visiting schools thinking she is the spokesperson of the national minister of education .
can we , on the continent of africa , afford a situation where the cabinet does not include a single african person ?
mr speaker , although i know they like to call themselves the new np , it is always odd to sit on this side of the house and listen to the np hon members speaking about racism and apartheid .
my problem is that they are saying here today that the humiliation and degradation of past racist practices - and even present prejudices - should be ignored and swept under the carpet .
mr speaker , i understand when a fundamentally white party make those assertions ; i understand when a fundamentally white party that preserve white privilege call us bitter and twisted and harping on the past .
] the hon minister would not think twice about that either , because he would accept and respect the right of somebody with another tradition or desire to walk into the house .
mr speaker , the poor in south africa are becoming increasingly aware that members of the dp , and specifically my colleagues in these benches and our coalition partners , are working shoulder to shoulder with the poor every day .
mr speaker , what is more , while we are trying to accommodate these children appropriately to the best of our ability , the eastern cape government is receiving a central government subsidy for them .
one of the realities we had to accommodate was that there are absolute limits to the pace and scale at which a health service can be downsized without risking its total collapse .
mr speaker , it happens too often that we know who the criminals are , and yet the police remain powerless to act because people are overwhelmed by the bureaucracy brought about as a result of centralisation .
yes , as a relatively young and new member of the provincial parliament , i found it very difficult to concentrate on the meaninglessness of the opening address that the hon premier delivered on tuesday , 8 february 2000 .
despite substantial improvements , it is particularly worrying that structural difficulties in the economy still remain , not least of which is the stubbornly sluggish rate at which jobs are being created in the formal economy .
funding for improvements of conditions of service was previously provided to provinces as conditional grants from national revenue and were based on the outcome of the annual salary negotiations conducted in the public sector bargaining chamber .
mr speaker , i do not wish to be misunderstood when i talk of the flood of eastern cape residents to the western cape - they all , of course , have the constitutional and human right to choose their place of residence .
she was not only unable to provide us with obvious documents that we would have asked for - such as a programme of action for her office - but she also came with a very serious attitude problem .
i wish to appeal hon members on the other side of the house to act in a more sophisticated way and not to make that unfortunate remark about this side in this house again .
] mr g r strachan : mr speaker , i would firstly like to join my colleagues in thanking the chairperson of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling for his work in the committee .
we sympathise with them , but unless the standing committees meet regularly and work properly - and complimented by the right attitude from the ministers - we are doing the people of the province a disservice .
it is frustrating , mr speaker , and that is why i will today hopefully be able to announce a method of generating extra revenue that fulfils all the criteria of the financial fiscal and commission .
some of those themes still recur , but by and large - whatever the residues of those debates may be - the wisdom of the new system and the wisdom of fiscal discipline applied .
mr speaker , i am sure that the hon leader of the opposition knows far better , but i thank him for interrupting me because it gave me a chance to catch my breath .
as far as i am concerned , i walk down the same path as he does in seeing that representivity is applied in this province , whether it be in cabinet or any of the portfolios that i deal with .
it is not the anc 's exclusive reserve to declare an end to the bitterness of the past or their exclusive reserve to comment and cast judgement on racism .
as far as the empowerment of women is concerned , as well as their rights in many spheres , i am grateful to be able to say that this is an aspect which has gained a great deal of ground throughout south africa in recent times .
] the distribution of the notice boards will take place by way of a roadshow , in order to sensitise the staff of the administration to the objectives and activities of the various desks .
our key measurable outcome by the end of the 2000-01 financial year , that is , 31 march 2001 , is that these policy and supporting documents will be developed in order to give effect to a well-coordinated and integrated service .
as far as the key measurable outcome is concerned , by the end of the 2000-01 financial year we will have endeavoured to successfully implement the action or the steps to realise the individual objectives of each desk .
the statement that there is no overall business plan for this office is the other point that i want to rectify , as i said earlier , but i have to bring hon members a clear picture .
let me assure hon members that the business plan for poverty relief in the western cape that we envisage having in place shortly will inter alia also make provision for the new role of information technology .
the department of the hon minister must form part of the monthly meetings with all the ngos that work with violence against women to discuss policy and strategy , and to tackle the issues .
the department of social services say that it is now on the desk of the hon minister in the office of the premier , and we would very much like the commission for children now to be appointed .
there must be a link with the ngos to help the hon minister to develop a policy on women 's issues , and she must have a summit on women so that the policy can be owned by everybody .
history will record not what we say , but how we urgently address the enigma of gross inequality and breadline poverty evident in almost all aspects of our people 's lives .
] this will not only allow cabinet to interact with local communities outside the cape metropolitan area , but also for the communities to meet the ministers .
this brings me to the douglas report , a report that for the first time provides the provincial parliament with a good base on which to measure itself in carrying out the demanding tasks of this parliament .
the provincial government includes the provincial parliament , and the provincial parliament consists of all hon members in this house and the cabinet , and it includes the administrative staff attached to the parliament .
i therefore support wholeheartedly the idea that the r770 000 should be referred back to the rules committee and that we should re-evaluate the whole affair regarding what the support for standing committees should look like .
i know that budget statement no 2 lists a number of core functions , but i am of the view that those functions refer to the functions of the department and not to the functions of parliament itself .
this system would therefore include guarantees for all parties , but would mean , regarding the point made by the hon member mr king , that the portfolio committees would play the important role .
mr speaker , if that is the answer of the hon minister , could he explain why the newspapers quoted him as saying that the fires have been caused by arson and criminal negligence ?
mr speaker , to ask a non-sweetheart question , if anyone in this house were to have property on which alien vegetation were to grow , would the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs make an example of such an hon member ?
mr speaker , i want to know whether the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs agrees with the decision of the hon premier to delegate the matter to the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation .
( a ) where will the department get ( i ) the qualified forensic specialists to do this assessment and ( ii ) the qualified social workers to rehabilitate the sexual offenders ;
( 3 ) whether any programme is in place to notify the police about the releases and to work with them to secure the safety of the victims ; if not , why not ;
a number of issues are covered in the annual reports , such as the preferential procurement policy and problems round the delays in the implementation of the preferential procurement policy , and small and medium enterprises , but the reports have never been tabled .
( 1 ) on 5 march 1999 my department commented to the west coast district council that the conditions under which approval of the environmental management plan ( emp ) had been granted in 1993 had not been satisfactorily met .
apart from a single letter from legal representatives of the homeowners ' association requesting clarity on a particular matter regarding the extent of alien plant clearing , my department has had no further response from all the parties concerned since my department 's written submission , dated 17 february 2000 .
( 2 ) the compilation and implementation to the satisfaction of cape nature conservation of an environmental management plan for the grotto bay resort is a requirement of the original rezoning and subdivision authorisation granted by the then department of land development coordination .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs whether he thinks it is acceptable that it should take seven years before his department responds to clear transgressions of an environmental management plan .
this was the procedure prior to the western cape cultural commission becoming operational and the implementation of the western cape cultural commission and cultural council act , 1998 ( act 14 of 1998 ) that replaced act 65 of 1989 .
mr speaker , in response i would like to say that i mentioned in my reply earlier that this power to approve ad hoc funding or funding of cultural organisations could be delegated to an official .
clearly the officials will be present there and hon members will be able to see exactly what the reasons were for the delay and how the matter was implemented , and it will be open for public scrutiny there .
mr speaker , on a point of order : it is really not fair to expect the hon premier to answer an hon member 's six or eight questions about certain municipalities .
the question that the hon minister must answer today is whether the reason for that is the fact that it took place along the n1 and the n2 and where specifically it took place on those roads .
( 1 ) whether any conditions were put on planning approval for the grotto bay coastal estate ( farm 721 ) ; if so , ( a ) what conditions , ( b ) whether all these conditions have been met ;
i do see from the answer here that it is dependent upon a management plan - as the hon member well knows , having been on that committee - with regard to the development provisions in the act .
( 1 ) no , there was no shortage of police officers at manenberg police station and police officers were deployed on a 24-hour basis to dominate the specific geographic areas where gang violence needed combating .
( 3 ) whether a process of consultation with all the members of the provincial parliament regarding the appointment of the security guards was embarked upon ; if not , why not ; if so , what are the relevant details ; and
one often has a functional school that runs dry , while a dysfunctional school keeps its students because of community pressure not to move to allow the teacher : pupil ratio to drop .
mr speaker , the department has put together a committee of different departments , namely agriculture , transport and planning which meets on a weekly basis to try and facilitate the applications and the processing thereof as well .
( 1 ) let me start off by saying that there would surely be little expectation that i would be able to respond in detail to such a broad and far ranging set of questions in my oral reply .
but the tb control programme is well established and we have lifted the cure rate to the best figures in the country , very close to a 70 % first time cure , for which we were praised recently in a national minmec meeting .
the ppp project at groote schuur hospital is advancing well and the lease of the 125 beds to the uct medical company and rhone klinikum will be signed towards the end of next week .
mr speaker , i would like to know whether the hon minister of community safety is aware that some school children from cape town college were looking for lodgings because there is no protection on the trains .
we are doing so much that every weekend our matrons at the hospitals tell us that since we are giving azt to pregnant mothers we cannot keep up , and we are the only province doing it .
( 2 ) whether any municipalities in the province have established disability desks ; if not , why not ; if so , ( a ) how many municipalities and ( b ) how many of these desks are functional ; and
the coordination of the aids programme has always resorted within the department 's provincial aids management team , which meets twice a month and has brought about a substantial improvement in the management of the aids programme .
mr speaker , yes , we are acutely aware of the tensions and conflicts in the middle east and the fact that they might also have certain effects in south africa , especially amongst our jewish and muslim religious groups .
secondly , what we are sorting out now is the legacy that was left in health and social services from when the hon leader of the opposition had that job .
what we believe in this province is that one has to alleviate poverty , but it is a process that must take place in all departments - it is not just to be done from one desk .
i would like to ask the hon premier what the success of that venture was and , if such a need should again arise in the future , whether the provincial parliament would hesitate to embark on such a campaign ?
mr speaker , although the chairperson of the standing committee on finance did have a good session , i am not sure whether he has put on his rose-tinted spectacles , but i will get onto that in a moment .
it is one thing to state that olympic projects of r5 million have been carried over , but with the instance of any projects being carried over there is also an interest factor that we must bear in mind .
these include inter alia , firstly , the appropriation of funds that have become available to the province , that is , both from the national government and from the province 's own revenue sources .
a total amount of r175,99 million was allocated in the national adjustments estimate to be financed from higher than expected revenue collected at the national level and for additional unconditional allocations to the province .
in this instance a portion of casino bid fees received in 2000-01 has been allocated to fund - in two-stage payments ; one during this financial year and one during the next financial year - the installation cost of the system .
at the beginning of my speech i mentioned that accounting for the shifting of funds between and within votes or to follow the transfer of functions in terms of section 42 also falls under my authority .
whether , during the negotiations for the establishment of community police officers , he gave an undertaking to the national department of safety and security that he would not support the integration of the cpos into the saps ?
mr speaker , i am very glad that the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs has not taken the attitude of his colleague the hon member ms versfeld , of staying out of controversial issues .
as i mentioned in my budget speech , for the first time , with the assistance of external and internal participants , a formal fiscal policy document was drafted in advance of the finalisation of the new mtef budgets for the financial years 2000-01 and beyond .
madam chairperson , the main focus in this period has been on establishing a stable foundation from which we have been able to redeploy services and reprioritise expenditure qualitatively and quantitatively in order to obtain specific desired outputs and outcomes .
madam chairperson , i am committed to making sure that the western cape has a strong policy in this matter , and i give notice that i will introduce legislation in this regard , if necessary .
the turning point in the history of this nation six years ago made me emotional to the point of tears , because for the first time in my life i felt like a south african .
i remember when the casino at sun city was first built , and anybody who has followed the development of casinos in the country will know what social havoc was created in those working class areas .
neither can we go wild and start employing people crazily so that we get our staff rate up to 60 % or 70 % from the 56 % or so that it is .
for instance , there was no talk on airport taxes at all , to the best of my knowledge , before i came up with the idea - certainly not at any of the meetings of the budget council or anywhere else .
today , for the same geographic area with a much greater population , we have some 127 000 police officers , and this figure is declining by the day in accordance with the eventual " design total " of 120 000 to 122 000 officers .
the result is that the countrywide support of the new np since the 1999 election has declined drastically , while in the western cape , too , it has lost a great deal of support to the dp and to the anc , which is now comfortably ahead .
it is a visible sign of policing and coupled , of course , with the use of cameras throughout our city and hopefully a more extensive use of cameras , i think that this will bear fruit over the longer term .
often they are the people who are overlooked , because so much attention is focused on the sport alone and not on the administrators who are responsible for the success achieved in that sport .
it is well and good to hear support for the sport federation , but the focus should be to unorganise what has been done to those who are already organised and well-resourced .
we are glad to learn that there is movement in respect of the facilities , such as upgrading the athlone stadium , but i feel that more attention should be paid to hiv / aids .
i recently visited willows primary school in heideveld where i was greatly impressed by the excellence and dedication of both pupils and teachers , who have established a successful ballroom and latin american dance team .
i think we need to capitalise on this and we need to start looking at how we can utilise the european winters in the south african summers , so that some of the european athletes can come and train here in our summers .
it is , indeed , heartening to note that the province is getting r8 million over two financial years to ensure that our people have a great facility at which to play the sport that they know and love .
having said that , many of the schools do not have adequate facilities , especially in the disadvantaged and other areas where there has been a mass influx of people and where they had to create infrastructure in a short period of time .
i have to inform the house that in terms of rule 12 ( 1 ) of the standing rules today , tuesday , 8 february 2000 at 11 : 45 has been determined as the time and date for the opening of the provincial parliament .
i am proud to say that one of the schools which qualified , notwithstanding the fact that it had been adversely affected by the august tornado , was silverstream secondary school in manenberg .
mr speaker , i am also proud to announce that the three-day visit to upper austria resulted in the finalisation of a number of joint projects in support of the rdp and gear in the western cape .
mr speaker , it is increasingly obvious that our province has a great deal to be proud of , both nationally and internationally , but there are also some things we are not so proud of .
by reaching out to the youth , the western cape government , through project chrysalis , will influence the lives of current and future generations who may ordinarily be headed for a life of crime and violence .
i have had a discussion with mr eugene daniels , the excellent manager of the safe schools programme , and our shared conclusion is that pumping more resources into voorbrug 's safety programme will not improve the situation .
we have all had the experience of driving around working class environments and seeing large numbers of young people in school uniforms walking around the streets throughout the morning , either arriving at school late or leaving early .
mr chairperson , another practical step we took to establish time on task , was to compile a detailed syllabus planner for the most widely taken matric subjects this year .
khanya aims to equip all schools with a full educational and administrative it system , as well as a full audio-visual media system , and to adapt the educational programme fully for the utilisation of this technology .
the western cape 's method of implementing norms and standards policy re-emphasises race and class , misjudges what the true economic and social indicators are and overrides all of its own criteria by using crass bureaucratic tidiness .
madam chairperson , an urgent investigation will have to be launched into the process followed to determine and categorise the national norms and standards for the funding of schools .
- the concept of single ward levies , which were introduced in some institutions in november 1999 , will be extended to allow more patients the benefit of single bed wards on payment of a levy .
i think all provinces are ready to spend this money on their behalf , and that all provinces will support me and will probably raise this at the coming minmec meeting at the end of the week .
although i agree that we should be organised better , i was under the impression that the national interministerial committee on aids was the body to spearhead the battle against the disease .
the charter tabulates 12 rights , which are those to a healthy and safe environment , to access to health care , to confidentiality and privacy , to informed consent , to complain , to continuity of care , to refuse treatment , and so on .
in the 2000-01 allocation an amount of r2,3 million has been allocated to this project , but these interventions , as we all must understand , must run parallel with antipoverty interventions and those aimed at employment creation .
funding is paid through an ngo , which accepts the responsibility for coordinating a network of volunteers deployed at police stations , and not only volunteers but also social service workers from our department .
mr chairperson , in the past , if one was beaten by one 's husband and one reported the matter to the police , they said , " it is not our problem ; it is a domestic matter .
the hon minister in the office of the premier , who is the responsible minister , has assured us that the process is back on track and we look forward to hearing the results in due course .
in that regard , i would like to convey my sincere congratulations to ms petersen , ms follentine , dr sutcliffe and the whole department , because we can truly see some progress there , and we are very proud of that .
we have 616 early childhood development centres and 151 community centres , for example , and we are spending r88 million just on old-age services , including r76 million on the 140 old-age care centres and r11 million on community centres for the aged .
that is an area in which we are neither decelerating the institutional model nor accelerating the community-based model fast enough , and it has to go down as one critique that we have to make of the department .
our contractual commitments in respect of projects already under construction and the reduction in funding from the national department of housing means that this province will not be able to initiate any new developments until 2003 .
the integrated serviced land project has now delivered 17 500 houses , 485 classrooms , including 15 new schools , 8 new or upgraded health centres , 8 halls , 3 libraries and 4 sportsfields - and there are additional projects still under construction .
to date - and i want hon members to take note of this - 3 915 potential beneficiaries have already been processed and 3 050 families have moved in since the first houses were completed in april 1999 .
approval has already been given for the transfer of such land in places such as crossroads , brown 's farm , heinz park , du noon , wesbank , paarl , pelican park , elands bay and still bay east , also known as melkhoutfontein .
madam chairperson , although the problems that i have highlighted sometimes make one despair , it is essential that we do not lose hope and that we continually come up with new initiatives in order to realise our goals .
this year will also see the approval of a programme to assist persons who qualify for subsidies in all respects , but are presently unable to access subsidies because they have undeveloped property registered in their names .
i think we need to respect the desire expressed by the leader of the house today , and i would therefore appreciate it if hon members could just curb their speaking between speeches and so on .
the western cape government must adopt and implement policies to actively promote and maintain the welfare of the people of the western cape , including policies aimed at achieving the following - ...
madam chairperson , i want to place my contribution this afternoon within the context of housing vis--vis the whole question of urbanisation and the realities and problematic situation relating to urbanisation , as well as the challenges awaiting us in the future .
i also want to refer to the cabinet 's adjustment of the conditions for qualification for cmip projects approved on 31 january 2000 , since cmip projects may now be used or employed for internal services , including community facilities .
if there is genuinely a need , the district transformation forums will have to consider - and i will also have to consider - giving municipalities the necessary approval , in exceptional cases , to make appointments .
another matter close to my heart is the tendency of salga - the national body representing local government - to want to centralise , which is in conflict with the constitution and with their own constitution .
this morning when i addressed almost 1 000 policemen , they told me the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation is the worst minister they have ever had , so he must be quiet .
from this side of the house i would also like to say a big thank you to the department and oom faan , who not only wears very attractive shirts in the standing committee meetings , but also always produces very good documentation .
in the survey that has just been published by the hsrc , 48 % of the people in this province believe that local government is not performing and they are not receiving the delivery they should be .
it is a party that is using a new form of black peril to win rich , mostly white , voters from the new np , and also people such as the editor of die burger .
over the past financial year , much of the department 's time and most of its activities have revolved around the implementation of the western cape planning and development act , which was promulgated on 7 april 1999 .
based on comments received , the policy will be revised where necessary before being submitted to cabinet and the standing committee for ratification , after which it will be promulgated as official provincial policy .
the rural areas act ( house of representatives ) , 1987 ( act 9 of 1987 ) has been repealed and replaced by the transformation of certain rural areas act , 1998 ( act 94 of 1998 ) .
] my information , for the benefit of the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation - we know who the minister was at the time , and he is sitting here - is that the decision went to the cabinet ...
i wonder whether the funds available to complete this plan will not be wasted , as the area the plan deals with will also fall within the new greater knysna municipality .
when , however , one presents statistics for the provincial administration in its totality , that picture will be skewed consistently by the fact that many in the coloured and african population groups are employed in the lower ranks of the administration .
i attended exhibitions at the museums at genadendal and caledon and saw first-hand how transformation of museum exhibitions can make a profound difference to the way in which communities perceive themselves and even how a community defines itself .
the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism is the de facto premier , the hon minister of education is the pro darling of the cabinet and the hon minister of health runs the largest single department in the province .
] when we go to meetings on the ukuvuka campaign and the hon premier , who is on the board , cannot make it , then the hon minister of environmental affairs and tourism does not go in his place .
i have nothing against the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation being there , but it is very strange to us that the hon minister who is dealing with these issues is sidelined in the process .
the hon member mr winde pointed out earlier today - and i want to mention it too - that the cmc spends thousands of rands on workshops in communities regarding river issues , clean water , catchment management and so on .
the two major threats to the environment are , on the one hand , industrial waste , backed by big money , and on the other hand , unfettered growth in the area of informal housing , backed by the national government .
while the hon minister talks about the commissioner for the environment bridging planning and the environment , i think the whole training that needs to be pursued by the department is critical for the notion of biosphere existence .
we are on the threshold of the implementation of the new western cape nature conservation board and i think that this is a wonderful opportunity for them to enter into a private partnership so that they can look after the harbours .
if one looks at the budget for environmental affairs and considers that of the r59 million , r52 million goes to the western cape nature conservation board , one can see that we are left with very little .
mr speaker , on a point of order : i would like you to give a ruling on whether it is parliamentary for the hon member to make a direct accusation against another hon member .
in order to withdraw these funds from our provincial revenue fund , though , the national and provincial constitutions determine that it can only be done in one of two ways : either in terms of an appropriation in an appropriation act , for which debates on the bill for the 2000-01 financial year are currently in progress , or as a direct charge provided for in the constitution or in a provincial act .
a comprehensive five-year priority delivery programme has been developed in line with these core strategies and each year a service delivery programme is prepared , scheduling key measurable objectives that have to be achieved to ensure that the provincial policy goals are met .
" i said in reply that the new np / dp unholy coalition did not have the political will to address the problems of the poor people in this province .
the smme sector should be targeted for public works contracts , not only for affirmative action purposes but also because this is an incentive structure for the implementation of labour-intensive construction methods without reference to investment on yellow machines .
it seems to me as if the pressure exerted by the sandveld potato farmers has had the effect that the hon minister did not listen to what the poor brown and black people along the west coast and at lamberts bay and elands bay said .
i therefore want to ask the hon minister of transport and works to visit the west coast region together with the national minister of transport in order to carry out an investigation into the state of the rural roads .
it took me 45 minutes to drive 22 km. some of my colleagues will be able to confirm that i am not one of those people who travel very slowly on a road .
the problem we will face is that our truck drivers and companies will license their vehicles in other provinces , because this province is becoming too expensive for them to operate their vehicles in .
i raised the problem that there was nothing in the estimates of revenue and expenditure that referred to how key outcomes in works were going to meet the objective of empowering small and medium enterprises .
as hon members are aware , the policy document has been placed and we expect that all the representations will be in by the end of april 2000 ; after that we shall be able to continue to draw up the regulations for toll-roads .
i would rather like him to simply say that we are not doing the right work ; that we are not doing the things we ought to do , if that is so .
one of the things that i would like to say to the hon member mr ramatlakane , and the hon member mr fransman as well , is that we do not look after only a certain section of the people in the western cape .
we cannot set a precedent that a minister may leave his bench in the middle of his reply , because the moment that he leaves his seat i assume that he has stopped speaking .
madam chairperson , as we enter the new millennium , the key challenge facing our nation is to create jobs for our people and to prepare our job seekers for the type of jobs that will be created .
madam chairperson , the department will be instrumental in bringing about the location of the cape manufacturing advice centre ( mac ) , which will be an extremely important institution to enhance the competitiveness of local manufacturing firms .
this process unfortunately takes on average six months from the day the application is brought to the provincial state land disposal committee - run by the national government - until the day the title deed has been finally endorsed .
the western cape provincial state land disposal committee has agreed that the properties should be endorsed in the name of the province and the national minister of land affairs will be requested to issue the certificates as soon as possible .
because we here in the western cape have a government that looks after its people and takes trouble to make the western cape work , despite the negative criticism that is so often hurled at us from the opposition benches .
i would also like to thank the hon minister , but in a constructive spirit i would suggest to him that there is a difference between a speech which raises critical political issues , and a progress report .
this can only be achieved with the total buy-in of the surrounding community to act as policemen , and the buy-in of the respective entrepreneurs who need to assume full responsibility for the businesses they are running .
this is very clear from the white paper on the development and promotion of tourism published in 1996 by the national department and from the world travel and tourism council report of september 1998 .
that reason is to be found in the muscular liberalism adhere to by the hon minister and his party - a liberalism which only benefits the economically and socially powerful and has no place for those who struggle .
while the other institutions are geared towards the promotion of economic growth , i believe the pdc is very well-placed to deal with developmental issues and social issues not purely from an economic growth perspective .
today i will demonstrate the progress of the chief directorate in the past six months in these focus areas , the problems we anticipate for agriculture in the next few months , and the challenges we have taken on .
financial pressure will compel the rest of the agriculturists to adapt to the new technology , or even to leave agriculture , but usually by that time newer technology has already ensured a new cycle .
it is really encouraging to follow an hon minister who knows his field and has a passion for the farmers and for the new farmers who will establish themselves .
madam chairperson , minimum wages will not be a threat to the western cape but i want the national minister of labour to realise that agriculture is a unique job creation mechanism in the economy of south africa .
i am concerned about the fact that the deputy minister of agriculture and land affairs can say that the farmers will get a rebate on diesel when they create employment ; as if we have to be threatened to do that .
for the information of the hon member mr isaacs , if an hon member approves the vote in principle but still has a query , his or her party can object to that vote or accept it .
we understand that they have been on a contract basis for over 15 years and we wish our request noted that the status of these supernumeraries needs to be urgently addressed at the bargaining council .
i am proud to say that one of the schools which qualified , notwithstanding the fact that it had been adversely affected by the august tornado , was silverstream secondary school in manenberg .
mr speaker , i am also proud to announce that the three-day visit to upper austria resulted in the finalisation of a number of joint projects in support of the rdp and gear in the western cape .
mr speaker , it is increasingly obvious that our province has a great deal to be proud of , both nationally and internationally , but there are also some things we are not so proud of .
by reaching out to the youth , the western cape government , through project chrysalis , will influence the lives of current and future generations who may ordinarily be headed for a life of crime and violence .
the implications of the amendment bill are that we must make alternative transport available in the declared areas where certain minibus taxis can no longer operate , and that the alternative transport will receive the necessary protection .
mr speaker , negotiations should be continued at all times , because failure to resolve this issue could ignite a war in communities , over which none of us would have any control .
if one compares the 102 permit holders in guguletu with the 561 permit holders in khayelitsha , the question must be asked : can the minibus operators satisfy all the commuters , all the people that need transport ?
mr speaker , i want to thank the hon premier , the members of the cabinet and of the standing committee , hon members who participated in the debate and all the other hon members here for their support .
mr speaker , you know and i know that firearms - and the cases i have listed here today attest to this - play a tremendous role in committing crime , particularly on the cape flats .
mr speaker , our duty is not just to be the strong arm of the state but also to recognise that the solutions for all problems ultimately lie in the hearts of people .
if we are lucky , there is one person available , but he goes home , takes his cellphone with him and leaves a note on the door , " in the event of an emergency , phone the following number " .
i am therefore of the opinion that you should try to arrange , through your chief whip , to have this particular matter debated by way of an ordinary private member 's motion on the next sitting day .
they desperately need to register voters , but for the information of the hon minister of finance and development planning , no matter how many times they try to register voters , they will not vote for them .
] the second step is that one is expected , once one has become a member of those gangs , to do something to prove that one is fully a member of those gangs .
i want to take some time to quote more fully from the letters that the hon members mr ismail and mr jelly bean referred to , because they have omitted the key parts of those letters .
one of the letters from which dr barnard read in the standing committee yesterday states that within one day of the request going out in this province , 430 volunteers from the public service had already volunteered .
from that statement it is quite clear that the national government was trying to save the taxpayers significant amounts of money , while at the same time engendering a spirit of volunteerism and national service amongst our public servants .
i think your ruling is unfair in the sense that most of the ministers sitting there have changed their portfolios and do not have the authority to report on the questions that we are asking .
i would like to know from the hon premier what steps were taken to ensure that public servants who volunteered to assist with voter registration were actually present on all three days of the first voter registration weekend ?
madam chairperson , seeing that the hon member knows where the money comes from , i would like to know from the hon minister of housing how many people were paid out of the r30 192,91 that came from his department ?
as a result of negotiations that were under way with the trade unions and the bargaining council , the posts could not be advertised but they do appear under " staff " or " management administration " on the books .
it could not have been a large number if we spent r3 795 , but the good news is that it was not money from the budget but money that was transferred back into our budget .
i do not think it has ever come before a house that we have one bill , where we expect 12 ministers to respond to the finance , the total of r199 000 .
on vote 9 in schedule 1 , mr m l fransman : madam chairperson , i am shocked - and the hon minister of agriculture said this - that there is very little money for agriculture in the western cape .
madam chairperson , there is a saying , " a fool can answer more questions than a wise man can ever answer , " and i do not think that is a very intelligent question .
madam chairperson , if , as was motivated earlier , the precise aim of this allocation was to avoid teachers ' being used for voter registration , could the hon minister explain to us why her department had to spend money on this ?
madam chairperson , there are many officials employed by the department of education and i do not know how the hon member mr ozinsky came to the conclusion that it was teachers who were involved .
madam chairperson , if , on receipt of the details , the hon minister is not happy with the information provided to her , how will she reverse her agreement to authorise this amount of money ?
madam chairperson , my last question to the hon minister , arising from her reply , is : is she conceding that there may be points at which some things supersede the need for teachers to be in their classrooms ?
as far as possible , we would like that to happen , but the hon ministers can make their own arrangements for other hon ministers to respond to their questions , in the same way that we do for questions .
at this stage i should want to argue - and the hon premier began to move in that direction - that crime is one of the great evils in the western cape , together with one or two other things .
was there to any extent any - that hon member should put his name on the speaker 's list if he wants to speak - formula included which would give us a greater priority in relation to others ?
madam chairperson , we have had the response of the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation that it was in the interest of democracy , and because the national government did not want to spend the money .
i would like to respond to it by saying that if i discover that there are irregularities after i have received the details , the officials responsible will be made to refund the state and the taxpayer .
] my answer to the hon member mr strachan is that this registration was clearly before the last election and as i was not yet in office i could not authorise the expenditure .
these are mothers and fathers who either themselves were the victims of that cruel system , or who had to say farewell to young boys at stations as we were called upon to defend that system .
it is right to have more police patrols on the n2 from the airport , but it is better to accelerate the process of turning squatter camps into residential areas with a community spirit and an emerging local economy .
the anc want to see a plan that shows seriousness and shifts more police into the areas where gangsterism thrives - police who can assist local authorities to regain control over housing stock .
yesterday , when he spelt out his intentions for this government this year , the hon premier spoke not only as the first citizen of this province , but also as the provincial leader of the da .
there can be no doubt that we are serious about providing the best education in south africa for our pupils , and there is no doubt that we have the best public school system in south africa .
mr speaker , in the interest of agriculture and the people of the rural communities , i want to call on president mbeki to repudiate the statement made by the national minister of labour .
the issue is that if those hon members think they represent democrats and that they represent their constituents , that representation is one of failed development , failed promises , corruption and an inability to listen to ...
the western cape department of education could do nothing to rein this man in , because of the ridiculous labour regimes devised by this anc government , which is not so gradually strangling this country .
mr speaker , if the opening of the provincial parliament before that of the national parliament was an attempt by the da strategists to upstage the national parliament and the president , it has failed .
i believe that we should trumpet our victories and we should be proud of this province , but my fear is that the endemic problems that we have in the province will be overlooked .
they prey on sensation and are so trapped in their own negativity and in the mentality of the hon leader of the opposition who threatens to revert to struggle politics , the streets and the trenches .
it appears that the hon member ms rossouw has implied that the anc might have been responsible for telling people that if they did not vote for the anc they would be murdered .
the issue that the hon minister of education has failed to tell the house about is that the development has been stopped because mr noludwe and his group are demanding that the rdp hold an agm .
the article says that bongani zondi draws two salaries a month - one as an anc local councillor and one as a teacher - although he has not set foot in school for 17 months .
sir , last year , when the national government announced that it was going to close specialist police units throughout the country , including the stock theft units , i arranged a discussion between agri western cape and the hon minister of community safety .
mr speaker , this government , through its silence on issues of exploitation and its constant deriding of labour legislation which seeks to protect the most vulnerable , are giving comfort to those people who perpetrate these exploitative practices .
the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling , having considered the subject of the western cape adjustments appropriation bill [ b1-2001 ] , referred to it , begs to report as follows :
are you therefore suggesting that it is in order , where there is multiparty agreement in a standing committee , for the chairperson of that standing committee to be able unilaterally to change the report before it is presented to the house ?
madam chairperson , i would like to know what action the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism will take if there were no kmos for the allocation of this funding as laid out in the national legislation ?
madam chairperson , the camera network in cape town , as the hon member knows , was rolled out by business against crime and there was , to the best of my knowledge , no direct funding from this government for business against crime for infrastructure .
on 30 may 2000 discussions took place with the top structure - comm selebi , the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation and the hon minister of transport and works - in regard to the acquisition of manpower .
] i ask this question because in my opinion it is very important to ask each of us who participates in politics , where we stand in regard to this violence and the human lives that we are losing .
i know that the hon minister is not in a hurry to close places where the taxis are operating because he is aware that the violence could spill over into other areas and that this could have a ripple effect .
we all know that the reason why people have to buy a car using a cousin 's name is the fact that credit bureaux do not permit people who are not employed to obtain finance .
mr speaker , i should like to thank the hon minister of transport and works and the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation for the in-depth discussions with all role-players which began last week .
i believe that it is for good governance , and with my colleague being in charge of transport in this province , it is only good and proper government that this matter should be debated in the house .
there is a justifiable temptation for us to focus all our priorities on restoring peace immediately and , most importantly , our commuters want that and our communities want peace .
the taxi associations take decisions at a meeting and the following day they say that they were not aware of those decisions or they are no longer interested in them and they place other things on the agenda .
mr speaker , the position is that when we had the meeting last week with the national commissioner , he begged me not to close down the taxi ranks until we had exhausted all avenues of negotiation .
the real construction work commences when the builders get back in january 2001 , but already there are enquiries from potential clients stretching over the first few years , including fifa and the international pr convention in 2006 .
sunwest had submitted a proposal to build a boutique convention centre and they proposed spending r140 million on the centre , offered to operate it and encouraged having a hotel on the site .
however , we also acknowledge , and by the same token we expect the cabinet to acknowledge , the constitutionally enshrined duties of the provincial parliament , and especially its standing committees , to oversee the cabinet and its actions .
the building and development of the convention centre in itself creates new job opportunities for professional businessmen but at the same time will address the problem of job creation in the labour sphere , and there is a great need for that in the western cape .
i do not think that the hon member should publicly allege something like that if he actually does not have the type of proof one needs to make allegations of that kind .
the unauthorised expenditure in respect of subsidies to welfare agencies amounting to r2 961 383,61 which was paid in excess of the national norm and for which ex post facto approval by treasury could not be obtained , was considered .
( 2 ) notes with appreciation that , against the background of increased gang activities on the cape flats , those who were arrested are being associated with gang activities ; and
mr speaker , any party in government , at whatever level , that deals with legislation and does not do so to its own benefit , is a stupid party and should stop functioning .
i really make an earnest appeal for one and all of us to leave the judiciary alone in future , and , particularly , since we are presumed to be sensible people , permit them to do their duty .
we cannot allow the concept of an independent judiciary to be seized upon conveniently by apartheid era judges to elevate them above the winds of change sweeping the rest of our society .
what i also find astounding is that the dp do not refer to the fact that it was their leader 's father who , as a judge of the high court , was responsible for the hanging of a liberation fighter .
they do not have the decency to say that the anc spokesperson actually said that he was misquoted and that the anc had never made the statements they were alleged to have made .
] if they now say that it is new np judges sitting on the benches , why do they not take the arrogant step and remove them , and replace them with people who , according to them , would act in a transformationally correct way ?
the dp has the power and ability to consolidate the white opposition , and the dp will humiliate the new np and speed up its demise if the new np tries to ride both horses .
we asked the human rights commission that we should not rush into it now , and that we should try to establish whether a prima facie case exists before investigating allegations of racism in the banks .
sir , the interesting thing is - and i listened carefully to the three speakers - that they have outlined the problems but they have not come up with one solution , not one concrete proposal .
what goes closely with this is that many of these businesses who come to us want a donation - they do not want an investment - and there is a huge difference between the two .
however , in view of the urgency of the matter , the director-general of the provincial administration , contrary to the tender board 's recommendation , gave approval for the purchase of the reprographic equipment to the value of r2 287 980,27 .
we find that in many cases they used moneys allocated for other purposes in their general rates account in order to lower rates for the privileged communities , whereas they milked electricity and other services .
that is a self-evident truth that the dp once again , in its quest to preserve white privilege , cannot fathom and cannot understand and would not understand .
non-metropolitan area but specifically in the metropolitan area - to get our valuation rolls on the table as soon as possible .
it is also regrettable to read in the newspaper that certain people in the epping industrial area are telling the city of cape town that they will withdraw their rates because cape town does not provide a service there .
i believe it should be the speaker 's prerogative to be able to do that because circumstances can arise where there may not be unanimity on both sides of the house and it could be embarrassing .
earlier today a charge of assault with intent to cause serious bodily harm was laid by a 39-year old brown man , mr felix september , against the owner of the farm swart water , mr gert oosthuizen , at the albertinia police station .
that job creation , meeting basic needs of the poor , transforming the organs of government , generating of own revenue and the redistribution of land be considered to provide a clearer relationship between national outcomes and provincial outcomes .
however , if one looks at the weight of the evidence , while i accept the word of the hon minister , i think that bearing in mind the dignity of the house i cannot permit such a remark to pass .
in this regard , since a totalisator operator licence and a series of totalisator premises licences have already been issued to the western province gambling club , one of which is specifically related to the race course , it is clear that a race course and race course premises licence are superfluous .
although i have dealt mainly with the regulatory aspects of the bill as it pertains to casinos and gambling , there are other important issues relating to the streamlining of the licensing procedures in the horse-racing industry .
let me say , mr speaker , that suddenly , when i had obtained information from the convenco website , the beautiful curriculum vitae of the hon minister and his interests disappeared off the website today !
" the very reason i am sitting here today is the type of matters we are dealing with here today , and the type of nonsense that is brought up by the hon members on that side of the house .
does it mean that the bull-terrier will bite one 's children or the aeroplane will crash or , for that matter , that all bull-terriers are vicious and one is always at risk in so far as all bull-terriers are concerned ?
] and it is not a white president or minister of health who is refusing to administer anti-retrovirals to victims of rape or pregnant women , most of whom , given south africa 's demographics , are black people .
by " morality " i mean that if i am opposed to , say , theft and my child is involved in theft , i will not stand back for the sake of my child and suddenly have nothing to say about theft .
that the house congratulates mr saag jonker from oudtshoorn on his designation as the western cape 's farmer of the year and wishes him the best of luck and success with his big and dynamic role as agricultural leader in the province .
( 1 ) congratulates corporate institutions such as pick ' n pay who have been proactive in the institution of a scheme to provide azt to rape victims and their employees who have been diagnosed as hiv-positive ; and
] as long as the anc persists in demonising white farmers , in other words condemning all white farmers as racists , this will destroy the very good employer / worker relationship that often does exist on south african farms .
introducing a risk management instrument for farmers along the lines of the canadian net income stabilisation account , which has enabled relatively unsubsidised canadian farmers to compete with their highly subsidised us neighbours and eu farmers ;
vote 8 - trade , industry and tourism ( auditor-general 's report [ pr 16 / 2000 - page 3 , paragraph 2.2.1 ( b ) ] ) : western cape tender board directives not adhered to : unauthorised expenditure , r1 088 417,40
( f ) the impact on the security industry in general and particularly on small , medium and macro enterprises as well as job creation in the industry and the method that was followed in allocating contracts ; and
the creation of the nhls as the preferred provider of laboratory services to the public sector and as an organisation available to provide services to the private sector may also contravene the competition act .
in general he may indeed express his opinion , because the way in which the debates are conducted in the committees and during the committee stage , allows hon members to speak about what they experienced .
i would just like to dwell on this for a moment , mr speaker , because what is happening is that , i cannot remember whether it is four or five , needed schools in underprivileged areas will not be built .
however , before i commence speaking - and i would like to say this immediately after the speech of the hon member mr strachan - i want to say unequivocally that this side of the house condemns any form of racism .
if the hon member mr dugmore acknowledges the independence of the judiciary , he will agree with me that when the sales to which i was so vehemently opposed took place - and i agree with him ...
i would like us to go there and visit them and then come back and have a discussion with representatives from those areas and see if we cannot find a solution to the problem .
i am not putting it exactly as he did , but the intention is that everyone should be happy in the knowledge that the western cape government is a government for all the people in the province .
they are getting richer while the poor have nothing to measure their benefits by because they are getting poorer , and those hon members are still saying this is a free province and they should feel at home !
langa , lwandle , khayelitsha and the rest of the townships stick out like a sore thumb in the " prosperous province in which no one is left behind " - to quote the words of the hon premier .
everyone knew that an executive committee was going to be appointed , but a day or two before the election of the committee the anc said that they were not going to participate in the executive committee of the unicity .
i want to ask the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism what the response of his party would have been if the president , comrade thabo mbeki , were to appoint an official in his office to run a voter registration campaign .
if the coalition is not divided , why did the sunday times report that he called his ministers to a special meeting , and a few hours later the hon minister of social services and poverty relief was dismissed .
my attitude and that of my party is that each and every hon member of this house , from whichever party , ultimately has the mandate to improve the lot of the people of the western cape .
madam speaker , what i found striking in the opening address of the hon premier is the fact that he on more than one occasion called on all our citizens to think like winners .
before i left the new np , i sat down and had a discussion with the hon premier and the former minister of social services and poverty relief , the deputy leader of the new np in his office .
i said to them , " gentlemen , you will leave me no option , because the party is moving to the right and you know i have always been left in my politics .
the inherent racism of the dp 's liberalism and the way they apply it has effectively created a gap between people that should be united in the province , but are not united at the moment .
the counselling interface also gives us the opportunity to promote the use of condoms and the effective treatment of sexually transmitted diseases further to limit the spread of the disease .
the early detection of hiv infection and the provision of appropriate counselling services will assist in reducing the spread of the disease and help to cushion the social impact associated with living with hiv .
consequently , no provision could be made for inflation on consumables such as blood and blood products , drugs and surgical sundries and there was also no funding to cover the steady upward drift of the wage bill .
in doing so he reaffirmed the conviction of every member on this side of the house of the coalition government 's non-commitment to addressing the plight and living conditions of the rural poor .
madam speaker , in my first speech to the house , i thanked the president and the national minister for agriculture and land affairs and congratulated them on the fresh breeze of renewal that was blowing through south africa , thanks to them .
he needs to tell his colleague that the treatment that the black people receive - when they stand up and talk about it , he closes his ears - is the same as the treatment they received .
] when we objected to this as an infringement of the rights of people in terms of their participation , the new np followed an extraordinary procedure here to authorise the unauthorised expenditure .
the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism spent some time here yesterday attacking the anc and its programme that aims to improve the lives of the poor people .
that the house congratulates the western stormers on their victory on saturday , 26 february 2000 , and in particular commends breyton paulse for his outstanding performance , and further wishes them success for the rest of the super 12 rugby competition .
with a 9,8 % population share and with 14 % to 15 % of the country 's gdp generated in the western cape , it constitutes a small , yet highly significant segment of the south african national economy .
the provincial treasury committee plays a most important part in the budget process and i wish to thank my colleague the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism and the director-general who , together with me , are the members of that committee .
let us read yesterday 's sunday times , and hon members will see what transformation in the national department of correctional services meant - jobs for family , friends and cronies , irrespective of qualifications or competence .
today we recognise that we have moved away from the propaganda that the western cape is " being punished " , to a notion of fiscal discipline that i think everyone across the board in the country and in the house has praised .
strong emphasis is put on cultivating an environment that will enhance and support the new management model to accommodate our distinctive needs and circumstances in the best interest of the western cape and all its people .
both the public service act and the employment equity act have given new perspectives and clear direction to transformation and reform processes and highlighted the need to tailor-make the national prescripts to the unique needs of our province .
the expansion of our human resource capacity such as additional funding for bursaries and the more productive use of our cape administrative academy at kromme rhee are but a few examples of how we can improve even more .
and even if there are those who do not believe in god , how could they not want all the support they can get to improve the lot of the people of this province ?
for these reasons , and as a matter of political rights , steps should be taken to ensure that the most marginalised , poor , unemployed and battered women have a meaningful opportunity to better their lives .
we have heard some very significant input from the relevant hon minister in this regard and i am particularly sympathetic to her plight when she points out the delays at the national government level in implementing policy .
i think we will continue to insist on that , because we want this administration to be the colour of this province , or representative of this province , so we will always look at that .
in addition , the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling had a recommendation saying that the hon minister was not supposed to be given this money because she did not have a business plan .
while the 2000-01 budget provides for the continued delivery of most services , additional funding must also be provided for implementing special projects for the protection , promotion and enhancement of the rights of persons with disabilities .
according to research , our neighbour mozambique is considered to have the best-performing economy in africa , better than south africa 's , but what is threatening mozambique 's growth is aids - and now , of course , the floods that they have experienced .
i agree with the participation of a committee of parliament in international agreements - i really do - but he would know , from the dp component on the cabinet , that it is an executive function .
municipal ordinance , 1974 , amendment bill [ b 4-2000 ] ( in accordance with standing rule 147 ( 3 ) ( b ) bill declared urgent measure by premier and published in provincial gazette for 7 days ) .
before highlighting specific points in this vote , i wish to take this opportunity to first thank the parliamentary support team for the excellent service and support they have rendered us as members .
madam chairperson , i would like to place my contribution regarding vote 2 - provincial parliament in the context of two of the nine strategic policy goals of the western cape government , as approved by cabinet in july 1999 .
yes , we have to a large extent succeeded in improving the quality and accessibility of the services delivered by various departments of the provincial administration but not those of the provincial parliament .
i looked at this question and while i was studying it , i decided that the questions answered by the hon minister should be measured against seven of the eight principles of batho pele .
mr speaker , i would like to know why the national minister of education took the hon leader of the opposition with him to schools without consulting our provincial minister of education ?
in the western cape the relevant legislation to create the tribunal has not yet been passed as serious concerns have been expressed regarding the constitutionality of a number of provisions of similar legislation passed by other provinces .
if the proper procedures were followed , and if we as a parliament had the opportunity of looking at these reports , we could have dealt with many of the issues that have been debated in the house .
mr speaker , the reality is - and the hon minister of finance and development planning should admit it - that it is on the table today because the interpellation is on the table today .
whether there are traffic training centres in the province ; if so , ( a ) where are they situated and ( b ) what results are achieved at these centres ; if not , whether such centres can be established at schools ?
( 2 ) in terms of the draft coastal policy planned for the western cape province , the property falls within a sensitive dunes area and it is assigned buffer zone status , being within an existing conservation area , on the draft map .
( 4 ) what is the overall cost to the province for ( i ) the failure of the successful consortium meeting the conditions of the tender and for ( ii ) the litigation ;
the debate has led , inter alia , to our partnership with khula enterprise finance ltd to form the new cape fund aimed at providing equity finance for businesses from previously disadvantaged communities .
mr speaker , it is a great pity that the hon minister of agriculure , property management and works first tried to give a definition of human brutality and then said that no human brutality occurred here .
transformation is a lengthy process , and it is not possible at this moment to give a 3-year projection , because there will be upward mobility which will achieve better work opportunities for everyone in the province .
with the passing out parade of the most recent batch of cpo recruits last friday in oudtshoorn , it brings the total of cpos trained by my department to over 450 in little over a year .
with the policy of closing down schools that have fewer than 25 children it has been very important to try to organise alternative arrangements , but adequate time is given for people to object .
sir , the hon mec or minister - he can choose whatever he would like to be - said to the house in march 2000 that the projects then outstanding were to the value of r3,7 ...
mr speaker , the reason for my bringing this to the attention of the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works is that the people have been dealing with this discrimination for more than a year now .
mr speaker , firstly , i make no apology for the fact that when compared with the other eight provinces , the western cape is the best run province .
when this function was devolved , we lobbied government , saying that even if devolution took place , the national department of transport should continue to budget for this function as if they were running it themselves .
( iv ) the professional team are at present finalising the design and the quantity surveyors will then be in a position to more accurately assess the proposed cost of the convention centre .
mr speaker , firstly , i would like to ask the hon minister of education how many educators have been trained in life skills and , secondly , are all the educators that have been trained in life skills still in the system ?
i have to inform the house that in terms of rule 12 ( 1 ) of the standing rules today , tuesday , 6 february 2001 at 11 : 45 has been determined as the date and time for the opening of the provincial parliament .
however , no one - and i repeat , no one - no matter which party they support , need ever feel that this government is anything other than a helping hand in their journey through life .
in the past year , the violence in the transport industry has been brought under control , and i thank the hon minister of transport , sport and recreation for the key role he played in resolving this problem .
mr speaker , there is not much more i can say , other than to repeat my thanks for the way this matter has been dealt with and i accordingly move the second reading .
mr speaker , the adjustments estimate , the second of the current financial year but the first of the calendar year 2001 , is tabled today to seek the approval of this parliament of certain further adjustments to the 2000-01 budget .
the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling , having considered the subject of the western cape second adjustments appropriation bill [ b13-2000 ] , referred to it , begs to report as follows :
for the information of the hon leader of the opposition , i confirmed a few issues that the president and i had discussed at that meeting when i wrote to him on 24 january this year .
( 1 ) the process of formulating a policy framework for property management of provincial assets has already been commenced with and a cabinet memorandum to give further inputs to the process presently serves before cabinet .
whether there are traffic training centres in the province ; if so , ( a ) where are they situated and ( b ) what results are achieved at these centres ; if not , whether such centres can be established at schools ?
because outstanding motor vehicle licences are the single biggest problem at this stage , this debt is considered highly suitable for a pilot project designed to test and evaluate the practicability of an alternative debtor system .
i want to add , however , just in response to the hon minister of finance and development planning on the subject of casinos , that i believe we need to spend time on what not to do .
i can state that the deterioration of financial administration in south africa can be largely ascribed to the lack of , or the manner of implementation of properly equipped financial training programmes for management at middle and lower levels .
my department was also instrumental in arranging , because of the similarities of the crime committed , for a visit by alison to valencia farmer 's mother who was so viciously raped and murdered last year .
the courses will be three months long ; the intakes will be 100 in strength and there will be 10 courses a year starting from the year 2001 , the first three being this year and will act as pilot projects .
they would do well to be consistent now , look at the hsrc opinion poll , and say that where the anc is in power , people feel safe ; and where the coalition is in power , the crime rate is the highest .
my point , with respect , is quite simply that this has nothing whatsoever to do with powers , but everything to do with insufficient political will , inadequate policy , the lack of a plan and successful implementation thereof .
the most important fact we must take with us is that comm van heerden was allowed to write this curriculum vitae of his in practice , under the leadership of the hon minister and in his time .
i do hope that this is something that the hon minister will look into - allowing cpfs to function perhaps within a broader framework when they are attached to a particular police station in a community .
madam chairperson , in the budget statement for the department of community safety the following subsections are listed under the title " overview " : " mission " , " core functions " , " strategic objectives " and " statement of key government outcomes " .
i should like to thank ms bokkie claasen , the 70-year old new np member of the city council , for having joined mr japie kok , chairperson of the control body , and the headmaster , mr clarence carolissen , in leading a march of the school community against vandalism .
every negative word said by those hon members , particularly when it is done in public as that hon member has done , even though it is sometimes true , has an impact on their ability to perform their tasks .
areas served in this manner were bishop lavis , khayelitsha , manenberg , ocean view , langa , guguletu , mfuleni , mitchells plain , grassy park , hout bay , parkwood and ottery - no bishopscourt , no rondebosch , no newlands , no wynberg .
my directorate is furthermore involved in school sport only to the extent that it makes transfer payments to ussasa and assists with tournaments on the logistical side , where possible , and attempts to resolve any disputes which may arise .
the department and the government should carry out a strategic investigation of the focus of sports development with reference to poverty relief and crime prevention , and the socio-economic conditions of the community of the western cape must necessarily be taken into account .
i have spoken at length of these achievements at every opportunity , at every level of our provincial community , and still there are people who say to me : " but why do you not inform the people about them ?
if we are to defeat negativity and lack of pride in our country and in this province , it is the fiduciary obligation of the media to play a constructive and supportive role in spreading the good news .
his analysis concluded that despite a real reduction in the education budget of 24 % over three years , the outputs from the education department , across all measurable variables , had risen considerably .
in partnership with rotary we are running programmes in 100 primary schools to enhance the abilities of teachers to teach language , and in partnership with read we are introducing a major literacy project in some 40 primary schools .
i have significant concerns about basic literacy levels in our schools and we need to pinpoint exactly what we should do to ensure a far higher level of literacy than we are currently achieving at primary school level .
we still face major challenges in manenberg and delft , and we must spread the programme with due urgency to khayelitsha , philippi east and the rural areas which are tragically becoming increasingly prone to this kind of threat as well .
the wced allocated r3 million to each of the first two phases of the project - in total r6 million - and the provincial it budget also contributed r3 million to the second phase of the project .
i have a whole file here on adult literacy ; on rural schools ; on pre-primary education ; and on all the other issues that i know i will be attacked on for not having addressed in my speech .
however , in our effort to maintain the status quo we must be very careful not to be really confronted , 15 years later , with the demands of transformation as they will be manifested in our schools .
in line with the commitment of the national government to promote a culture of learning , the national deputy minister of education visited the school to revive the morale of the teachers , learners and governing body in the area .
i am afraid that curriculum 2005 took a very good and simple concept and potentially turned it into something so complex that it is even difficult for some of the experts to understand .
clearly , if this happened at pinelands , we would do precisely the same thing , but i can tell hon members , so would the teachers , and so would the parents - long before the department would have to .
i can also report on successful discussions with various private hospital groups to the effect that all their hospitals are now available for the immediate resuscitation and stabilisation of patients , whether or not they are on medical aid .
we will also draft new regulations and by july or august 2000 we will be ready to launch the new regulations to allow us to issue private hospital licenses in this province again .
sending fourth-year and fifth-year students to spend a single night in trauma , where they are left to their own devices to learn what they can , should they desire to pitch up , is a mere excuse for training .
mr chairperson , we all agree that the eradication of poverty requires universal access to economic opportunities that will promote sustainable livelihood and basic social services , as well as facilitate access to opportunities and services for the disadvantaged .
- provincial government departments will be requested to include poverty eradication in their vision and mission statements , which will result in poverty eradication projects being part of the strategic objectives of each department as well as their budgets .
we should use it wisely and go out and market the child support grants , so that more children can come onto our books , so that more children are being targeted and to ensure that the very poor are receiving their r100 .
why can buildings like the one in elsies river - previously a school for girls - the woodstock hospital , the old vasco clinic and the khayelitsha orphanage not be used by the department in partnership with ngos ?
it sounds ridiculous , but taking the fact that over r1 billion goes to maintenance grants , i really believe that government should approach budgeting in a different way , not only in a maintenance way .
his reply was that juveniles , once they leave prison , are fed back to the welfare organisations , and that this department , when it comes to sexually molested children , believes that the family is the critical element and is where it all happens .
i believe that their job is not only to continue giving leadership to the area of social services , but also essentially to say to the doubting thomases that they are wrong .
at the moment , for example , a previous national minister of welfare , mr abie williams , is to appear in court on 43 counts of fraud , corruption and theft , and he has been put in that position by the office for serious economic offences .
i am pleased to announce that such a policy has since been adopted by the cmc and the mlcs , and has been accepted by the provincial housing development board as a provincial housing programme that can be implemented throughout the province .
although good progress has been made with many targets that i have set for my department and myself , there are always a few bottlenecks that delay and impede efforts to address the growing housing need .
i said that this would be the last time that i plead that ownership should not only be for single houses , but that it should also be extended to those people living in maisonettes and flats .
we could be earning close to r500 000 in rental from some of these estates , but the embarrassing thing that comes out in this report is that less than r11 000 per month is being received from some of these estates .
the result is that many households whose primary need is shelter cannot afford the recurrent costs of highly serviced sites , forcing the local authorities to suspend service provision due to non-payment and mounting debt .
madam chairperson , i want to mention at the same time that in the awarding of tenders , the local authorities will empower tenderers from the disadvantaged communities in such a manner , through training and other means , that the projects that they begin will be completed .
madam chairperson , i would like the hon minister to comment on whether he does think categorically that the election will take place in november this year , based upon the variety of rumours that continue to circulate about this particular matter .
an honest appraisal of the situation will find that some municipalities in this province started off in 1995 , when we started with the first phase of transformation , with an inadequate revenue base and an inadequate financial and administrative capacity .
cmip funds are not reflected in our budget and funds allocated to housing boards are not reflected in our budget , yet we are expected to deliver in these fields .
my decision is informed by certain technical irregularities that occurred during the final stages of the assessment and is not - i repeat , not - a reflection on the management of the entire application .
mr chairperson , i give my support to the government 's taking itself under review , if the hon minister and the department believe that it is due to technical irregularities and also , more importantly , in the interests of good governance .
it is clear that we are well on our way in shifting the paradigm in environmental affairs away from concentrating on conservation and nature reserves to human rights based governance in the interest of all people .
it is a representative body of the people in the western cape , which has been appointed through a democratic process , and hence the recommendations they make within our policy framework will reflect the will of the people of this province .
in the light of that , on behalf of the standing committee i wish to support the hon minister and the western cape language committee with its able members and encourage them to give effect to the stipulations and requirements of the western cape provincial language act .
in other words , where there was a greater concentration of libraries , nowhere does there appear to be an effort to rationalise libraries and distribute those library services to where they are also needed .
we must now build our rainbow nation into a society not defined on the basis of race , ethnicity , language , religion , culture or other such considerations , but we should lead the way towards a better life for all .
the first is the rain forests of south america , the second is the rape of the forests in madagascar and third is the western cape fynbos , which accommodates 8 600 species , 5 800 of which are encountered nowhere else in the world .
it is a representative body of the people in the western cape , which has been appointed through a democratic process , and hence the recommendations that they make within our policy framework will reflect the will of the people of this province .
the department of transport is participating with the national department of public works in a programme of clean and green projects aimed at improving living conditions in underserviced communities .
tender documents , as prepared for the department , specify that a certain percentage of the contracts be awarded to " previous disadvantaged individuals ( pdis ) " - a formula has been drawn up for this - and " affirmative business enterprises " .
i believe that when an amount is allocated to roads , inter alia levies collected from roads , for example licences , such monies should only be used for the upgrading or repair of existing roads or for new roads .
it will happen that next year in this budget debate hon members will get up again and point out that they asked us in this debate not to carry on with restructuring without consulting them .
the hon member mr mckenzie is aware that when advertisements are placed , and if there has been a mistake in the advertisement and it is found that other criteria are necessary to complete the tender , it is rectified .
firstly , the impact of the increased use of it-related tools in industry - often referred to as a revolution similar to the advent of steam and electricity - and , secondly , the globalisation of production and competition .
madam chairperson , i would like to remind the house that projections indicate that over the first decade , if left unchecked , we will lose 20 % of our workforce to aids in this country .
where are we in this province in relation to electronic commerce - the hon minister mentioned it - and gaining sector information to do mapping exercises , and where are we delegating these functions ?
they must at all times consider it their duty to design a provincial system within which manufacturers in the industrial sector are encouraged to focus on the manufacture of local products and to export such products .
the hon minister said a lot , of course , about the promotion of smmes , and there is still a lot of work to be done in this area , especially in relation to the empowerment of black people and women in this province .
the answer is simply that the international convention centre is a company and the normal rules of conflict of a company , which apply to every single member of the board of directors , also apply in this case .
i would like to advise the hon member that the policy on informal trade in terms of the businesses act , 1991 ( act 71 of 1991 ) , and in terms of the constitution , is something which local authorities must do .
it is my sincere hope that at the end of this sitting every person in the house will have a deeper understanding of the crucial role of this industry in the lives of the people of south africa .
broadly , the amount has been allocated as follows among the directorates : administration , r10 million ; technology , development and transfer , r37,966 million ; agricultural engineering , r24,8 million ; and veterinary services , r11,8 million , totalling r84,7 million .
when one begins to analyse the key objectives , the main analytical question that we have to ask in respect of the budget is how this budget is going to narrow the existing gap and bring it to a more acceptable level .
i wish to say to the hon minister of agriculture , who has occupied this portfolio for the past nine months , that it is a pleasure to see with what warmth and fellow-feeling he manages and experiences this portfolio .
at one stage there was enough chardonnay and when the kwv wanted to buy it to make distilled liquor , the farmers did not want to accept the price because they thought they could get more for the wine .
i have spoken at length of these achievements at every opportunity , at every level of our provincial community , and still there are people who say to me : " but why do you not inform the people about them ?
if we are to defeat negativity and lack of pride in our country and in this province , it is the fiduciary obligation of the media to play a constructive and supportive role in spreading the good news .
the attitude of the provincial government has been that the anc was interfering with the portfolio , followed by the hon minister saying that his portfolio should be left alone - he would deal with it .
i want to say to the hon minister that on 11 may 2000 the community of khayelitsha held a march , trying to bring this problem to his attention and crying for his help .
as the anc committed itself to ensuring that apartheid would fall , in the same way we shall and we have committed ourselves to exposing the hypocrisy and racism of the new np / dp government to the people of the western cape .
the human rights culture that the hon member mr lewis talks about is fantastically important , but there are two and a half pages protecting the rights of the criminal and not one clause protects the right of the innocent .
] with respect , when the albertinia case occurred , where the farmer drove over the worker , whatever the merits or demerits the anc were there at once and their leader here immediately said that they were racist police .
that the house congratulates the members of the springbok rugby team who were selected last saturday , and wishes the team the best of luck and success , and expresses the hope that they will be successful and return with glory .
three members from the new np did not want to take evidence , decided that the proceedings were a little too long and raised a point of order , saying that they wanted to vote on the matter .
mr speaker , what is worse - and this is something my colleague referred to - is that the administration submitted a contract to the tender board for a process of registration , and the tender board rejected it .
if the new np is so confident about this local government election , why - and perhaps the hon minister of local government will answer this - are they ducking the issue of a single-party executive committee mayor ?
it has a great deal to do with the fact that the new np is in deep crisis and has to claw back votes in communities which have become disillusioned with politics and highly disillusioned with the dp .
owing to a lack of sufficient knowledge of the matter under discussion , and also owing to my lack of knowledge as to the procedure followed in handling this matter , i want to make two remarks .
no. if the new proposal is that the iec - or whoever else - should be called in here , let me remind hon members that it can only be done if they are called in at standing committee level .
madam chairperson , i would like to know whether you are asking each line function ministry to give details of the money they have contributed to a central fund at the provincial treasury for the treasury to spend the money .
could the hon premier indicate to us in vote 1 , out of which programme or subprogramme the r65 181,71 was allocated to voter registration and what in these programmes had to be sacrificed or could not be fulfilled ?
to fully answer the question , i also have no reason to believe that the money spent on the registration of voters did not arrive at that figure of 770 000 odd voters .
] i want to give the hon member the assurance , seeing that he spoke about spending the money on poverty relief , that we have given r3 million in savings to the poverty relief fund , as against r18 000 for registration .
i am glad that the hon minister of social services and poverty relief has given himself a little more room , because i responded to his statement that the savings came from money allocated to pensions .
madam chairperson , if this is a monthly savings process , i would like to know from the hon minister of social services and poverty relief how he prepares in anticipation of the registration of new people coming into the system ?
madam chairperson , is the hon minister of education aware that as a result of her refusing to make the white school and brown school an integrated school , our children in lamberts bay ...
in the opinion of the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation , and given the fact that he has devolved his discretion entirely and in part has just acted recklessly , whether he is convinced that that money was well spent .
as i told hon members already , we had a letter from the office of the president as well as the submission by the chairperson of the iec who also asked us to make the assistance available .
madam chairperson , all i am prepared to say at this point is that i would have preferred this to be voluntary , that the volunteers would have volunteered , as he earlier suggested .
madam chairperson , i would firstly like to ask the hon minister of education what she would do if voter registration affected education , because not only ordinary teachers , but principals and deputy principals were involved in the process .
] every time anybody is asked to do something voluntarily , they do it because they know that if they toyi-toyi enough afterwards , they will be paid under the table and that is all quietly ...
mr speaker , i believe that with an election prospect in the distance that the opportunity exists for us to say , as we said , the visions are mother 's milk ; we agree with that .
when we consider the result of the recent election , in this election the da attracted a total of 50 % of the votes in this province while the anc received 39 % of the votes .
in the coming year it is my aim to build on the good working relationship we have with the national minister of safety and security and particularly with the national minister for justice and constitutional development .
i am truly convinced that i have joined a committed and devoted team , a team of leaders who will be able to tackle the problems the hon premier mentioned in his opening address , head-on .
i make myself available to ensure that progress is made with these strategies but more , that the strategies become action plans and that all the available resources are utilised to the maximum extent in a well-considered way in specific priority areas .
we speak about racism in the house , and then we do such bad things as sacking people for simply raising the fact that black people are not acknowledged in the city and in the province .
it is , in fact , not a valid point of order because the hon member ms rossouw is entitled to make such statements , and hon members on the other side of the house do so repeatedly .
soon after the election in 1999 , these people claim , they found that the amount of work outsourced and subcontracted to them steadily declined , to the extent that they now get virtually nothing .
however , when this coalition , now styled the da , usurped power in 1999 , these very same people now sense that there is a new paradigm , a paradigm which has it that the market will determine everything .
but the saddest thing is that the anc government lost sight of the 1 500 hiv-positive cases being reported in south africa daily - the very same people for which the jobs are supposedly intended .
the total cost of putting in the cameras - and the chairperson of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling is absolutely correct in his correction of the report - did not involve cpos at all .
madam chairperson , i would like to ask whether the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism would like to correct his statement that the casino paid the additional money , which has now been contradicted by the hon minister of community safety .
mr speaker , i would like to follow the hon member mr louis in expressing the condolences of the anc to those who have lost their lives and their loved ones as a result of the taxi violence and conflict .
whatever bus company comes on board - it could be golden arrow or monix or chilwan 's - the small and medium enterprises must be accepted on a 50 : 50 basis and they must be regarded as equal .
mr speaker , a few weeks ago we had a special sitting with the intention of capacitating the hon minister of transport and works to deal with the violence in the taxi and bus industry .
formalisation was the intention in the vision speech of the hon minister of transport and works , for which he was rightly praised when he made that speech , although we did not know that it would not be followed through .
i will not rule the hon member out of order , but i must caution that hon members must take care in the future that the motions that they put to the house can be dealt with and are reasonable .
clause 2 , which deals with authorisation , gives comprehensive authority to the provincial government so that the convention centre will be in a position to perform better and the provincial government itself will be capable of performing any acts which a shareholder may perform .
to the bohemians of the 19th century it was a french gastronomic oasis in the midst of victorian london , and to the great foreign exiles of that age it was a heaven of good food and great beverages .
it is close to the heart of cape town 's business world , and it also lies at the centre of cape town 's leisure industry , linking the famous victoria and alfred waterfront hotels and entertainment facilities conveniently situated within walking distance .
i would like to refer the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism - who has an astute legal mind - to the " convenco agreement " , p 5 , the second agreement , if he has them on front of him .
the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism said that we should consider this a simple transfer of moneys to another institution , and used the example of the department of social services , which does that .
report of the auditor-general on a performance audit of government motor transport at the former department of transport of the western cape provincial administration [ pr94 / 1999 - page 3 , paragraph 4.2 ] : permanently allocated vehicles were not optimally utilised
mr speaker , on a point of order : is it parliamentary for the hon member mr isaacs to say that an hon member of this house told lies to the standing committee and tells lies to the house ?
as my colleague correctly said , the hon minister of local government took a political decision to exclude the system of executive mayors from the kinds of municipality that may be established in the province .
the anc have already succeeded in destroying local government in the eastern cape , gauteng and other parts of the country and , should we allow that in the western cape , they will destroy local government in the western cape as well .
mr speaker , we have heard contributions from hon members this morning , especially from hon members on the other side of the house , regarding the independence of the judiciary and the importance of making a positive contribution .
at 17 years of age , because i opposed republic day celebrations in may , five of my chums and i went to prison for the weekend because of the then minister of police , now turned liberal .
mr speaker , i would like to start by telling a story about a young woman - a young woman , like many young women in south africa today , employed , and aspiring to become a property owner .
furthermore , the small , medium and micro businesses must be freed from oppressive employment conditions such as industrial councils and collective bargaining agreements , because they do not always make it possible for the small , medium and micro businesses , owing to restrictive legislation .
this hegemony of policy eats away at the authority of provinces and stifles innovative alternative policies , purely because of the anc 's paranoia that a suggestion that does not come from them has to be anti-transformation or anti-anc .
they sold the idea to south africa that they were going to privatise state assets , put them in this fund and give the money to the disadvantaged people to give them the ability to obtain collateral .
mr speaker , on a point of order : could the leader of the house just explain the rather unprocedural actions of tabling and then , as i understand him , withdrawing the motion without notice that he tabled ?
that the house notes that the previous call for the suspension of the former minister in the office of the premier regarding allegations over the tonko bosman primary school was not heeded by the premier ...
madam speaker , there is a dangerous assumption - and it is a dangerous assumption on that side of the house - that just because people own their own homes , they are able to be exploited by a tax-greedy government .
i therefore think that in this draft legislation there is a flaw in that section , as authority is only given to the municipality to implement this and phase it in over a period of three years .
we want to tell the anc , which can also exert an influence on their national minister , at least to see to it that since the act must be passed , it is a workable act that must be accepted .
madam speaker , it was very encouraging to detect , after the most recent farm murders which took place in the citrusdal district about two weeks ago , a feeling of unity in parliament when all political parties expressed their unhappiness about it .
i do not want us to single out farm murders as a unique form of crime that happens somewhere and is different to the crime that we deal with on a daily basis within the broader community .
report of authorisation in terms of sections 25 ( 4 ) ( a ) and 25 ( 5 ) of the public finance management act ( pfma ) ( act 1 of 1999 ) , dated 26 july 2000 , as follows :
3.2 in addition , an admission by an informer during criminal proceedings to the effect that a reward will be payable only upon conviction of the accused person , is regularly invoked as an argument that the informer has a motive to furnish false evidence .
to consolidate the law in respect of the payment of taxes by the holders of bookmaker licences , and so to remove any potential uncertainty in respect of the issue of taxes payable by such licence holders .
mr speaker , i was wondering whether on this particular matter i had to make a disclosure that i may have had a conflict of interest in view of my having visited the 777 casino in the past .
i have instructed the western cape gambling and racing board to do everything in its power to address the serious effects that problem gambling could have on families and the society at large .
it is in no way necessary to license the race course as well as the premises on which it is situated because the suitability of the premises , taking into account the activities that take place there , is already covered by the totalisator operator licence .
this procedure will have the benefit of providing a complete defence to persons found in possession of gambling devices for the purpose of social gambling , since such persons would have obtained prior authorisation from the board .
this kind of incompetence and corruption by that council must come to an end. i plead with the hon minister of local government and development planning to intervene because as we speak the situation is still continuing .
the person who is in charge of appointments in that council and who is one of the few persons who had access to the van niekerk report washed his hands of the responsibility and said that everything was in order .
how can the hon premier allow this to happen when the civic association wrote to the hon minister of local government and development planning in june already , informing him about the illegal building operations in that area ?
what this debate is essentially all about is our responsibility to promote good governance , and in this new south africa good governance , for the information of the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism , is about accountability , transparency and clean government .
] this motion has been placed on the order paper because it is our contention that good governance has potentially been put in question through the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism 's participation on the board of convenco .
i have shared matters with them both on and off the record , more particularly on one of the portfolios i still hold and one portfolio that is now the responsibility of the hon minister of local government and development planning .
report of authorisation in terms of sections 25 ( 4 ) ( a ) and 25 ( 5 ) of the public finance management act ( pfma ) ( act 1 of 1999 ) , dated 30 august 2000 , as follows :
it also states : intelligensiedienste moet egter eerbaar en in nasionale belang na die waarheid betreffende die veiligheidsinligting soek , het ' n dure plig teenoor die land om hierdie vername deel van die intelligensiegroepings beskeie , meer vasberade uit te voer .
it was faxed to my office from someone calling himself / herself " anti-pagad muslim " , who indicates that he / she sent this letter to the newspapers , but that it has not been published as yet .
what is the experience in particular of those people whose experience in the past was not the best experience and who indeed embody to a great extent the injustice , struggle , pain , suffering , and so on ?
nevertheless , i think that it will give us in the province a boost if they are big enough to admit that they have failed and inform us how they seek to rectify the matter .
] it is because they have insisted on tearing down the support pillars of good governance , while simultaneously pumping up the demand for delivery , that they have dashed the very expectations their soaring rhetoric excites .
we shall definitely accept that with regard to the last part , namely that we " besorgdheid uitspreek dat die dp en die nuwe np meer besorg skyn te wees oor die situasie op plase in zimbabwe " .
the highest wages are paid in the metropole , and the poorest in the karoo - where the hon member mr gelderblom comes from - where it is something like r265 for men and r202 for women .
however , the state prosecutor decided to withdraw the charges of murder and abduction , but he referred the charge of assault to the director of public prosecutions as a result of the political flavour of this charge .
according to evidence , there are various cases in the western cape where municipalities have granted their town clerks and other employees additional remuneration and / or fringe benefits without the formal approval or exemption of the local division of the bargaining council .
evidence indicated that payments totalling r120 000 which had been made to six district councils had not been included in the amount authorised by the western cape finance act , 2000 ( act no. 1 of 2000 ) .
] the hon member mr ozinsky should not interrupt so often and deal more with the facts when he writes letters to the cape argus on planning and make sure that they are more accurate .
we , from the acdp , would like to take this opportunity of thanking the hon premier and all the hon ministers for establishing good principles and setting the tone for the year 2001 .
the hon leader of the opposition said in his reply to the opening address of the hon premier that it did not have balance in that it did not narrow the gap between the rich and the poor .
i renew my offer because , if they will not cooperate with me , they will end up in not - to explain this to them - representing the people that have voted for them .
mr speaker , it gives me great pleasure to enter this debate today , especially since south african politics and that of the western cape has seen an historical change over the past few months .
yesterday , when the hon minister of social services and poverty management was being sworn in , he made the most reprehensibly racist statement ever heard in this house when he said , " david , now at least you are bringing colour to that party !
the national minister of housing has now given the instruction that i gave a long time ago , namely that no transfer should be done in future unless a five-year pre-emptive right has been written into the title deed , which will prevent ...
i find it very interesting that the deputy leader of the da , marthinus van schalkwyk , finally found the guts to go to cradock and to go to kwazulu-natal to meet the family of chief albert luthuli .
we must see to it that environmental impact assessments get done and are processed with a view to a result , instead of developing a policy as to how best to do an eia .
we intend to set up , through a service level agreement and in conjunction with community safety , a special task team , catered for in the budget , specifically to take care of the lawful operation of public transport .
mr speaker , on a point of order : i am not sure whether i heard correctly , but i think the hon member mr fransman used a word that is not permissible in this house .
clearly , the response by organised agriculture as well as the da is not correct , as their only response is evicting farm workers , making more use of contract workers and mechanising the industry .
the voter registration process for the coming local government election must be supported by all parties in the house because it is in the interest of true democracy that we enable all citizens to cast their votes .
we need to say to them , " come and park your water-bomber planes free of charge in our country " , so that we can utilise their capacity when we have fires during the summer months and they have snow on their mountains during the winter months .
mr speaker , our concern is that the steps that the government is taking , as outlined in the hon premier 's speech , are severely interfering with the independence of the iec as specified in the constitution .
of course the anc will not support me , but if we measure ourselves against the other anc-controlled provinces they will have to agree with me in their heart of hearts that this province 's finances are in a good state .
in the content of the opening address of the hon premier it is very clear that the coalition government has no real plan to deal with the needs of the people or the poorest of the poor .
the man in the street and the business community of the province - and hon members will have read about it in this morning 's newspaper - the church leaders , school principals and sports bodies no longer ask what is happening with the coalition .
and , mr speaker , all the hon members of the coalition are guilty by association , because they do not stand up and speak out when they do not agree with how the hon premier feels about poverty .
madam speaker , our people are not interested in the number of delegates that the hon premier addressed in bavaria , austria and france , but are rather concerned about the high rate of crime , unemployment and homelessness .
in november last year an anc mp ms kamfer , while addressing a public meeting at kranshoek , just outside plettenberg bay , answered a question about declining health care in the area by saying , and i quote :
poised on the tip of the continent , the 122 000 km  offers diverse and exciting investment opportunities that include established and new growth sectors , as well as a number of major projects being implemented or in the planning stage .
but before i start on that , my first impression of the debates of the past few days has been one of sadness , because the one man on that side of the house who was really committed to antipoverty has been humiliated .
i therefore request the hon premier to take the lead in the establishment of a discussion forum of the church groups which share this ideal with us , with specific time scales and instructions to address social and economic problems .
in contrast the national leader of the new np focused on what was positive and also mentioned certain weaknesses , but did not respond in a way which was essentially not trying to find national consensus .
these whites also understand and accept that poverty affects the vast majority of coloured and african people , and they are prepared to work with the anc to address these issues on a daily basis .
mr speaker , the hon minister of transport and works said in the house today that the anc was racist because they called both coloureds and africans black - they did not know who they were .
those people are sitting in the bundu today because of the new np , who have shifted the blame from themselves , their own hands , their own government and their own creation , and said that the anc should take the baby .
we could have reduced the extent of the overexpenditure , but we would have caused the collapse of certain services by doing it , particularly the services provided by groote schuur hospital and other primary health care clinics .
we must not underestimate the potentially explosive nature of the crime situation , since it is but one of numerous factors in an equation of increasing frustration and dissatisfaction on the part of the people of the western cape .
we also need to fire any servant of the criminal justice system who fails to perform , from the police commissioner down , and we must establish municipal law enforcement agencies in every municipality where this is necessary and affordable , and increase visible policing .
madam speaker , criminals are also walking through an open door in the criminal justice system - a door left open when victims are too demoralised , confused or intimidated to report crimes committed against them .
on 18 november 1999 , the national minister for agriculture and land affairs told me that i should send all relevant information to the national minister for welfare and population development , which i did on 23 november 1999 .
if one wants to talk about incompetence , let me tell hon members how incompetently he handled the gambling portfolio when he was still in our party , and how the hon premier had to hand the portfolio over to me .
particularly important in this respect is the important role of the new budget format and the need to measure progress while continuing with the fiscal discipline which this government has sought to impose during the past year .
firstly , we must ensure the improvement of overall performance by ensuring that the formulated key measurable objectives translate into improved service , sensitive to the real needs of our clientele , particularly the poorer communities .
] sir , in the western cape it is 17 % and in the rest of the country it is 38 % . for that reason we are still better off , but that is not good enough for us in the western cape .
mr speaker , what is more , the hon minister in the office of the premier threw all her toys out of the cot and ran to the police station to press charges against the hon member mr ozinsky !
mr speaker , despite the lack of consultation on these issues , the budget calls for millions of rand to put in place transversal policies and programmes for all the ministries on the issues of gender , disability and youth .
mr speaker , in the year 2000 we can now look back and say that we had to drag some parties - most notably the new np - albeit kicking , into the system from the initial resistance from the mid-1990s .
thanks to the thorough budgeting control imposed by dr barnard and his team , the western cape has been able to escape the burden of corruption - and that is obvious , everyone talks about it - that is paralysing most of the other provinces .
the development and distribution of information and bulletin boards and brochures to the pawc offices in particular will be finalised as soon as possible so as to make the desks and their activities known to the staff of the pawc .
as a key measurable outcome by 31 march 2001 , we will endeavour to successfully develop a policy document and business plan to capacitate the already established poverty relief desk and implement the actions contained in the business plan .
what would this house have done if i stood up a few days ago and told them that i have a business plan for poverty alleviation when in fact i knew that there was nothing in existence ?
law is a dynamic discipline , and it is particularly pleasing to see the way in which legal services has adapted itself structurally to suit the changing legal needs of the administration , and the western cape provincial government .
i propose that she should have an action plan to guide her , failing which i propose that as she has established the youth desk , she should have a corps to assist the government with youth affairs .
the people will come here ; they will have no capacity and - like the rest of africa - they cannot rule ; they will be bad , oppressed and nasty ; and they will bring no quality of life .
we stated that gender does not suggest looking at women alone - let us just get that fact straight - but at the relationship between women and men and how our society is structured along gender lines .
the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling , having considered the subject of the western cape appropriation bill [ b 5-2000 ] , referred to it , begs to report as follows :
the committee notes with concern the problems referred to in sub-programme 7 , legal services , regarding staff for legal drafting and recommends that urgent attention be given to this matter to enable staff to be trained in legal drafting .
the committee would like to express its sincere thanks to dr j c stegmann and all his staff for the positive working relationship between the department and the committee , which assisted with the easing of the workload of the committee .
i can assure hon members that we will continue in our staff appointments to conduct the process in such a manner that our staff at all levels become more representative of the demographics of the province .
madam chairperson , we have reached the point where i feel that if we can implement this budget , it will go a long way toward enabling members to perform their duties optimally .
madam chairperson , for various reasons it is desirable for a parliamentary complex to have its own demarcated area , a special demarcated area that allows space and makes gardens and room for physical movement possible , as well as room for mental exercise .
we say that committees must be addressed as a matter of urgency in order that they may fulfil their constitutional duties and responsibilities , but , of course , we have objections if the capacitation of the provincial parliament is done by a different method .
the new budget will be addressing some of these needs , of which a major one will be the filling of some new posts that are in accordance with the douglas report - or , as the deputy speaker sometimes calls it , the " gibson " report .
also present at the meeting at the sanp offices in knysna were various interested and affected parties , who declared themselves to be supporters of the hon member mr winde in his constituency .
was the intention of the hon minister in going to visit the people in knysna to advance party / political needs , or was it his intention to bring the government closer to the people ?
it is once again clear from the tone of this interpellation , that it goes not so much to the answer of the hon minister of local government , but to the apportioning of r3 million for the entire registration campaign .
if the hon minister and the dp are so interested in elections , why this morning , when the archbishop called together the interreligious commission to talk about the elections , were the dp and the new np not represented there ?
whether any court cases involving his department are still pending for this and the previous financial year ; if so , ( a ) which court cases and ( b ) what is the financial breakdown of these cases ?
i have a detailed breakdown of how many computers were stolen per department and also a breakdown of the value per department , which i will table . to read the actual document would not make sense ; one requires to see it .
the hon premier as head of the cabinet has not complied with an act of parliament and the hon premier should be brought to book for non-compliance with the act .
it was at a time when i was specifically concerned with the tender board and its procedures , and i felt that i required further information and discussions with the hon premier relating to the matter .
at the meeting my department reconfirmed its point of view regarding the validity of the environmental management plan and that the homeowners ' association and the developer must reach an agreement on who is responsible for addressing the upgrade of the emp and its implementation .
the council had to zone land in an admiralty zone and if there was an appeal against it it would come before me , but it is not correct for me to speak in regard to the responsibilities of local government .
funding applications for projects not exceeding r25 000 were thus processed by cultural officers of the chief directorate : cultural affairs of the department , and recommendations were made to the relevant senior officials to whom the powers were delegated for approval .
as far as the number of people that benefited from these projects is concerned , there were 160 projects , so i am not going to go through all of them , but i shall give the hon member some examples of projects and the relevant attendance .
when i was first confronted with the problems i had certain concerns , and my first reaction was to terminate the contract and issue a summons for damages and so on .
( i ) it initiated and facilitated meetings in august 1998 with the council and the department of nature conservation to try to determine which conditions had not been complied with and the responsibility for the implementation of the rezoning conditions ;
mr speaker , the hon member knows as well as i do that the new planning development act provides that once the regulations and so on have been finalised , within three years there have to be structure plans for the whole province .
on 8 february 2000 the chairperson of the council reported on the matter to the executive committee of the west coast district council , after which the agreement on 1 march 2000 by the applicants and the council 's lawyers was concluded .
my trip to china and our agreements with other countries in the world are simple examples showing that the western cape is prepared , with good governance and democracy in this province , to be a guiding light to africa .
the number for the period in question is 447 , of which 253 were authorised ; 24 were not authorised ; 86 are awaiting review by the department and 84 are awaiting completion of the assessment process by the applicant .
the answer i received from the hon minister was that the auditors deloitte and touche and the department of transport were dealing with the matter and that the province therefore had nothing to do it .
taking the large presence of black businesses in certain industries , the barriers that exist for any new entrants in other industries and the affordability of a preferential procurement system into consideration , the policy at the time was limited to certain industries .
at present part of the agreement between the directorate : sport and various organisations is to bring people from disadvantage areas to the events , or to take some of the participants to the disadvantaged for development clinics .
i have also been advised that along with the cape metropolitan tourism and cape town tourism , the western cape tourism board was approached by the organisers to speak at the conference and to have their logo displayed on the programme .
whether the municipality of darling re-employed the former town clerk ; if so , ( a ) to what position was he appointed and ( b ) whether the position existed prior to the appointment of the former town clerk to that position ?
does the hon premier feel that this incident , being another attack on private enterprise which is linked to foreign investments , will have any significant financial impact on the province 's financial investment viability as a whole ?
i ask the hon member mr ramatlakane to do me a favour and give me the details he requires in writing and i promise to come back to him in a few days ' time .
i announce that vacancies had occurred in the representation in the house due to the resignation of ms f j adams with effect from 25 october 2000 , and mr p j marais with effect from 5 december 2000 .
our approach is to work in cooperation with the national government , all the law enforcement agencies , the private sector , non-governmental organisations and the broader community to take back our streets and make safe the homes of the people of our province .
our new international partner , the state of california , sets a fine example of how coordinated and determined marketing can generate income and local jobs , and we would do well to take their example to heart .
sir , the hon minister of housing had to provide 114 000 houses ; he has provided 120 000 houses , many more than he need have done , and he could provide many more if his budget had not been cut .
it is our contention that the same procedure whereby the premier is elected should be followed for deciding whether he should resign or not - according to section 6 ( a ) of schedule 3 of the national constitution .
in terms of section 39 ( 3 ) of the land use planning ordinance , 1985 ( ordinance 15 of 1985 ) the council is responsible to ensure that the rezoning conditions are complied with .
my first follow-up question is to ask the hon premier if he thinks it is acceptable that taxpayers and citizens in this province should wait nine years for conditions that are placed on planning approvals to be implemented .
i know that it is a national competency , but i think it is a critical question because at present 1 000 permits at the department of home affairs need to be finalised by the national minister of home affairs .
madam chairperson , in preparation for the implementation of the public finance management act , the treasury component of the department was substantially restructured with the assistance of the organisation and work study component and of the then department of corporate services .
tender board approval has consequently been obtained to outsource the recovery of outstanding motor vehicle licences and / or the rectification of records on the master file , on an experimental basis for a period not exceeding eight months .
as a result , we are only able to spend on highly critical areas , which means that it expenditure will have to be increased substantially over the next few years if we want to participate meaningfully in the digital economy which has already resulted in major change worldwide .
a serious and costly failure to comply with tender provisions has arisen , and the hon minister of finance and development planning is glossing over it when he simply refers to delays and costs in the manner that he has .
the hon minister then also told us that there is no new procurement policy because he is waiting for the regulations to accompany the new national act on procurement before he fine-tunes his policy .
i wish to compliment the hon minister of finance and development planning on an excellent budget presentation , as well as extending our support , praise and thanks to his entire department who have so ably provided the house with detailed assistance during the budget process .
the customs and tax-free trading facilities that could be offered would give cape town a similar status to hong kong , and offshore banking facilities could be provided in this free trade zone to attract foreign capital and investment .
it is innovative and experimental policies such as i have outlined that should be allowed to uplift the poor - not condemn them to more poverty , more hunger , more homelessness or more crime .
there is no money generated out of casinos if one takes into account the social problems , and i must say that i appreciated the hon minister 's focusing on that element today .
let us face the fact - and let the hon minister also face it - that the anc has given direction and , in fact , is giving direction from the opposition benches , and will continue to do so .
how many hon members on that side of the house have the courage of their convictions to stand up and say what is wrong in the other place or what they feel the anc there does wrong ?
that the house expresses its thanks to the officials from marine and coastal management , as well as the relevant saps and navy units for their timely evaluation of a potential crayfish disaster in elands bay and the necessary precautionary measures that were taken .
if one looks at the hon minister 's speech today and compares it to the budget statement we received , one finds that this hon minister has stayed within the confines of what is being asked of him .
the accused displays insufficient political will in so far as transformation and change of the saps in the western cape are concerned ; and the accused is failing to provide any moral and political leadership whatsoever to the saps in the western cape .
indeed , this shows that there is obviously a more holistic or larger problem with crime than just homing in on the western cape situation , as my colleagues on that side of the house are often wont to do .
the hon minister and his management team are sending out a signal to the community at large that they care about all the people of the western cape when it comes to the protection and securing of their lives and their possessions .
being the committed hon minister that he claims to be - or rather , that is how the media portrays him in the western cape - he is clearly demonstrating no commitment to the legitimate claim and aspiration of disillusioned policemen .
i will be neglecting my duty as a member of the standing committee on governmental affairs and community safety if i do not say a word of special congratulations to the hon minister and his department with the implementation of this project .
madam chairperson , i know that you will wholeheartedly support me on this issue , because the passion that you display when you debate matters concerning our children is characteristic of a committed teacher who genuinely cares .
the second objective is to increase participation in sport and recreation at all ages , from school children to senior citizens , to encourage healthy lifestyles , sportsmanship and team spirit and to offer an alternative to crime , drugs and gangsterism .
yes , we shall endeavour to bring big name stars here , but i must let the hon member know that many of our name stars , except those who have a very strong charitable spirit , demand quite a lot of money upfront .
this is much in line with what president mbeki referred to on friday when he celebrated the success of a group of soweto high school students who obtained their matriculation exemptions despite their previous involvement in crime and other deviant behaviour .
madam chairperson , stripped of all the lofty phrases in vision and mission statements , the western cape education department 's main goal is to make quality education the norm in all the education institutions for which we are responsible .
mr chairperson , in the wced we speak about school development as a continuum from a to z. our six priorities only take us from a to f ; they aim to get the necessary basics in place .
mr chairperson , our implementation plan for tirisano that i have just outlined guided our budget , and it will also play a role in guiding a major development in the months ahead .
mr chairperson , i am not suggesting that many of our schools are not suffering under profound resource constraints - they are - and the circumstances of many of them would be significantly enhanced if they had more .
it is no longer unusual for parents that a child tells them about a free period in the morning , and it is specifically those periods of the so-called non-examination subjects which are no longer receiving attention in the schools .
i believe that that sometimes is a fallacy , and i think that we need to do a marketing exercise whereby we can attract many more students to public schools than private schools , because that is where the majority of people are .
now a school must either increase its school fees to such an extent that the average parent is simply no longer able to afford it , or else it has to scale down the management body posts which are increasingly evident in the schools , with clear consequences for the pupils .
in this financial year we also intend to enter into discussions with health care funders to enable us to capitalise on public sector advantages in terms of the new medical schemes act , 1998 ( act 131 of 1998 ) .
for the 2000-01 financial year we have allocated an additional r500 000 to improve the coordination and management of tb , with the aim of improving the cure rate from 68 % to 80 % over the next three years .
however , on a regular basis on saturday nights , neither tygerberg hospital 's nor groote schuur hospital 's emergency department is available , because they have to close down for up to four hours as they cannot cope with the load of serious trauma .
if one reads this budget , one finds that he is employing only 58 of them , and the policy document , which reviews this , contains a graph showing that 1 000 nurses are needed in this province .
i would say we should not assault that any further because we took undue overtime away from them , but rather look at those unscrupulous medical practitioners who claim overtime and then do not work it .
regarding medical waste , if the hon leader of the opposition were in the house more regularly , as he should be , he would know that the hon minister of local government is dealing with medical waste .
] i expect that in future a far greater fuss will be made about where the desk should really be placed , who should really run it and all the old meaningless nonsense that is associated with such arguments .
by creating an opportunity for all south africans to become empowered themselves , we in the dp recognise that south africa has made substantial progress over the past five years towards a freer more vibrant economy .
i am not saying that there is funding going astray , but whereas health and education have gone into fiscal and financial control in a big way regarding large amounts of money , this department seems not to have reached that stage yet .
secondly , i would like to say that for a long time the acdp has been concerned about the plight of the children , and that is why the whole issue of the commissioner for children has become a very critical one .
she also said that by the end of the year - that was 1999 - all departments would have focal units and then , madam chairperson , she went on to say that a gender audit was being done .
will she be able to say she is developing an intersectoral , interministerial , multidisciplinary policy development programme to address their poverty needs and perhaps she will perform an audit to find out what these needs are ?
we cannot say that it is the responsibility of one minister or one specific department and you put a challenge to the department to address the issue of poverty in the western cape .
on account of increasing pressure on the available financial resources , i have given instructions for industrial and business premises and other non-residential premises belonging to the provincial housing development board to be identified with a view to having them placed on the market urgently .
that is why the anc supported the former minister 's announcement on 20 january 1999 that the municipal ordinance would be amended to allow those who are still indebted to local authorities to become owners .
the anc also moved an amendment to the bill which will ensure that the town treasurers , who sometimes are a law unto themselves , have no discretion not to grant the clearance certificate if the conditions are met .
in du noon we find houses of 20 m  to 22 m  - and that is called a housing development , and the hon minister is proud to say that he is building houses for the people of the western cape !
it is commendable that the hon minister and his department have made provision for a second subsidy for these beneficiaries , should they be deprived of the right to occupy the land in respect of which a subsidy has been paid out .
we were hoping that the housing fund and the financial manager introduced in terms of the new housing act , act 107 of 1997 , would be in place by 1 april , as announced by the hon minister of housing on 8 september 1999 .
no one can deny - and certainly not we on this side of the house - that in some cases the conduct and poor decision-making of councillors have contributed to the problems that beset local authorities at this point .
therefore , i cannot agree , and i want to vehemently disagree , with the hon minister that one can ascribe certain of the problems that municipalities experience to affirmative appointments , as he seemed to imply .
] mr c m dugmore : madam chairperson , i think we very often forget that the local government transformation process has come a long way and we are in almost the final stage of what has been a very , very difficult process .
if we face facts when it comes to the delivery of services at local government level , the reality is that the new np and the anc represent over 80 % of the voters of this province .
in keeping with the key cabinet objective of reprioritising our goals towards greater environmental sensitivity , i am pleased to be able to report that considerable progress has been made with the province 's bioregional planning studies .
the intention of this consultative exercise is to ensure that development planning throughout the province is aligned in such a way that the goals and objectives which are pursued in both provincial and local spheres are coordinated and compatible .
it is a source of encouragement to me , and evidence that the western cape province has good leaders , that we have a cabinet that moves close to the interests of all the parties and the population of the western cape .
we hope that the process that is followed will not be one that belongs in a lunatic asylum , but one that deals with the proper planning imperatives of this province and of the metropolitan area .
we need to get the message out to the population of the western cape that where there is a vested interest , we will look at that interest in a sustainable manner where there is a balance between development and the environment .
mr chairperson , the hard reality is that the success or failure of the future of this province depends largely on the way in which this province looks after the total overall development planning of the province .
let me assure him that local authorities that i have contact with on a regular basis have the greatest appreciation for this assistance and that they will in future rely on the ongoing support and leadership provided by him and his department .
we have had countless people come and tell us , " we want to stay on in this administration , but it is almost unbearable to work in certain departments dominated by an afrikaner white male mind-set .
let me say , it is not my intention to start poisoning or shooting officials - positions can only become available , certainly in the senior rankings , when people retire or move on or otherwise .
as minister of environmental and cultural affairs , i have a legal duty to comply with the constitution and , with my budget of r59,203 million , i believe that my department and i will fully acquit ourselves of this task .
in our youth camps we shall not only equip our young people with the life skills that will make them leaders in their communities , but we are also targeting the fight against hiv / aids as a deliverable outcome .
sir , i hope that the department of environmental and cultural affairs will engage in a vigorous attempt to educate the people in the western cape that the environment is very important for us as the inhabitants of this province .
when the hon minister says that he will use the money for creating awareness about cleaning up the environment , i hope he is not going to follow the example of the cape metropolitan council across the road .
we also want to point out to hon members , as the hon member mr williams has said , that there are some very strange things in the regulations , including regulations on how one can sell biltong .
to afford this process more impetus , structural changes have become inevitable and this means that with the statutory powers at my disposal i am presenting a more streamlined programme of service delivery to the people of the western cape .
the feasibility study currently in progress will identify the form of governing body and technical executive body required to administer the authority , based on the functions to be performed by this authority .
madam chairperson , if everything goes according to plan , and the hon leader of the opposition does not put a spoke in the wheel again , as he did two to three years ago , the road will be completed soon .
i have a list of all those people , and i will read the names of only a few of them : abe contracting , abrahams builders , davids contractors , carim builders , abantu civils cc , afron cc , t solomons electric and apollo maintenance .
- and forget about the workers who work at ground level , like the men in the orange overalls , the drivers of the pa trucks , the tractor drivers , the people who work on the road graders and the people who work with shovels .
i am sure hon members have noticed that the global consortium iridium which provides satellite telephone links , put 200 satellites worth billions of dollars into low-earth orbit , have been declared bankrupt and have been liquidated .
i have instructed the department to come up with proposals to streamline the western cape land administration act and the regulations issued in terms of that act to better facilitate the disposal of properties owned by the province .
to date we have only received 26 section 28 ( 1 ) certificates , which means that this province in total is in control of only 26 properties - in effect , that is , as the legal owners endorsed on the title deeds .
the future challenge is to build upon the success that has been achieved in order to create a world-class tourism sector in the western cape and a centre of excellence not only for south africa but the whole of africa .
with small and medium-sized enterprises so dominant in the western cape , one would expect the bulk of new investments and expansions to be locally or nationally funded rather than from foreign sources .
they bring into our ambit as government a smart partnership between civil society and government and business which i believe is unmatched by many of the other institutions in a broad framework .
if the national minister had been prepared to accept a long time ago that his bill was unconstitutional , we would have progressed a lot further down the road of creating a system in this province which could in fact start bringing people into the net .
in this country and more specifically in this province it is a challenge to find a marriage between staying ahead on the global treadmill and in the forefront of millennium developments , while at the same time persisting in government objectives such as job creation .
if there is a drought or a drop in price as has now appeared in the table grape industry , where the farmer has to pay in although he has high input costs , how can it be expected of those people to pay minimum wages ?
the stock theft unit has earned itself the name of , " pocket of excellence " , but in the same way as the saps throughout south africa they have a manpower shortage which prevents them from really making an impact on cattle theft .
" that the central government immediately make adequate policing resources available so that the people in this province can be safeguarded against the intimidation surrounding the confusion in the taxi industry , which is as a result of national policy .
this is much in line with what president mbeki referred to on friday when he celebrated the success of a group of soweto high school students who obtained their matriculation exemptions despite their previous involvement in crime and other deviant behaviour .
when all is said and done , mr speaker , the problems that we have been experiencing do not in any way give anyone the right to use intimidation , or to allow violence and terror to reign in the province .
mr speaker , the third issue is upholding the rule of law , which includes adherence to a legal contract that exists with golden arrow bus services and , fourthly , and most importantly , there is the safety of the community .
never before in the history of the western cape has it been necessary to give the minister such powers as may be deemed draconic - as it has been expressed by the other side of the house .
today we have a constitution and a bill of rights to protect our children , but the wave of violence against children is pervading the cape flats , the working class areas where the poorest of the poor live .
mr speaker , i would firstly like to congratulate the hon member mr byneveldt on moving this motion - he did not give up , but was persistent in wanting to move the motion .
mr speaker , one of the biggest evils we have encountered , and one of the biggest evils that we must consider and go into , is that of losing the values and respect for one another .
the police remove the stock of a shebeen , and when the accused appears in court the next day , the magistrate decides that he cannot seize that liquor and the police have to take it back .
what i do want to say is that every time a person like amelia jansen and bianca gosh dies while we are playing games in this house , it is as good as if we pulled the trigger ourselves .
i shall leave the matter at that , and i caution all hon members not to allow us to play games with the rules of the house in regard to serious matters , for the sake , perhaps , of political gain or for any other reason .
the government - and i am not saying the anc - did not give the iec the full amount of money they should have received , and which they had requested in order to do their job properly .
may i say that if the hon members on that side receive the answers from the various ministers in writing and they believe that the house has authorised something which they think is unauthorised ...
what instruction was the hon minister given in terms of the amounts required from his particular vote , noting that he has to spend r3 795 from his and finance only released r707 ?
if the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs were to receive information in the details that showed that it was not a correct application of the funds , how would he then reverse the decision that has been taken here ?
] if the detailed information that i find out in any way differs from the information that i had in the telephone conversation this morning before i came to the house , i will put the full details before the house .
the opening of our parliament has to act as a reminder to all of us who have been entrusted with the responsibility of being public representatives that we are here because the most vulnerable in society have put their lives into our hands .
this , as we all know , is going to cause an outcry in the community and will affect more than 70 000 people in the western cape , not to mention the multiplying effect that such cutting of grants will cause .
i had my problems with former minister wiley , but to kick him out before he had served his term as member of the provincial parliament was unfair , particularly when integrity is claimed .
mr speaker , when we discuss the violence in our province and in our country , then this should leave no place for destructive criticism , snide remarks and in some instances even insulting remarks .
the da copied our commitment to free basic services days after the president made the announcement in beaufort west , but as i speak there is not a single da-run council that has implemented this promise .
the key difference is that the starting point of the anc is based on the fact that we must accept that the western cape is massively divided between the wealthy and the poor , as the hon leader of the opposition has said .
i was encouraged by the comment made by the hon leader of the opposition , that there are three years until the next election and that we all need to join forces for delivery to the people .
today i want to utter a warning to everyone who acts in this way on the pretext of trying to help people : time and again they destroy more job opportunities , human relations and the future of many people who are dependent on those job opportunities .
is the hon premier proposing that the western cape should ignore the proposals from the foremost scientific academic authority in the world on mtct issues and place the lives of thousands of pregnant women , as well as their unborn babies , at risk ?
the anc believes that the fight against aids cannot and will not be won without the personal involvement of all south africans - whether as individuals , ngos , communities , welfare organisations , private business , health organisations or government - in partnership against aids .
mr speaker , to kick off at this late hour , i once again want to thank all the members of standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling for their contributions and their endeavours to ensure that we had a clear understanding of the this adjustments appropriation .
i do not know how the hon minister of community safety is going to characterise this : are there other examples of a relationship between a single company and his ministry with respect to sponsoring something like the installation of cameras ?
madam chairperson , the hon member must understand first of all that this is not my particular vote and , therefore , my impression is that a total of r13 million was spent and that it came from sunwest .
madam chairperson , could the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs indicate , in the light of the fact that there has been no public process up to now , what kind of public process there will be in relation to this environment commissioner ?
mr speaker , on a point of order : is it correct that an hon member can take such a line in his speech , that he can turn around and blame other people for the violence that is taking place in the western cape ?
in conclusion , to both the hon minister of transport and works and the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation let me say that we appreciate the line of thought of quiet diplomacy that they have followed in the last week .
i want to say lastly , mr speaker , that we need to agree here and now that one of the key issues , the 50 : 50 percentage in public transport provision , should be expressed in writing in the contract system that is being processed right now .
mr speaker , that is but one aspect of the shareholders ' agreement which we have identified as something that could cause problems and in respect of which we are not satisfied with the answers given to us .
why do we want to accommodate a subsection 5 ( 2 ) for further contributions or to purchase additional equity , if in the agreement itself we have confined ourselves to purchasing shares to the value of a maximum of r60 million ?
i would go along with a new subsection ( 2 ) , but i would say that the current subsection ( 2 ) should become ( 3 ) and the wording of this subsection should remain as is .
ayes - 14 : brown l ; byneveldt s e ; dugmore c m ; essop t ; fransman m l ; mckenzie p c ; ozinsky m ; phenduka n c ; phike l ; ramatlakane l ; rasool e ; stali z c ; vantura m g and williams r .
we also think that this is unnecessary interference in the advisory capacity of the unicity commission and the district transformation forums that the hon minister must advise on , inter alia , the types of municipalities that are to be established in the various geographical areas .
in a system in which the executive mayor is solely responsible for appointing his cabinet , the interests of the society are exposed , inter alia , to the temptation of corruption , power abuse , overlooking and ignoring minority interests and nepotism .
the dp rejects the idea of an executive mayor and believes that the current multiparty executive system is the best system for the management of our municipalities as it allows fair representation from all stakeholders at local government level .
when the hon member mr r williams stood up and i saw all the weighty tomes that he had brought along , i thought that he was going to refer to the court case and the law and about where i had acted unconstitutionally .
prof jeffrey sachs , director of the harvard university centre for international development , who spearheaded this report , described how political stability had been a key factor in how business people perceived nations ' competitiveness .
the hon member mr r williams and our other speakers have made it very clear that the anc is saying that we have a right to criticise , but we do not interfere in the judgments of the courts .
one needs to understand the context that ordinary people looked at that situation and saw someone walking away , effectively a free man , and they compared that with the sentence handed down to dr allan boesak .
essentially , what the speakers from the anc and other speakers from the new np and the dp have done is they have identified some of the difficulties experienced and put a particular perspective on them .
( e ) the department had made no effort to communicate with the tender board on its decision to proceed with the purchasing of the equipment , which could be interpreted as disregard for the board ; and
by being protected by the group areas act , they carried out no responsibility for social expenditure , and today we find that pinelands is the area that is making the most noise in the newspapers about the new rating system .
however , while most citizens understand and accept their obligations to the state , they become alienated and obstructive when called upon to pay for a system that has the potential to be inefficient , unfair and short on delivery .
however , i was very happy to hear the hon member mr marais , who is now third in charge of the new np , state very clearly that this was not a speech of the da , but a dp speech .
madam speaker , i implemented it there and i was part of that , but the problem that we have with this piece of legislation at this stage is that there will only be a process of consultation with the community .
these land patterns have not been the result of a " big bang " , but have been the result of decades and centuries in which the indigenous peoples of the western cape lost their land through robbery , brutal force and violence .
i am trying hard but failing , regrettably , to recall a single occasion on which i have read a report or heard a remark on his part about convictions and sentences following such assaults or deaths .
the committee wishes to express its sincere thanks to dr j c stegmann and all his staff for the positive working relationship and in particular the role they played in the tranformation of the budget process to outcome based budgeting .
( 1 ) appeals to all churches and towns in the province to ring their bells on 9 september 2000 , international foetal alcohol syndrome day , for one minute at 09 : 09 , in order to create awareness of foetal alcohol syndrome ;
i have in the past indicated in the house that the western cape gambling and racing law , 1996 is a dynamic and living document , which needs constant attention and also needs to be updated and amended on a regular basis .
it is my personal opinion - and i am sure that it is shared by the western cape gambling and racing board - that there are three extremely important objectives to be served by the regulation of gambling .
certain issues were brought to the attention of the commission for investigation , for example building work proceeding without permission , as well as other allegations such as the possibility of collusion between the applicant 's architect and certain officials of the municipality .
sir , the building inspector , who must check on people 's properties as to how and when they build , builds his own home in marina da gama without first having his plans approved by the local authority .
what the hon member did not do was to quote , as i will do shortly , from the draft executive ethics code , drafted by the national minister of education , to implement that act .
] this was a profoundly callous premeditated murder , but when the killers were sentenced to life imprisonment , their families turned it into a race incident , blaming the judge and the dead man 's ageing father , in fact , anyone but the actual perpetrators .
mr speaker , to ease racial tensions in south africa and achieve peace and reconciliation , we need to stop dividing the nation in our minds and start multiplying opportunities for all in the real world .
it goes even further and becomes more pernicious , because it seeks to superimpose over the existing inequalities the notion , which to any sane and reasonable human being sounds fine , of south africa as a meritocracy - everyone out of the same starting blocks .
that is where we mix , but at the lower end , in the uitsigs and the guguletus , we doom the working class , largely black and coloured , to a life and an education system which give them no future .
on the other hand , i think we should allow the hon minister and the core of the debate to proceed and not allow ourselves to be distracted from the issue we are dealing with .
however , the committee believes that the constitution and the local government transition act , 1993 , in particular sections 10 , 10f and 10g ( 2 ) ( m ) , do provide an adequate mandate for the provincial administration in this regard .
persons in service of the state : clause 3 ( 2 ) this clause should be deleted because it could contradict other legislation and binds the mec into a process , which may be contrary to accepted labour relations practices in south africa .
report of the standing committee on health , social services , office of the premier and corporate services on the chiropractors , homeopaths and allied health service professions amendment bill [ b66-2000 ] ( ncop ) , dated 9 october 2000 , as follows :
in evidence the department admitted that the non-compliance with procurement prescriptions was mainly due to the lack of awareness , notwithstanding regular circulation of the procedures to be followed by officials of the administration in this regard .
the committee , taking cognisance of the steps envisaged to curb and avoid excess expenditure on the vote and recommends that the unauthorised expenditure of r3 862 995,10 be referred to the provincial parliament for authorisation .
the committee wishes to express its dissatisfaction at the lack of training in and disregard for tender board directives , but takes cognisance of the steps taken by the department towards improving the situation in this regard .
mr speaker , on a point of order : in the absence of yesterday 's attendance list , i should like to ask you as speaker whether the hon member mr mckenzie was present during the debate in the house yesterday .
we heard from reverend sampson that at a particular time - and i forget the date ; i apologise , i do not have my facts again - only 50 % of the total population registered .
as hon members might know , 95 % of all investment in the western cape is from the eu , with the united kingdom - topping it with r950 million just for last year - and germany being the greatest investors .
the hon premier has insightfully dealt with his vision and i look forward to working with him in our new unified political force to provide real delivery to the people of this province .
he agreed to that , so why did he have the audacity to imply in this house yesterday that we planned the opening of our parliament on 6 february 2001 because we wanted to steal the show from president mbeki ?
for the coming year we wish to focus on making culture and arts more accessible to everyone , and to look at innovative ways in which we can get audiences who are disadvantaged by their circumstances to venues .
mr speaker , i accept that we come from different constituencies within our own party and within the opposition , but the fact of the matter is that we in this house represent all the people of the western cape .
incidentally , when we were there on that day we found out that there was not only one fatality in the area , but that at least four or five people were killed that we did not even know about .
i want to ask the hon premier to accept that as a challenge , and then perhaps we can try to challenge the gangs there and put the security cameras where they are needed in this city .
he will know very much about failing support , because he belonged to an np whose support in this house from 1994 to the last election declined from over 50 % to under 50 % .
the largest portion of the funds allocated to transport for the 2000-01 financial year through the adjustments estimate will contribute to a number of projects , namely the worcester-robertson road , the agter-paarl road , the vredenburg-saldanha link and the klipheuwel-malmesbury road , which are carrying increasing volumes of commercial traffic .
the poverty , squalor and deprivation is such an embarrassment to the hon premier and his coalition partners that , on the advice of his spin doctor , no reference was made anywhere in his opening address to the existence of the townships .
in this regard we will be giving clear guidelines on an interim idp in the coming week , so that we can get it ready , at least for the first budget that has to be in place with effect from 1 july 2001 .
if they say today that the anc is going to achieve a major breakthrough again in the western cape , and in the cape town area in particular , i want to assure them that this is the single factor with which they have shot themselves in the foot .
( 1 ) noting the commitment made by the premier last year to provide the house with details on the amount spent by the provincial government to place advertisements in the journal , professional management review ;
( 1 ) that the committee established by the premier to advise him on allegations of corruption in the south peninsula municipality , has not met since the resignation of the former minister of community safety ; and
i have not seen this letter , but i understand that the mother was quite indignant about the fact that her child , a white jewish boy , has been referred to what is called a predominantly muslim school and a black one at that .
mr speaker , i applaud the hon premier for his statement that this government is more than ever committed to driving a process of transformation towards creating a people-centred and people-driven public sector .
if we continue to play petty politics , the consequential instability that will strike at the investment climate and play into the hands of those who want to destabilise our provinces will be a reality that we do not want .
] the provincial government should be giving money - and we agree that this money should be given - to the iec so that we can ensure that it will be used in an impartial and fair manner .
in terms of the changes which come into effect on 1 april 2000 , the conservation function will reside in the independent western cape nature conservation board , leaving my ministry with greater capacity to deal with brown issues and impact assessment .
mr speaker , is the new np aware - and the hon leader of the opposition was correct - that just down the road a black person could not buy an article in a shop .
madam speaker , we in the dp know that the private sector has an enormous contribution to make in eradicating crime and that many businesses and individuals have resources and skills that the police desperately need .
it is clear that the province wants to sustain the true democracy of our people at all times , and wants to ensure at the same time that , where success has not yet been achieved , those values are addressed urgently and speedily .
in a letter to the sunday times a certain r taljaard rails against the likes of kallie knoetze and pik botha for joining the anc , arguing that a strong anc is dangerous for democracy .
the world community - including the anc and some hon members on that side of the house - fought against the forces which brought about the holocaust and we all remember it .
then there is the situation where the person accused of abuse appears in court , and he or she says , " the reason why i have committed child abuse is the fact that i was abused as a child .
mr speaker , the anc that claims to champion the cause of the poor actually violated its constitutional obligation to provide these children with a basic education for almost three years .
i would also like to thank him for mentioning , at some length , the chrysalis programme , which is aimed at trying to train young adults for a better life and , therefore , to divert them from crime .
it has enjoyed the support of the national secretariat of safety and security to the extent that they have asked whether they can come and evaluate it with a view to replicating it in other provinces .
the hon member mr ozinsky has got a little ahead of himself , because my next line included thanking the members of scof for their undivided support when the department presented the plan early last week .
it is clear that during the time of ms martha olckers and now under the present hon minister in the office of the premier , who is simply another ms martha olckers , there is simply no programme .
mr speaker , what was conspicuous by its omission in the opening address of the hon premier is the fact that there was almost no reference to poverty , especially the levels of poverty that afflict the rural poor in the province .
i and those who know , respect and understand the circumstances of the farm people of the western cape - and i think that the hon member ms witbooi will also do so , as will others who know the conditions - will respond promptly .
account was also taken of the fact that the economic outlook for south africa over the medium term is positive which , in addition to the sector 's own revenue potential , could auger well for possible equitable share increases which would be limited to this sector .
the principles which inform our latest three-year medium term expenditure framework ( mtef ) , along with the budget which i am presenting today , illustrate the extent to which this government has geared its priorities and consequent financial resources to both national and provincial policies .
the decline , which is reflected countrywide , is due in part to a national policy decision to provide free care to individuals making use of the services of clinics and free care to children and pregnant women at state hospitals .
and finally , sir , to you , hon members of the house and the occupants of the public gallery , i express the hope that i have not during the past year been a generic substitute for the common sleeping pill .
after all , it is true that the leadership of the western province is serious about and cares about all its people and does not waste their time by joining in when there is toyi-toyiing before the parliamentary building in wale street .
i have continuously found myself in the position where i can see that there are enormous needs in the province and , as the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism said , we are still not filling those needs .
i , like the hon minister of finance and development planning , have great difficulty in accepting the findings of sa statistics that the western cape is the only province which has a shrinking population compared with all the other provinces .
the main focus of legal services this year will be the improvement of the overall level of legal services , particularly by fulfilling the province 's legislative obligations as imposed by the constitution of the western cape , and the rationalisation of provincial legislation .
madam chairperson , the only conclusion that i can reach is that there are still perceptions out there that the disabled cannot think for themselves , cannot represent themselves and cannot be productive employees .
in addition , staff in the eastern cape 's department of corporate services who had left the service continued to receive salaries 20 months after their names had been removed from the payroll , resulting in over r1 million in overpayments .
this should include the tender board , the department of trade and industry , the idc , wesgro , khula enterprises , lanoc , the land bank and the commercial banks , to mention but a few primary institutions that readily come to mind .
on 6 may 1996 there is a letter from the then mec for education to mcebisi skwatsha in which she stated that the hon member ms brown had agreed to serve as an unpaid member on the forum .
let me give the assurance that the hon premier and i will be bringing this matter to the attention of the house constantly and that we shall keep hon members abreast of the progress we make in this regard .
this is not the first time that the communists in that party have decided , " that is our propaganda , that is the way we are going to go , and that is the way we are going to do it .
the douglas report made a recommendation , but we have the director-general of the administration and officials of the department of public works all flexing their muscles on this issue of where we should park and where we belong .
these problems i have mentioned seem , i am pleased to say , to be in the process of being addressed by this new budget , as we heard the speaker mention earlier today .
in typical westminster democracies this is balanced by the fact that it constitutes a motion of no confidence in the government if the government of the day cannot pass its financial legislation and it then has to resign .
the hon minister goes there , hears nothing from their side and then he writes to the national government on an official western cape government letterhead , requesting that the national government review their decision that this development should go ahead .
in terms of the taxpayers ' money , i feel my visit to this project was worthwhile and i feel i also did my duty in terms of my portfolio as minister of environmental and cultural affairs .
mr speaker , we are not against the registration of voters who are poor , but we say that if the provincial government have that money , they should give it to the iec to do the registration .
mr speaker , when the hon premier issued a statement , he did so as premier of this province , the one who has to look after the interests of the people so that they can at least get their id books and register .
( a ) these reports were submitted to the premier of the western cape on 28 may 1998 and 26 october 1999 respectively as required in terms of section 12 ( 1 ) of the western cape provincial tender board law , act 8 of 1994 .
mr speaker , on a point of order : this is the second time in the course of this interpellation that the hon premier has used the word " girl " or " girlie " when referring to the hon member ms essop .
if not , the relevant cultural officer is requested to obtain the necessary information as the application cannot be formally submitted to the western cape cultural commission without all the information .
( 2 ) and ( 3 ) the r300 between the n1 and n2 is a proclaimed road which falls under the jurisdiction of the national department of transport and its agent , the sa national roads agency ( sanral ) .
the second aspect which causes me some concern is that the department of community safety , as far as this matter is concerned , did carry out an investigation in order to ensure that the department follows the correct procedures in regard to my duties .
mr speaker , if there is an omission with regard to photographs of members of parliament there , i will raise it with the superintendent in charge of the unit and see that the matter be rectified immediately .
( 1 ) who prepared the provincial submission to the small , medium and micro enterprises summit held at the national council of provinces on monday , 8 may 2000 , and whose views did it represent ;
when it comes to the public defender , he will receive any assistance he needs from me , as i have assisted the heath commission and as i have signed those documents that the hon member asked me about the other day .
] i will give assistance where i can - not only if i am asked to , but if i find that these things are not in order - to make sure that corruption is addressed in the province .
whether any schools under the jurisdiction of the wced were closed since 1994 ; if so , ( a ) which schools were closed , ( b ) when were such schools closed and ( c ) why were such schools closed ?
that is specifically why i have now written a letter to the town clerk in which i request him to tell us what they want , so that we can consider that together with all the other requests .
our institutions are gearing up to attract private patients back into our hospitals to increase revenues and projects of this sort are already running at clanwilliam , vredendal and tygerberg hospitals .
a list of properties that have been endorsed in the name of the provincial government of the western cape , is available and will be on the web page of the department of economic development , agriculture and tourism for information .
mr speaker , could the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism indicate to the house what benefits would have accrued to the v & a waterfront hotel in using it as a venue for presentation around the environmental impact study contract .
in terms of the urban transport act , the cmc acts as the core city and is responsible for transport planning within the cape metropolitan boundaries and not the western cape department of transport .
whether the town clerk of porterville has been found guilty of illegal trade in diamonds ; if so , ( a ) whether any disciplinary steps have been taken against him and ( b ) whether he will make a statement on the matter ?
how many times must i still say to the anc , " instead of being so destructive , come and work with us , if you are really saying you are in the service of your people in this province .
i look forward to a strong , cooperative relationship with him in his new capacity as mayor , as we work together to ensure that the future of cape town and the western cape is brighter and better than the past .
two years ago exports from the western cape to the rest of africa totalled r1,375 billion - a year later we upped that by another r150 million , and this figure is still growing .
as regards vote 7 - social services , it is a pity that we are going to come up against it again somewhere down the road , and that the reduction in the child grant and the suspension of certain allowances are going to develop into a political debate .
after the 1999 election the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs made this provision a priority in his programme which he put before the house to ensure that the constitution , which was adopted , was put into practice .
thank heavens it has at last actually happened in the year 2000 or 2001 , but we are now informed that the cabinet has not accepted the proposals and they have been referred to the planning department .
we have been advised , mr speaker , that the amount has to be excluded from voted funds , implying that no funds will be allocated , which requires us to make this technical reversal in our adjustments estimate .
as an aside to this , i may mention that we have done a lot of preparatory work on the existing regulatory system which tends to change from department to department and there has been a lot of interaction amongst the departments .
that the house , in view of the limited powers and resources to generate revenue in the western cape and in order to enable the western cape government to fulfil the enormous plight of the people -
madam chairperson , it is important that this provincial government should proceed with all speed to implement further procurement policies and strategies to enhance the participation of small and black-owned companies in the provincial procurement process .
the provincial service commission compiled a policy document on affirmative action and one of the guidelines of this policy was that the pawc had to appoint a special programme official to assist management with the establishment of a representative corps of workers .
i received some statistics from the department yesterday and despite the resolution taken by this house and cabinet - i do not know who has been consulted - the goalposts have been shifted .
if we look at that and begin to interrogate it , and when we consider the total population of 4,2 million in the western cape , then the figures tell us that 751 800 are unemployed in the western cape .
madam chairperson , it is quite clear that one of the criteria that was given a lot of weight in deciding who should get the casino was precisely the question of local procurement and advantage for previously disadvantaged communities .
secondly , given some of the remedial measures we have already taken , and together with my confidence in the calibre of the police in the western cape , i am convinced that we can and will succeed .
madam chairperson , in reviewing the project i have decided to institute some changes to the training programme to produce better officers and which will also help to relieve the manpower crisis in the police .
madam chairperson , the sunday times this last weekend reported that the national department of correctional services was so " riddled with favouritism , cronyism and corruption " that every appointment , promotion and merit award in the past three years will have to be reviewed .
what the house does not always remember , is that the anc stands here and they say many things ; not for the benefit of the house , not even for the benefit of the hansard record , but for the benefit of the television cameras .
i would rather urge hon members on the other side of the house , if they have even an ounce of objectivity in their bones , which i doubt , to test me and my department on what we do have authority over .
mr chairperson , as chairperson of the standing committee on education , environmental and cultural affairs i want to congratulate the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation and the staff of the directorate : sport and recreation on their activities in the province .
the communities of grassy park , guguletu , mfuleni , matroosfontein , manenberg , ocean view , hout bay , langa , nyanga , khayelitsha , driftsands , philippi and bishop lavis , amongst others , had projects where children and families came to take part in sport activities that were presented .
the budget allocated to sport may also create the impression that we underestimate the value of sport and the role that sport can play in our fight against social and community problems , crime and the issue of social transformation .
i want to reiterate that if we do not address the area of sport development urgently , we will not be able to produce the champions of the future and ensure a better future for all our people .
i wish to appeal to hon members on the other side of the house to join hands with us , to be constructive and to work with us as a team in the best interest of all our people .
mr speaker , time does not allow me to address in detail all the important issues , such as poverty relief and new legislation , but i am sure that my ministers will address these issues under their portfolios .
this is a very ambitious target , and i would like to thank all my senior colleagues , particularly mr o ' connell , who are playing a key role in this process and were doing so long before i arrived on the scene .
by way of example , i have spoken about the need to make hard choices in a climate of scarce resources between competing priorities , and about our assumption that we will achieve more through encouraging public / private partnerships .
i have spoken to principals and educators who say they are powerless to change these practices and have pleaded with me to reinstate corporal punishment to assist them in establishing punctuality in their schools .
in their place two special youth care and development centres will be established , accommodating pupils who , owing to the seriousness of their behavioural problems , must be removed from the community for education , development and rehabilitation .
we know that there are no quick-fix systems for education in this province or for the country , but if we adhere to the following principles , we will ensure that all learners achieve functional , numeric and information literacy at internationally benchmarked , age-appropriate levels .
in 5 to 10 years those provinces which are today faced with poor matriculation pass rates , but are engaged in the transformation of education , may begin to pluck the fruits of the pain that they are experiencing now .
we look forward to the breakfast in this building on 22 march , at which the hon minister will be the keynote speaker with prof kahn of uct , maths and science adviser to the national minister of education .
when we read articles like the one of 13 january 2000 under the heading , " school vandals wreak holiday havoc " , describing that 1 400 glass panes had been smashed and filth and textbooks were strewn about , everyone must be concerned .
it may seem like a clich to state that we have not all experienced our past in the same way , but nowhere is this fact more applicable than to our education system as a whole , and more specifically , to schooling .
as a basic step towards wiser spending we have decided in the 2000-01 financial year to clear the slate of most of the debt of local authorities which has accumulated over the past few years .
other concerns include the exclusion of the largest aids consortium , which represents 230 ngos , the fact that no researchers or scientists were nominated to the council and the lack of representation of health professionals or doctors in the nac .
one casualty department in the metropole which currently gives very good training in trauma management to interns , who work with their senior colleagues in casualty , is at conradie hospital , but apparently this casualty department is slated for closure this year .
it is very gratifying for us in the province that the department , which is one of the major spenders in terms of our budget , is now moving into a period of greater financial stability and can focus more sharply on improving service delivery .
at this stage , however , preliminary calculations suggest that the improved budget will also allow for the filling of approximately 500 posts in health , and this is a welcome change from the cycle of retrenchments over the past few years .
madam chairperson , i would like to join my colleagues in thanking the staff for taking us from nowhere to somewhere , so that we can participate in this debate today having been informed about action for the future .
r12 million in the academic hospitals budget is earmarked for equipment , which is good , but too little . r16,2 million is inflation on non-personnel expenditure , which brings us to a total of r110,2 million , which has to be spent in that way .
secondly , i want to thank our staff who are here today - dr sutcliffe , ms petersen , ms follentine , mr de grass , and there mr van der westhuizen is sitting to one side and i also see some of our staff in the gallery . i also want to thank the members of scof .
mr chairperson , for many years in this province catholic welfare development has run a project where one can have a whole garden in a " door " , enabling anybody to have a vegetable garden and fresh vegetables .
mr chairperson , i too congratulate the former minister of social services , as well as the acting minister of social services and poverty relief for the budget before us today , and for the very essential service that they deliver .
the point we are making is that if we look at those 25 000 people in relation to the number of aged people in our province , we can see that that r76 million is being spent on a fraction of the total .
a draft manual or explanatory memorandum in respect of the prevention of illegal eviction from and unlawful occupation of land act , 1998 ( act 19 of 1998 ) , has been drafted and is currently being circulated to metropolitan local authorities for comment .
another initiative that is in the pipeline is a programme to address the needs of aids victims within existing housing policies - and i think the hon member dr van zyl will be very happy to hear this .
the hon minister mentioned that he had asked local authorities in 1998 to come up with a plan to spend r100 million on housing projects and to date he has not received one plan .
talking of the provincial housing development board , i would also like to convey my congratulations to mr willie coetzee , the chairperson of the provincial housing development board , on his receipt of the chairperson 's award of the institute for housing for his sustained dedication to the housing process .
] where i come from - guguletu , nyanga , langa , crossroads , philippi - we would not conclude a housing debate without the involvement of women , because they are the ones who bear the brunt of the housing conditions that we have to put up with .
the balance of the grant , viz r1,3 million , was allocated to small rural municipalities to provide and upgrade facilities such as computers , fax machines , photocopiers and safes , which are necessary for the operation of that specific municipality .
madam chairperson , as we move towards the implementation of the new structures , we on this side of the house are now fully committed to ensuring an efficient local government delivery and service as possible within the new unicity .
with the new skills development act kicking in there is now some r14 million that will be available for training within the metropole , and this is indeed an ideal time for labour to improve their own position .
this much should become clear , and i am sure it has become clear , from the management audits that the hon minister commissioned , as well as those that were conducted in terms of the national government 's monitoring exercise , very aptly named project viability .
if local government is once again going to be reorganised into another tier , are we not spending a great deal of money retraining people only to see municipalities overseas taking these skilled people out of the system ?
firstly , it recommends that the hon minister appoint an industrial and management psychologist to deal with the huge change in local government - to deal with the people regarding skills training and how the management take-overs are going to take place .
regardless of what party the criticism might come from , i believe that i did the right thing , and i am certain that 99,9 % of the members of this house would agree with that and walk that road with me .
firstly , to revise current and formulate new provincial spatial coastal zone development policies in accordance with bioregional planning principles ; and , secondly , to formulate guidelines regarding the sustainable development of coastal farms located between existing and planned development nodes .
in the current financial year an amount of r3,2 million has been paid over to local authorities to assist them in developing the necessary capacity for integrated development planning , and a further amount of r1,1 million will be made available shortly .
madam chairperson , this is no doubt the appropriate time to thank the hon minister of finance and development planning since this is his last vote that we are discussing today and it is therefore the last occasion on which i can do so .
one of the reasons for all these processes being delayed is that the department , under the hon minister 's guidance , is not thorough in the way in which it takes these processes forward and the way in which it plans them .
this poses the question as to whether the criteria for spending these allocations will change once the hon minister of local government enacts the new demarcations , as all of these areas mentioned fall under the knysna municipality .
" this then results in the illegal building of second dwellings or structures , and it is then up to the local authority to either flatten the illegal structure or grudgingly give permission and pass the application after the fact .
however , i do want to put on record that i do , in fact , have a great deal of sympathy for the difficulties in the process of transformation and the impact that it has on the lives of those people who are going to be affected by it at a very personal level .
madam chairperson , the hon minister of finance and development planning asked me twice this week if i would be here today , so i made sure i would speak twice because he asked me twice .
i am sure that civil society and local government in this province are not going to allow a party that represents 13 % of the voters to concentrate 90 % of institutional power in its hands in this province .
whilst solid waste management , refuse removal and pollution control are local government functions , both national and provincial government have a crucial role to play in formulating the policy and setting the framework whereby these matters are managed .
this mostly neglected cultural activity , from an official point of view , always draws capacity crowds every year to its performances , far exceeding those of soccer matches and popular music concerts , and yet is has been neglected by the government , and sometimes actively discouraged .
at the same time there is the attitude - i think this is more difficult and takes more political will - that usually when one library is closed , the library in the town is opened and the library in the location is closed .
] the hon leader of the opposition must go and apologise to them and say to them , " we misled you by telling you not to pay and today you are saddled with this debt .
in the execution of this contract the use of local labour was particularly successful because 162 labourers per month were employed for 18 months and this contributed approximately r250 000 per month to the economy of the local community .
i would like to believe that we have moved away from a fragmented department of works where all the departments claim to have a right to construct and / or to create an asset independently of the department of public works .
we are in the process - and i can tell hon members this now - of determining , with the aid of the national minister of transport , whether we can reintroduce the fuel levy we had in the past .
i would like the hon member ms essop to give me a copy of the advertisement so that i can study it , give it to my people and give her an answer in return .
knowledge management implies the processes of identifying and getting access to new relevant knowledge , to disperse this knowledge within the company and to relevant subcontractors , and to integrate the new knowledge into products and processes .
the role of government as a competent dialogue partner to industry and the rest of society to meet the challenges of the knowledge economy , calls not only for competence , but also for speed in decision-making .
the industry is a huge employer - and i am not talking about bulk , i think gauteng are much bigger than us and i am only talking about the number of operators - and contributes billions to our gross regional product .
our policy approach to the support of smmes is to distinguish between support for smaller survivalist enterprises and start-ups on the one hand , and support for small and medium businesses that are already established and need support of a different kind .
i would agree with the hon member that we can look at a total framework of policy , but quite frankly , we are so inundated with policies this year already that it is not something which we will undertake this year .
i do not want to bore hon members with the woes of agriculture but , nevertheless , i think it is important to take note of the fact that farming is not a bottomless pit that can be exploited for social purposes .
wool prices have decreased by 12,7 % , and milk prices by 50 % in real terms since 1982 ; and meat prices are generally falling , with pork prices down by 8,5 % in one year and mutton down by 3,4 % in the same time .
madam chairperson , it is a welcome experience to listen to a minister who speaks for agriculture and not against it - and that is a minister who is supposed to look after the interests of agriculture .
( 1 ) expresses its concern at the unnecessary delays on the part of the premier in signing proclamations which would enable the heath commission to investigate a number of outstanding cases in the province ; and
i wish to appeal to hon members on the other side of the house to join hands with us , to be constructive and to work with us as a team in the best interest of all our people .
mr speaker , time does not allow me to address in detail all the important issues , such as poverty relief and new legislation , but i am sure that my ministers will address these issues under their portfolios .
if the circumstances in an area are deteriorating towards an unacceptable level and unless there is an immediate improvement , it is my intention to declare the area as a declared area , as contemplated in section 30a of the proposed amendment act .
to tell the truth , this would have created an impossible situation for any minister in this regard and not merely for me because it would have been necessary to get people to look after the vehicles .
i ask that hon members , especially on the other side of the house because i know we have the support of hon members on this side of the house , play a more positive role here .
it is surely not wrong if we sometimes refer lightheartedly to one another and permit that in the spirit of the debate , but the hon member mr ozinsky officially referred to the hon member in that way .
if line functions have given up money to a central fund , the heads of those departments and the ministers must inevitably be held accountable for what those moneys were spent on , how they were spent and whether they were spent in the way it was intended .
madam chairperson , given that this is a contemporary vote , did the hon minister of education - in allocating the amount of r1,6 million - apply her mind to the possibility that in addition to the allocation of funds , teachers would be involved ?
the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling , having considered the subject of the western cape finance bill [ b 1-2000 ] , referred to it , begs to report the bill without amendment .
mr speaker , my major criticism of the hon premier 's opening address yesterday is that it presented us with no sense that he understood that our major challenge in this province is precisely to find that balance .
no one denies , least of all i , that drugs do not have an important role , but in the absence of a mention of lifestyle change , of behaviour modification and education about sex we give a one-dimensional approach to a complex problem .
let us make sure that whether as government in opposition we are able to grasp the opportunity to ensure that the gap between rich and poor , which is the fountainhead of our pathologies , that we work at that .
mr speaker , as far as resources are concerned we acknowledge that we are responsible for quite a large portion of the provincial budget , but i can assure the house that we need a great deal more to make our goals materialise .
mr speaker , before proceeding i should like to point out to the hon premier in his absence that his appointment of the hon member mr bester as the hon minister of community safety has not even had its first birthday .
sir , i also wish to ask that this action should not be the exclusive responsibility of a state institution but that agencies such as nicro , western cape anti-crime forum , neighbourhood watches , police forums , mothers against crime and other similar organisations be involved .
our communities are fed up with this culture - the culture of not caring for human lives or for people 's possessions ; a culture in which children have no rights ; and a culture in which the elderly are cruelly assaulted and murdered .
all he did was he mentioned that the record of the department of housing is well-known and that the province has approved projects far in excess of funding made available by the national government .
if so , he should then stop the da council and support the call of the anc , namely that the proceeds of these sales should be returned to mr moolman and the council should negotiate with the four families .
i have , in fact , told him this in so many words , which has predictably enraged the honourable representative for crossroads , prompting him to issue a thinly veiled threat to me to stay out of the area .
so there he was on full pay from the department of education , stress-free and happily running around playing politics , while we were wasting the cost of a full teaching post and children were doubled up in the class .
the fact that the hillstar traffic wardens cannot raise the problem that their promotion has not been put in place , and they are terrified to speak to their boss , must tell us that it is a painful endemic racism .
[ mr p m jacobs : mr speaker , the hon premier , who is not present at the moment , stated in his opening address that the drug nevirapine would be used to prevent mother-to-child infection in the province .
hon members can see , therefore , that by closing the cattle theft unit the national government was sending a message to agricultural communities that cattle theft was not their problem and that they did not care about the welfare of the rural areas .
mr speaker , even though president mbeki has decided to exercise his right to silence about the scientific aspects of hiv / aids , his contentious statement that hiv is not necessarily the only cause of aids is still taking its toll .
although the national department of health was tasked with representing south africa at the who and un aids talks on the extended access initiative , the national government has not yet indicated if it wishes to become part of the process .
we know that the former minister of social services and the minister in the office of the premier both had poverty relief functions and these roll-overs may stem from the considerable confusion that characterised that period of our unfortunate history .
1. the immediate audit of all taxi licences so that permits can be issued only to permanent operating licence conversions ; 2. operating licences to be issued only for a period of five years , unless there are unconditional licences for an indefinite period .
however , the parents told us there would be no point in doing that because they still feared that their children would be attacked , no matter what alternative transport to the taxis was chosen .
i think it is critically important , given the indignation expressed by the hon member mr dugmore on the other side with regard to certain innuendoes , that one should look at the facts of the situation .
the formalisation of the associations and their operators is absolutely imperative , so that we can deal with an organisation that is not like shifting sand , sliding around , but one that has a definite leadership and does not change its negotiators all the time .
suffice it to say that we must address safety and security on an ongoing basis and continue to emphasise the high-value product that we supply at budget prices with our current exchange rate .
for example , one will have a two-day conference on computing technology in cape town , but at the same time for two or three hours in the morning or the afternoon a computer marketing expert from japan will be able to dial in , participate in the conference and ask on-line questions .
let me hasten to add at this point , unless this is used as a red herring later on , that we acknowledge the prerogative of the cabinet to enter into agreements such as this .
it seemed to us as though hon members of the new np in particular were so keen to please the hon minister , apparently in order to keep the coalition going , that they would agree to anything .
the critical role in delivering broader economic benefits to the community is the motivation behind public funding for the development of convention and exhibition centres , quite often through joint contributions by the local state governments , as we are doing here .
it might be very irritating for the hon minister to answer these questions today , but we were not afforded the opportunity in the committee meeting to ask the questions , so we are using our opportunity now .
the reason why there is this consequential insertion in the existing subsection ( 2 ) is so that the province may then only hold equity in convenco if it fulfils the objects as defined , and if affirmative action principles are applied .
the unauthorised expenditure amounting to r29 985 arising from the purchase of radios by issuing separate order forms to circumvent tender board requirements and for which ex post facto authority could not be obtained , was considered .
the standing committee on economic development , having considered the subject of the cape town international convention centre company bill [ b9-2000 ] , referred to it , begs to report the bill with amendments [ b9a-2000 ] .
mr speaker , on a point of order : will the hon member mr isaacs tell the house in what respect , in detail , i tell lies in the standing committee and in response to whatever he says .
when the hon member mr mckenzie referred to men looking at pensions , i did not think it would be worthwhile to look at that , because i have only been here a few days .
the fact that the hon minister is not doing so , quite simply tells us that he and his party have no confidence that they will cut any ice in any of the local governments in the elections .
in determining the types of executive systems from which the hon minister of local government may choose category a , b and c municipalities , the western cape is taking a firm stand against any centralisation of political control in the key position of mayor .
the anc knows that should it take control of local authorities , it wants all the power and will thereby kill any notion of cooperative governance by excluding other parties at the expense of their own cronies .
it is ironic that it is specifically chief justice mahomed and judge president chaskalson of the constitutional court who expressed their strongest opposition to the errors of the anc in regard to their criticism of the judges and the judiciary as such .
let me say that we in the anc did not become excited about the drama , and i say this in the face of the hon minister of education 's best efforts to show that we were excited .
the new np and mr van schalkwyk must choose whether the new np is going to define itself essentially as a party involved in white oppositional politics or whether it is going to be a party which drives a coloured transformation programme .
since our announcement of this campaign , the anc has received a flood of responses from black businesses that have come to complain to us about the fact that they cannot survive because they do not have access to capital .
the smmes also tell us that they receive calls from the dp at their offices and businesses on a daily basis , saying , " join the dp economic desk in order to enjoy business benefits .
sir , the next point is that if one deals with an investment no bank , no financial institution and no government will or should give money to a small enterprise simply because it has a particular identity .
yes , we will service them and we will not - and the question was asked earlier in the week and i replied to it - under any circumstances use any government position , or abuse a position , to advantage anybody .
i am very pleased that the debate was called this afternoon , because it is time that issues regarding property , and in particular the issue of property rates in the western cape eighth gambling and racing amendment bill , were discussed .
what he must understand is that in the largely white communities , such as at my homes in george or in mowbray , people have been provided with services over the years every two weeks , and garden and refuse and so on is removed .
that the provincial cabinet take note of the strategic outcomes of national government and that there is a clear synchronisation and link between the nine strategic outcomes of the provincial cabinet and the six of national government .
mr speaker , on a point of order : i should like to address you about a remark that the hon member mr mckenzie has just made , in that he said aloud , " his own speaker now has to call him to order .
mr speaker , while the western cape eighth gambling and racing amendment bill , a money bill , dealt with provisions pertaining to financial matters , the western cape ninth gambling and racing amendment bill intends to address identifiable shortcomings in the existing legislation .
while all of us in the province recognise the value of gambling in assisting the provincial fiscus , we must be extremely mindful of ensuring that gambling is controlled and that unscrupulous elements do not take advantage of the law .
before the motion could be debated , the hon premier wrote to the anc and suggested that we send a representative to a task team to advise him on whether a commission of inquiry should be appointed or not .
] we agreed to participate as an indication of our good faith , and we agreed to hold back the motion at that point to enable the task team to do its work .
in the almost two months since then no steps have been taken to replace him in the task team and no word has come from the hon premier to inform the task team of his intentions in this regard .
] what makes matters worse and more disappointing , especially for the hon premier , is that this situation exists in his own backyard , in his own constituency and in his own town , retreat , which he says he likes so much .
i think that this government has shown from past experience that it does not shy away from its constitutional duty to appoint a commission of inquiry when the need for it arises and , most importantly , in appropriate circumstances .
mr speaker , the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism stated that the cape town city council did not object to his being a member of convenco on the grounds of a perceived or direct conflict of interest .
if , by some far stretch of imagination , somebody said that i had not severed the umbilical cord of my business interests , as i have done , would the hon premier regard this matter as being trivial or not relevant ?
unless we turn that around , and the ordinary citizen has a feeling that if injustice is done to him , the perpetrators will be brought to book , we are creating a breeding ground for vigilantism and actions of that type .
our united voice , provincially and nationally , combined with additional police resources allocated by the national government , will bring us closer to restoring law and order in our province , and ensuring the safety of our people .
mr speaker , racism is an international phenomenon that , if allowed to go on unchecked , could replace the capitalist / communist cold war of the past as the biggest single threat to the survival of mankind .
in this regard i want to urge the anc in future to structure their lists and use their ample talent to find black ministers for the future to come and sit in the house .
in short , the primary victims of racism and apartheid cannot be the main sources of the solution and , on the other hand , the primary beneficiaries cannot be let off scot-free from their responsibility to make our society more equal .
just remember when america , one of the biggest democracies , had already placed racism on their books as an offence , but in the 21st century they still had the klu-klux clan burning people in the streets .
at the same time , in the interest of expediency , i am taking this opportunity to present to the house other budget adjustments to date which , in the absence of section 25 ( 1 ) authorisations , would normally only have been tabled in february 2001 .
- a further allocation to this vote was made on 30 august 2000 in the amount of r37 million to settle centralised sita accounts , in order to retain the statutory services rendered by sita to all provincial departments .
the liberation of south africa and her people in 1994 gave rise to justified expectations and aspirations , particularly among our black brothers and sisters who for more than three centuries had suffered unparalleled oppression first under colonial and then under racist regimes .
according to evidence , the lack of clear directives on the financial implementation of the provisions of the act inter alia had the effect that - ( a ) the provisions of the act were not implemented by certain municipalities ;
although the department indicated in its application that condonation was requested in respect of expenditure amounting to r18 998 125,20 , the provincial tender board , during consideration of the matter , determined that the actual amount was r30 998 125,20 .
western cape for the year ended 31 march 1999 :
( b ) the revenue accrued during the financial years 1995 / 1996 to 1999 / 2000 , including that which has already been allocated to the provincial revenue fund during those years , be allocated / transferred to the provincial housing fund ;
mr speaker , the hon leader of the opposition clearly does not understand basic economic principles when he criticises the building of large developments , which the hon premier mentioned in his opening address and which are occurring in affluent areas .
mr speaker , i would like to conclude by reminding my comradely colleagues on that side of the house that about a third of the electorate - or somewhere round there - in this province voted for them .
mr speaker , before i begin my speech , i want to say that i have read one of the most interesting articles i have come across in a very long time , which will , in future , continue to hold great value for us from an academic , scientific and political point of view .
it is common in da circles - and the hon minister of housing mentioned it again today in reply to the hon member mr mckenzie - to accuse people of racism as soon as they mention the word " race " .
we have had democracy since 1994 and there had been people who have been in this government for much longer than that , and there still exists so much poverty and degradation that we should all hang our heads in shame .
on the one hand we have the poor working-class constituency who are only good enough to vote for them , and what they then do is to service the needs of the other constituency who control the party .
one will also discover at this magistrate 's court that a number of cases are being investigated by people who cannot speak a word of isixhosa , but these people go and investigate cases with those who can only speak isixhosa .
mr speaker , the hon leader of the opposition , and almost every other hon member on that side of the house , said that i had made no mention of the gap between rich and poor in our province .
the matter would have ended there and everything would have been fine , but the mother wrote a letter to the hon minister of education , complaining about the service rendered by the cape town school clinic .
i will allow the hon member to contact me over the lunch period and we will then decide , according to the information that he makes available to the chair , whether i will allow him to give an explanation .
these centres have been set up by women who are struggling and who have dedicated their time to run them , but no real support for these centres is evident in the plans of the hon premier when it comes to women .
that is why a minister in the house can say that she does not know what is happening , " you must come to me because you must identify your needs .
i would like to challenge each of them to think about the hon premier 's assessment of the state of the coalition government and what they believe the new np should be doing at this point in our history .
mr speaker , i rise today , not to praise the hon premier , but to contribute to the sermon at the burial of the new np / dp coalition government , for which the hon premier is also the undertaker .
having just returned from the united states of america and europe , i am saddened to report that i have never encountered such a negative perception of this country as i have now .
( b ) i pledge to continue to concentrate my energies in this regard , for as i have previously said , this is the opportunity to fund special projects within this province , with special emphasis on infrastructure .
( 3 ) is of the view that the repair of the access roads between ladismith and calitzdorp should be treated as the highest priority since that is the only access road between cape town via oudtshoorn through the little karoo to port elizabeth ; and
as soon as the doctor deposits that cheque of r100 , his account will be credited with r99,99 and , because we have a good financial institution with good structures , a 1c magtape item will immediately be deposited into a provincial revenue account .
we thank the officials who have not only done their job , but also understood the need to capacitate members , more particularly new members , and to make them understand what a budget is , how it works and so on .
political will is something that can very often be hampered because one is dealing with the tension of political will on the one hand and the will to comply with the will of those who support you on the other .
when one speaks about political will and sees how one can stretch one 's money , one asks oneself why one has two secondary schools in and around wolseley - one with nine teachers and the other with 21 teachers .
i say to the non-anc hon members in the house : it is disgraceful and despicable that the anc tries to deny the people their right to be informed and to have their say , as they did at pacaltsdorp .
a number of new role-players - a new transformation unit - has been tasked with the overarching , strategic responsibility to advise , monitor and guide reform , all with due regard to the internal management structures , cabinet and organised labour .
madam chairperson , as has already been emphasised in the house , we know that a budget is the result of a planning process , expressed in financial terms , and in no uncertain terms it ought to reflect the priorities of any operational unit .
madam chairperson , we too share the concerns expressed in the scof report about the lack of substantive progress by the hon minister in the office of the premier with regard to establishing gender , youth and disabled programmes .
i am not sure whether the chairperson of the standing committee and the members are also lying , because the hon minister said that people were lying when they said that she did not have a business plan .
the hon minister continues to whip me when i raise the problem that our children are faced with gangsterism ; that there are socio-economic problems ; that girl children are being raped and battered ; and that women in this province have no quality of life .
we do not want to fight another election without being able to come back here and tell our people that the western cape provincial government has finalised transformation and that we know exactly how we are going to tackle it in future .
they must come along and help us get this province going , because , whether they like it or not , we on this side of the house are going to make a success of this province and are going to alleviate poverty .
madam chairperson , i rise to participate in the debate on this vote with , somehow , mixed feelings , knowing that there has so often been discussion in this parliament with regard to parliament versus cabinet .
if we as public representatives are to carry out our constitutional functions and obligations to the western cape citizenry , we need to support this vote , and also to continually motivate for further budgetary increases that , in turn , will enhance our own capacity to perform .
i must say , it is very seldom that one can speak to a vote where there is an increase of 57 % , and it is one 's own vote and one does not even feel guilty about it .
let me at this stage deal with a fundamental consideration which informs our approach , the approach of this side of the house , to the budget of parliament , and that consideration is : what is the core function of parliament ?
this is so that the executive cannot interfere and tell members that if they do not comply with their requests - if they ask difficult questions , and so forth - they will interfere with their salaries .
mr speaker , in a very patronising speech three weeks ago in the house the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation spoke about a boneless wonder and said to the hon member ms brown , and i quote :
mr speaker , i will give the hon member mr dugmore the following assurance , as long as he does not make a wild allegation about a so-called allegation that i am supposed to have made , and which is not even attributed to me .
in the first week of january this year instruction was given to the state attorney , who instructed counsel , to review the legislation and to amend and correct the constitutional shortcomings .
mr speaker , i am not going to express an opinion on that , because i believe , once again , that it is for the local government to take the initiative in that regard and it is their responsibility to do so .
the question i asked the official in charge of the project was , " if i were to ask you for the names of 50 people that benefited and became entrepreneurs , would you be able to give me them ?
my department is aware of the fact that sanral is negotiating with the housing authorities to fund the construction of a pedestrian bridge over the r300 , but is not involved in the planning or execution of such a project .
he undertook to ensure that the cpos concerned were not deployed where they would be in contact with the applicants until such time as any criminal or departmental hearings against any of them had been disposed of .
it is critically important that the anc should once and for all be heard to say something that they have not said once in the taxi violence issue , that they need more police officers to protect the buses at this point .
( 1 ) whether there was a shortage of police officers at the manenberg police station on 5 april 2000 when miss south africa visited the edendale primary school ; if not , why not ; if so , what are the relevant details ;
mr speaker , there is a follow-up question : did the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism know that the department 's submission had to be used by the provincial delegation as the official submission on behalf of the western cape parliament at the ncop conference ?
mr speaker , the taxpayers are going to have to fork out , according to the hon minister of housing , r16 million to create a window-dressing senior management echelon that will appear to be representative and appear to then match the demographics of the province .
the matter is being managed on a continuous basis by a cabinet committee consisting of the hon minister of transport , sport and recreation , the hon minister of local government and development planning and i. the hon minister of finance used to participate as well .
in conclusion let me say that we have had a bit of a scrap here today , but the fact is that we need to cooperate as a provincial government , as security forces , as the national government , to protect our people .
it is difficult and it is very complex from small town to small town where one has to look at the issues and perhaps look at the dynamics and take cognisance of what the communities want .
mr speaker , we have increased our capacity in the department , and i would like to invite the hon member to perhaps spend an hour with me going through the department and have a look at what is being done .
( c ) the waiting times for patients at community health clinics have increased , but only in the metropole , partly due to the fact that we had an increase of 500 000 patients in the past year alone in this region .
a symposium on quality of care was held by the department in june this year and one of the key issues discussed was the question of addressing the long waiting times at some of our clinics and implementing corrective strategies .
it is not only against a backdrop where the fine details of the proposals on the environmental commissioner have not been tabled before scof , they have also not been tabled before the house or put to the public .
we allow one member to say that another member lies , but when he says " deliberately " or implies that the other member lies all the time - that there is intent - then that member will have to withdraw the remark .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon premier what action he and the province are taking to curb the violence that we have seen in the transport sector of the province , specifically amongst the taxi and bus drivers in khayelitsha .
madam chairperson , in closing , finance is the engine-room of our province and i believe it is collectively in very capable hands - and for the information of the hon member mr gabru , excluding me .
for too long have we failed to act with the political will required to destroy those who are planning in dark corners to deny our people that which rightfully belongs to them .
for this house today , knowing the plight of the people , to be presented with a request for permission to raise revenue , and for the anc then to object to it , is something that i will never be able to understand .
thanks to the western cape , this department was proactive and had already made all the necessary adjustments in the department of finance and put the necessary mechanisms in place in order to be able to adjust when the public finance management act has to be implemented .
i said here - i have said this at scof on a number of occasions , and previously in the house - that i would come up in my 100-day policies with a proposal to cabinet on how our procurement policy should be changed .
i therefore apologise , i believe , to scof by saying to them that i cannot comply with my five-month undertaking because of the new act , but i will comply with it as soon as the regulations come into play .
] now , this is hardly conducive to adequate rehabilitation of prisoners and is further proof of a national ministry in such disarray that it is threatening the fabric of society and our people in the western cape .
sir , since police play such an important role in society in combating crime and ensuring safety , it is even more true in the western cape since this province is saddled with an extremely bad crime problem .
there has also been little or no visibility of the success of these programmes in the coloured or black townships , and this is the problem that the majority of the people who voted for us are experiencing .
when we originally spoke about community police officers - that is why the original contract was for a three-month period - the idea was that those people would be incorporated into a municipal police service or the saps , depending on their choice .
hon members have my assurance that my directorate will in the meantime be hosting a meeting of all sports codes in the region to discuss the future of the national sport council in the western cape and its role with respect to the department and sport codes .
if we do not ensure that our children are physically active in their formative years , they will not develop a culture of physical exercise and we shall pay the price in future years via increasing needs for costly healthcare .
in particular emphasis is placed on presenting sport and recreation at community festivals , community sporting projects , summer and winter games , and youth camps where volunteers are trained to help the directorate to present programmes in the communities in cooperation with the directorate .
first of all , as regards the hon member mr stali 's contribution about the facilities audit , i draw his attention to my speech , where i said that we are doing a facilities audit and that we have a database of facilities .
i have instructed the hon minister of social services and poverty relief to produce a full report on the situation in homes for the aged under the control of the provincial government on a regular basis .
this will entail a fundamental restructuring of our departmental head office and nine area offices to improve our management systems and enable us to do more with less and , in particular , to provide a better service to our schools .
the wced inherited a structure that supported a highly centralised model of management , which contradicts the essential thrust of the south african schools act that schools and their communities should accept greater responsibility for their growth and development .
mr chairperson , this house is aware that we have implemented the norms and standards for the funding of schools , in terms of which the poorest public schools are now receiving seven times more than the least poor public schools in three expenditure categories .
mr chairperson , i would like to briefly examine our six critical success factors in terms of the progress we have made in the last eight months , and the progress we hope to make in the next 12 months .
there is still disturbing evidence in some schools that this disease is not being taken seriously , and we will do whatever we can to ensure that our learners take responsibility for their health status and that of others .
however , if one examines the nature of this change in more detail , it does seem , at both national and provincial level , that the policy-makers have not taken into account the full complexity of the change process in educational institutions .
however , i am pleased to report that the department is looking at a solution for rietvlei school by moving it into a building supplied by the vukani training centre near mossel bay .
if we look at the figures for our community and in south africa , if we look at scientists and engineers , we have only 3,3 % out of every 100 000 in the population , while the usa has 21,5 % and japan 7,1 % .
i would just like to bring to the hon minister 's attention a letter one of the parents wrote me about a particular setwork book recommended by the education department , master harold and the boys by athol fugard .
while many of our teachers are completely floundering because they do not understand what they must do and they do not have learning materials to guide them , we are going to find that the legacy of this intended reform may be very serious indeed .
i should very much have like the standing committee to be far more active and to be seen far more in our hospitals by paying calls there so that they may boost the morale of our staff a little .
the project will be phased in over three financial years and piloted in vredendal - i am sorry that my colleague from vredendal is not here - at a projected cost of approximately r200 000 in this financial year .
mr chairperson , the greatest gift a person can give to this country is to be part of a south africa where we can create a home , a community and a world where all children can feel secure , supported and loved .
we now have cinderella , this poor step-child in the office of the premier , trying to grasp the elusive and very expensive magic carpet - r10 million to be exact - and steer it on an unknown course .
that the house requests the responsible authority to inform members in writing of all amenities and recreational facilities available in the provincial parliament , and to make keys available to all parties to allow access to the facilities .
when we think of all those achievements , and keep in mind the housing need that still exists in the province , i believe that everyone will admit that the achievements do not even make a dent in the existing needs that we have to address .
people often stand on platforms and tell the audience that the national government gives only r15 000 or r17 000 to develop a house , and that a , b and c can be done with that r15 000 or r17 000 .
an amount of r27 million has been allocated for 62 water projects ; r9,4 million for 15 road-building projects ; r17,2 million for 46 sewerage projects ; r13 million for 18 storm-water projects ; r7,4 million for 20 street-lighting projects ; r1,8 million for two taxi rank projects ; and r3,6 million for 11 garbage dumps .
if we can put any agreements between the trade unions and the local government in place before the election - we are all aiming for 1 november for the election - i think it can be sustained after the local government election .
madam speaker , after listening to the hon minister of local government , and i have said this earlier , i am reminded of the old saying that goes , " show me your friends and i can tell who you are " .
madam chairperson , instead of fixing what is genuinely broken - most of it being in the eastern cape - the anc wants to fix that which is not broken , mainly in this province , i am pleased to say .
( 1 ) notes that today , almost six years after the establishment of democracy in our country and province , a more representative and meaningful deployment of members of the saps to this provincial parliament takes place ;
if hon members want the cooperation of other hon members in the house , it may be a good thing , if they feel it is not controversial , to make it available to the whips of the various parties .
( 1 ) notes that today , almost six years after the establishment of democracy in our country and province , a more representative and meaningful deployment of members of the saps to this provincial parliament takes place ;
owing to the uncertainty that existed in the western cape farming community about the subdivision of farm land to provide for the long-term settlement of farm workers , consultants were appointed at the end of 1996 to compile a policy on this matter .
] in the absence of the metropolitan spatial development framework , we face the danger that ad hoc decisions will be taken by these four inmates tomorrow , and those decisions will have a long-term effect on the development of the metropolitan area .
i must , however , caution the house that the workload of this component increases exponentially each year , as i have said , and we could end up stifling development and employment if we do not review the budgetary requirements of this unit .
this week is international water week , and south africa was one of the first signatories to the ramsar convention , but the estuaries of the western cape , particularly in the cape flats , are among the most threatened and polluted and the most unprotected ecosystems in south africa .
my big concern , and it is one i have expressed year in and year out when we have dealt with the cultural budget , is the management of funding in the province , especially in a province where there are limited resources .
mr speaker , after the implementation of the western cape nature conservation board , act 15 of 1998 , it became clear that certain amendments to various laws on nature conservation were necessary without fundamentally changing the essence thereof .
the applicant can get the forms from any municipal licensing authority and , once completed , these forms , together with the payment , are sent to the province for verification and the manufacturing of the plates , which are then sent to the applicant .
i should also like to thank those who did not participate and who helped to arouse emotions because we did not have a monotonous debate , but one that we will be able to read for many years yet .
i ask him not to go back to kwazulu-natal , but to stay in the western cape so that we can call on him if we need him and employ him for a few days !
the court further ruled that , whereas the province was not precluded from regulating wholesale and producers ' licences , the national government was indeed competent to regulate trade issues , such as the regulation of competition , in relation to these activities .
i know the problems at national level , and with the time period involved , but even with a two-month time lapse , getting 26 section 28 ( 1 ) certificates in three years does not sound right to me .
however , i am still trying to get an explanation why we have to stay in the most expensive hotel in ireland , and why there are differentials about the amount of money that people receive - and some people actually have to pay from their pocket .
the predominant impression i gained from the speech by the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism today is that he has developed into a fine art the ability to take credit for the work and initiatives of others .
i am also tempted to deviate from my prepared speech to react to some of the woolly arguments presented by the hon member mr winde about the liquor licensing processes , but i will resist that temptation .
one of these indications was the reply by the hon minister to a question i asked earlier about the composition of local tourism bureaux and what the hon minister envisaged doing to make them more representative .
i will never forget the analogy that the hon minister made in his 100-day address when he informed the house that for every r1 that the provincial government invests in agriculture , r100 's worth of agricultural products are sold .
extrapolating information from dosmi in 1994 , one will see the gross income received from agricultural production is approximately r9,8 billion , which is an average of r884 000 per farmer - much higher figures in this case .
if we are silent about that in our policy document and in our budget then by implication it is assumed that when we speak about upliftment in agriculture then we are thinking about the needs of men and not necessarily the needs of women .
madam chairperson , agriculture provides employment to 14 % of the economically active population and is the main provider of employment in the rural areas , but the insensitive working set-up has meant that over the past five years the labour force has virtually been halved .
( 1 ) the joy and feelings of victory by the people of atlantis , pella , mamre , and witsand after the discontinuance of the practice of charging entrance fees at silwerstroom beach by the new np-controlled blaauwberg municipality ;
i have instructed the hon minister of social services and poverty relief to produce a full report on the situation in homes for the aged under the control of the provincial government on a regular basis .
our appeal is that the hon minister should use the amending act as a negotiating mechanism in an effort to contain the taxi violence , rather than to implement it vigorously , and prevent innocent people from possibly getting hurt in the process .
for instance , in his statement dealing with this crisis , issued in the absence of the hon minister of transport and works , the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation saw fit to introduce the recapitalisation issue .
it is necessary for the parties in the house today to say this , or else we shall allow this kind of heritage to continue for bianca , amelia and the other people after them - let us not make a joke of this .
mr speaker , south africa is fast becoming a nation of killers and rapists protected against the wrath of their victims , by a constitution not fit for the times to deal effectively with criminals .
community organisations can do a great deal , but after my experience at grassroots level and on the basis of discussions with people , i think that if the hearts of the people at grassroots level do not change , we will not find a lasting solution .
i think that the one challenge that we are faced with in the country and in our province is to educate our communities about the rights and responsibilities of establishing a culture of human rights in the country .
it is a pity to mention this this afternoon , but how can one partially blame people in the community out there for the establishment of a human rights culture when even we here do not understand what a human rights culture really is ?
the point is that those hon members were the ones that took to the streets ; they were the ones that ran down everything that was good ; they were the ones that stood on the streets ; and they were the ones that misled the children .
for the sake of clarity i am going to read to him my answer of two paragraphs and leave the matter at that , with a warning to him and to any other hon member that we will follow the correct procedure if we are unhappy .
madam chairperson , in the light of the fact that the hon minister of finance and development planning quoted a figure of 787 000 voters registered in the process , could we ask how he arrived at that figure ?
madam chairperson , i cannot answer the full question , but the r4 000 was spent in terms of section 37 ( 2 ) ( c ) of the public service act on a decision taken by the cabinet on 17 february 1999 .
madam chairperson , on a point of order : i think that the only reason why we are going through this exercise and the hon premier 's lecturing us on this is because scof had chosen not to do this kind of work .
was he satisfied in november last year when this was put forward as a schedule that he was going to save that money and would not need it for the rest of the four or five months still coming in the financial year ?
what is very serious - and the hon minister of finance and development planning should take note of this - is that we have heard that when the money for voter registration was approved , an agreement was entered into with the provincial treasury .
it has been my long held belief that only a coordinated and an integrated approach by the different levels of government , together with all the law enforcement agencies , will succeed in putting the breaks on crime in our country and in our province .
i think that is the motivation behind the grants that will be terminated , that the state would want us to encourage our people to be involved in education to enable them to employ themselves .
what we heard yesterday tells a story of dedication , of determination , of commitment , of vision , of caring , of inspirational teamwork , of success , of discipline , of fiscal discipline and simply of hard work ; yes , it tells of time on task .
mr speaker , having listened to the speech of the hon premier it is clear that the da must be in the running for the prize for the political party that forgot about its election promises in the shortest possible time .
in the light of the recent research findings from the usa that caution needs to be exercised in the implementation of these programmes , it has been shown that some of the antiretroviral agents cause harmful and toxic side-effects , such as blood dyscrasias .
yesterday during his opening address the hon premier also stated that we were also meeting in the knowledge that the confidence and trust of the public in much of the political leadership of our country is plummeting .
that is slavery , taking into account the fact that this labour consultant , against whom the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works has not expressed a single word of condemnation - and there are a number of them operating - sold the people at r200 a piece .
we have , again in a spirit of cooperation , agreed to the report in its present form , although our original reservations were expressed in a much stronger form , namely that we feel strongly about the question of repeatedly rolling over funds .
if one takes note of the various votes , at least in terms of the white book itself , one will see that about r1 million of moneys voted in this appropriation is actually being voted in order to alleviate the deteriorating exchange rate .
mr speaker , i want to remind the house that at the beginning of the government in 1999 there was great fanfare about the establishment of a poverty relief desk that was meant to coordinate the activities of various departments .
when we asked this question the department responded that they are busy drawing up this list and all further expenditure on cameras will be based on the priority list of areas where there is the most need .
that the house condemns the wave of corruption and nepotism in the country and the appointment by the anc of unqualified people to high positions in the public service , and therefore calls on the president to urgently address this matter .
the hon minister of transport will know that there are only six members on the board and the national transport ( co-ordination ) amendment act , act 73 of 1977 , makes provision for the public to nominate people to the board .
but these children , supported by their parents , have been determined to get to school , and i have seen them pouring over the mew way bridge in khayelitsha on a regular basis to go and meet a bus .
during the last debate on taxi violence that we had in this house , the udm pleaded that the hon minister of transport and works resume negotiation and discussions and that he use the legislation that has been passed as a mechanism for negotiation .
mr speaker , i want to conclude by expressing my concern about the fact that i feel that the hon minister - and this applies to all hon ministers in the house - do not use the tremendous potential in standing committees .
] the hon member would like the convention centre , but he shows a remarkable disinterest in , and lack of appreciation of and support for the actual creation of a project which is in many senses the modern equivalent of a cathedral .
madam chairperson , the hon member ms essop did not motivate her amendment , but i did refer to it in my reply and explained why i would very strongly urge the house not to accept it .
when we discussed the amendment in the committee meeting - and the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism must not say i am distorting what happened in the committee meeting - we accepted it .
consideration be given to the referral , in addition to the prescribed reporting and follow-up procedure , of incidents of fraud and irregularities to the heath special investigating unit in view of the special powers at their disposal for the recovery of misappropriated funds ; and
the first aspect that is important is that in terms of section 155 ( 1 ) of the national constitution there will be three categories of municipalities in south africa : category a , a metropolitan municipality ; category b , a local municipality ; and category c , a district municipality .
this fact seems to have escaped the ministry or the minister responsible for tourism who , in drafting the western cape tourism bill , has intruded in an unwarranted fashion upon an area or functional responsibility of local government .
if i can give him some advice , he should sit down with the hon minister of local government so that he can be enlightened on the new functions and the new relative autonomy of local government .
sir , i think that the framework of reference of any judge - and i am not referring to his academic framework and competences , but to his life experience - when he hears a case , plays a decisive role in the ultimate finding in a court case .
mr speaker , the point that i am making is that the independence of the judiciary is not only about courts and magistrates ' courts and things of that nature , but also about certain instruments of justice in this country , such as the human rights commission .
i then thought that he would take it a step further , but he did not get to the reason - and now he is going to tell me his time expired - why he joined the anc .
the woman who is in charge of the business , jackie thomas , had to get a friend to put up her house as collateral and apply for a personal loan so that they could obtain capital to start their business .
the best example that i can use of a place in the world where they have successfully turned this around is ireland , where the government came in and said , " firstly , we will act as a bank in our own right .
2.1 according to the auditor-general 's report the department requested approval from the western cape provincial tender board to deviate from obtaining advertised tenders in respect of the procurement of a high-speed photocopy machine needed for the reproduction of examination papers .
( 3 ) that the national department of environmental affairs and tourism , the provincial department of environmental and cultural affairs , the western cape nature conservation board , various local governments , sanccob and other ngos were quickly mobilised in a joint action to deal with this disaster ; and
and , as an hon member said to us a year ago , they also had to pay community facilities ' accounts , they had to pay an administration fee and they also had to contribute towards the salaries of officials in townships , and i can go on and on .
madam speaker , with compassion the government is going to say to the ratepayers of clifton , " we will not hit you at once with this increase ; we will allow it to be phased in over a period not exceeding three years .
we have a moral and regulatory duty to protect the man in the street against unscrupulous operators , and i immediately think of the illegal gambling operations that take place not only in the province but also in the country as a whole .
in a casino a gambling employee such as a dealer has the ability to influence the outcome of a game , whilst a gambling employee working in the horse-racing environment merely records bets on what amounts to a computerised betting and accounting system .
mr speaker , there are a number of other technical amendments to the law , all of which are intended to enhance the powers of the board so as to advance the effective and efficient regulation of the gambling industry in the western cape .
mr speaker , the fact that the ceo commissioned an audit after telling the council that the issues raised by mr van niekerk had been dealt with was in itself a matter for concern .
mr speaker , if i look at the speakers ' list , i want to say that there is something serious happening in the house in the way the house has been devalued and degraded by the new np and the dp .
mr speaker , i would have thought that after almost 15 years in politics the hon member mr mckenzie would know what a point of order is but , as usual , he does not know what is going on here .
as a member of the executive council , the hon minister is governed by the constitution , the highest legislation in the land , and he is governed by the executive members ' ethics act as promulgated in 1998 .
section 136 ( 2 ) ( c ) goes on to say that one may not use one 's position or any information entrusted to one to enrich oneself or improperly benefit any other person .
surely it would be in his own interests and to his own benefit , and the interests of this house and the government , for the credibility and integrity of the process of developing a convention centre not to be questioned .
mr speaker , we then said we should go further than what is stated in the companies act and we should undress ourselves completely of any interest we may have and put it on the table .
parliament will soon consider giving effect to muslim personal law and even the ruling party in this country , the anc , received more votes from muslims than any other party did , including the muslim parties .
i believe , and i have no information to the contrary , that the attack on the samaj centre last week was an attack on the hon premier as an official of the state and the most senior one in this province .
then we make a mockery of this house , because the house makes the laws which the security forces must enforce , and if they do not enforce them , one does not have a democratic state , and one does not have the rule of law .
mr speaker , the motion before the house - and i am essentially dealing with item ( 3 ) of this motion - deeply offends me , the dignity of the house and the sensitivities and morality of the general public .
( 1 ) that the motion by mr d silke on the william cooper document distributed by the national minister of health , which was printed on the order paper , was withdrawn minutes before the sitting of this house today ;
( 1 ) congratulates the blue downs community police forum and the national minister of water affairs and forestry on launching a successful campaign of bush clearing in various dangerous areas where children such as jaqueline smith have lost their lives ; and
( 1 ) urgently calls on the minister of health for a report on the implementation of the health information system with a view to establishing the reasons for the long delay and the cost implications thereof ; and
owing to the fact that this parliament will soon be in recess and that the first authorisation of expenditure took place on 25 july 2000 , i am compelled to present this estimate today in order to comply with the act .
this interference by the anc in the behaviour patterns of individuals , who do not serve agriculture , is once again evidence of a lack of a well-considered investigation by the anc into the relationship between the employers and employees on farms .
( ii ) report of authorisation in terms of sections 25 ( 4 ) ( a ) and 25 ( 5 ) of the public finance management act ( pfma ) ( act 1 of 1999 ) , dated 30 august 2000 , as follows :
in view of the forthcoming local government elections it is of the utmost importance that the legal opinion be obtained within 30 days of this report and a copy be provided to the committee by the provincial administration ; and
in view of the forthcoming local government elections it is of the utmost importance that the legal opinion be obtained within 30 days of this report , and a copy be provided to the committee by the provincial administration .
whilst taking cognisance of the fact that this aspect now forms an integral part of the department 's training program and that the responsible official has been reprimanded , the committee still wishes to once again express its dissatisfaction at the disregard of tender board directives .
many ministers said that they knew it was the truth because their officials had provided them with the information ; they had a very good working relationship with their officials and they had told them that it was the truth .
the proof of the pudding is in the eating , and the proof of the pudding is that what we did in order to increase the total percentage of people in this province and put them on the lists so that they could vote was the correct thing .
our macroeconomic strategy , the enormous achievements with respect to international trade negotiations which , by the way , have had a massive positive impact on the western cape , the drive for better tax collection and against corruption , and many others are not even mentioned .
mr speaker , it is a fact that if we had had this pre-emptive right from the first day , the loan sharks in the microlending industry , the shebeen owners and all the other unscrupulous people would not have had the chance to purchase them .
mr chairperson , i want to refer the hon premier to an article in the latest edition of politikon 27 ( 2 ) 2000 , and for those who do not read the publication , it is an organ of the south african political sciences association .
if we were to listen to that side of the house continually , the western cape is not part of south africa ; the western cape does not suffer from the problems of the rest of south africa and therefore those problems are not our problems .
is he going to continue to follow the line of the unicity mayor , peter marais , who has the audacity to say that the president of this country lived in luxury in exile while people were suffering here ?
secondly , in spite of the criticisms of the best efforts of this side of the house , the government after 18 months as a coalition government and six months as the da government , has been accepted by the voters of the western cape .
our second question - and i am giving hon members the facts - is why they said that they did not want to share in the da 's failure in the council and did not want to accept responsibility .
in my opinion the next reason for their not wanting to participate is that they thought that they could make a very strong moral and possibly also legal point , and thereby exclude the da in the other provinces .
i want to ask them now to recognise the integrity of the department of home affairs and the iec and not to think that they are a bunch of feeble people who will automatically jump when we tell them to jump .
we also understand why that is so , because if one looks at the reports of the anc 's structures over the weekend , one thing is clear : the anc 's structures are collapsing here in the western cape .
the success of this province will largely depend on whether we , in our different departments , our environment out there and our personal daily lives , can continue to honour , respect and maintain the norms and standards of decent and civilised value systems .
what the hon premier did to deal with the race issue was to sack the previous chairperson of the standing committee on public accounts for having dealt with the non-representivity of african and coloured people in the western cape .
when i asked him why he did not give more money to the police - and he has another budget coming up , a real test - he asked me why we did not redeploy the resources better .
we who are sitting here today are all aware that the hon premier spoke about the successes of the western cape - its economic boom , tourism potential , low unemployment figures and so on - when he delivered his opening address on 8 february 2000 .
on behalf of the agriculturists and the rural community , i want to thank him for caring about the people of the western cape , and for motivating the cabinet to perform in this province and to work for the people of the western cape .
this province is committed to the interests of the poorest of the poor , but will continue to apply the " hand up " as against the " hand down " principle , as enunciated by the hon premier .
however , i have not been able to award a higher level of expenditure to community safety , but i am of the opinion that with the advent of casino taxation revenues starting to flow , a portion of this must be channelled for this purpose .
to some extent the western cape had it tougher than most , since in the interests of attaining equity in our country we were on the receiving end of relatively fewer transfers from the national fiscus .
it seems that the anc 's lust for power in the western cape overrides every consideration of principle , any acknowledgement of the truth and all regard for the spirit of reconciliation the people of our country and our province desire .
if we levy 0,01 % of that amount - which we are proposing in the house today - it means that 1c out of every r100 that is spent will be a levy , or r10 out of every r10 000 .
it is a breath of fresh air in the way in which it departs from the old function committee system , which largely was a lottery system and a case of who could lobby the best and so on , and it allows the kind of planning and prioritising years in advance .
i believe that criticism is due if the anc had come along to me and made suggestions as to what they believe should be in the budget and i then refuse to do it or i am unable to do it .
among the important programmes being planned for this financial year are the following : the development of user-friendly procedures and manuals ; the sensitisation and briefing of staff by workshops ; the active participation in central and provincial bargaining processes ; and the training of negotiators .
much of the debate in this regard , and of course it is relevant to this department , comes from my colleagues on that side of the house , who are seeking to reimpose apartheid-style quotas in our province and the country as a whole .
mr chairperson , a couple of months ago i put it very directly to the hon minister in the office of the premier that disabled people cannot enter this building through the front door ; they have to enter through the garage .
r1,5 million has been budgeted for internal communication as well as communication from the province to the voters so that there may be ongoing transparency in respect of what we are doing in the province and so that the information can be conveyed to the people at large .
sir , we cannot make plans time and again and place plans on the table and then be accused from outside that this province is slow with transformation and that we are not interested in transforming people .
i am a cricketer , and i know that one first bats and puts enough runs on the board before one declares , but those hon members did not even bat today , so their leader declared that they supported the budget .
while this is naturally a matter for the rules committee , which is known as the guiding authority of parliament , to consider in depth , i think it would be a good thing briefly to give an overview of the motivation for raising the argument .
these motions , in some instances , attempted to demonstrate that there is a separation and , of course , independence between cabinet and parliament , emphasising the role that parliament has to play in its oversight role over the executive .
i would not like to mention the names of staff members , but to the secretary of parliament , the deputy secretaries , and every single staff member we offer our sincere congratulations and would also like to thank them in advance for the work that lies ahead .
we should , also i feel , look after our own interests . after all , we do not know how long it will be before each of us is also a former member who might well want to enjoy a privilege or whatever else here .
i therefore asked mr west to show me the nature and pace of development , advise me of conservation and development projects and the public attitude in the southern cape area , including , inter alia , the ballots bay project .
the hon premier cannot have it both ways and he cannot allow his ministers to embarrass him in the manner that the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs has done .
whether he is engaged in a process of changing the institutional framework with regard to the development agencies in the province ; if so , ( a ) what is the process that has been adopted in this regard and ( b ) what proposals have been finalised ?
mr speaker , i would like to know from the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs why the hon premier delegated this matter to the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation while it will more naturally fall under his portfolio .
due to these factors , as well as the time which had elapsed between 1993 and 1999 , the department recommended that the emp should be comprehensively revised to ensure it became relevant to the current operation of the resort at grotto bay .
due to the proactive preventative steps taken by the provincial his management committee these additional costs that can be quantified are limited to only the costs pertaining to the updating of the current chs ( cape hospital system ) for y2k compliance : ...
if there is no format , then i ask that you please attend to it or ask the whips to attend to it , because it seems to me as if some of the hon members regard this as a joke .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon premier to outline his key objectives and goals for his forthcoming official visit to the people 's republic of china and what direct benefits does he envisage for the people of the western cape .
on 10 may 2000 during an executive committee meeting the matter was again brought to the attention of the council and it was decided that the council 's branch : nature conservation would carry out regular patrols in order to ensure that the agreement was kept .
we are bolstering a senior management echelon , and on top of that we have information that , in fact , some of the posts currently filled by white men at a senior level , which we challenged last year , will be upgraded to superintendent-general level .
this was done in terms of regulations promulgated by the hon minister of transport , sport and recreation , in terms of the powers entrusted to him in the western cape road transportation act amendment bill , 2000 ( act 7 of 2000 ) .
whether any applications for scoping reports and environmental impact assessments were submitted to the department between 1 january 1999 and 1 july 2000 ; if so , ( a ) how many ( b ) how many have been approved and ( c ) how many are still awaiting approval ?
but it is as well to remember that we are still doing over 120 replacements a year at groote schuur hospital alone and we are doing that despite the avalanche of trauma and reducing budgets in the associated academic hospitals .
mr speaker , if the hon member mr dugmore had listened to my answer , he would have understood when i said that the amount would be retrieved in accordance with - in case he does not know - existing treasury instructions .
mr speaker , all i wish to say is - and i repeat it again - i am committed to bringing in a proper empowerment policy in so far as the tender procedures in the province are concerned ; i have given those undertakings .
( d ) the pharmacy advisory committee has been formed under the chairmanship of the head of health with its aim being to improve the physical conditions of pharmacies , to try to improve the conditions of service for staff and to improve service delivery .
i have been advised by the western cape tourism board that they were in no way involved in initiating , financing , arranging , inviting speakers , marketing or any other aspect of the tourism conference held at spier on 26 september 2000 and organised by omega conferences .
mr speaker , would the hon minister then concede that the publicity material of omega misled the public of the western cape , in stipulating clearly that the workshop was organised in association with the western cape tourism board ?
hon members heard what the hon minister of local government said yesterday - and i agree with what he said - that we as a government have a responsibility to ensure that that money is properly spent .
( 1 ) whether any properties in the form of houses and flats belong to the province ; if so , ( a ) how many , ( b ) how many people stay in such properties , ( c ) how much does each person pay in rental or lease ;
the reality is that until a month ago , when the gate was put on the beach , the hon member ms versfeld 's family and other families who have access to that beach were responsible for destroying the dune vegetation .
( a ) requests the minister of finance and development planning to institute a research project in order to investigate the possibility of a levy on all economic activity or any other method of generating additional revenue in the western cape ; and
a private debt collector has also been appointed by education with effect from 1 november 1999 for a period of one year , to assist in the recovery of outstanding education bursaries which stood at r18 million at the end of last september .
i think it is fitting to say that the wind of a change in attitude is really blowing with regard to the budget reform process in this province , which has always been influenced by the anc and directed by the national government .
madam chairperson , the hon minister of finance and development planning said in his speech that this budget was meant and tailored for the poorest of the poor , but allocated a rolled-over r10 million towards what he called poverty relief .
now i come to the hon member mr strachan , who talked about national competency on taxes , and that is why he feels that there should be a debate on the question of the hon member mr louis 's motion .
it is alleged that comm niel van heerden is a person who punches with his fist ; someone who engages in drunken driving , someone who is alleged to be very talented in a pub ; and a man who is said to cause accidents , and then tries to hurry away from the scene .
i venture to suggest that those members who were watching the bold and the beautiful when the hon minister of education came to visit them in guguletu will not make the grade unless protected by their friends in popcru .
mr chairperson , i wish to link up with the previous speakers who thanked the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation and his management team on an outstanding budget vote as submitted to the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling and to the house .
in this regard our representations to the central government must not be regarded as emanating from a mendicant mentality , but instead should be seen in the light of serious concerns about the growing crime wave that is spilling over to the western cape from other provinces .
the community police officers have been in existence for almost five years - four years and seven months , i think - but no direction has been given with regard to the end product that we want to have in respect of these men and women .
where we have influence over the sponsors , like local authorities and the cmc who contributed r5 million , we had negotiations and the vast majority of the cpos sponsored by them are in the affected areas .
i would also like to say to the hon minister that we should not underestimate the calibre of our local talent , regarding people like clive rice , vince van der bijl , gary bailey , lucas radebe and those , when it comes to training .
it is within the scope of the provincial commission of inquiry into the cape peninsula fires to make recommendations , not only on disaster management , but also on land management practices which can be implemented to avert similar tragedies in the future .
just like president mbeki , i am confident that there is the will to work together to ensure that these elections will be held in conditions of peace and peaceful political competition and that they are free and fair .
we should make 200 days per year of full teaching and learning time the basic minimum , irrespective of sports competitions , choir competitions , visits by international development experts , handing over of prizes , st john 's ambulance events , water week , arbour day or any other events which may intervene .
mr chairperson , the other day when i visited matric classes at a high school in which the matric results were absolutely dismal last year , i found the matric maths class sitting idle because their teacher had gone off to a ussasa meeting to plan a sports event .
in the forthcoming year we have budgeted some r71 million , an increase of almost r30 million - thanks to the " dobbel dividend " that we received from the casino licensing process - and for this i wish to thank the hon minister of finance and development planning .
he spoke about transformation and the fact that it must happen within a department , but i would like to add that i really believe that political will can give an enormous momentum and constructiveness to that transformation within a department .
despite the fact that much negative publicity has been given to many aspects of education , which is probably inevitable during a period of transition , and in particular one which has undergone such radical changes simultaneously , education in this province appears to be healing .
i have to point out that today is commonwealth day , and announce that all branches of the commonwealth parliamentary association have received a message by her majesty the queen as the head of the commonwealth , and that message will be tabled today .
we have earmarked r7,3 million more to combat the spread of hiv / aids , in addition to any additional allocations which we may receive , such as from the amounts announced by the national minister of finance in his budget speech earlier this month .
i can proudly announce that with the opening of the vanguard community health centre between bonteheuwel and langa later this year , the branch : health , thanks to the good work of all my predecessors , will operate no fewer than 17 24-hour emergency facilities in the metropolitan area .
concerning the bashings , as dr lawrence described them , especially in the national standing committee on health last week , i can only say that challenges like that may seem unfair at the time , but one comes out of them stronger .
whilst the process of downsizing over the past four years has led to this achievement , what is regrettable is that the losses have been at the regional level and amongst nursing staff , so much so that there is a now a shortage of some 1 000 nurses .
the department has been cut to the bone over the past four years , with a drop of expenditure in real terms of just under 10 % and a loss of over 9 000 staff , or 27 % of the workforce .
the other key issue of the budget and of the changing system of health care , besides revenue retention , is retaining autonomy at hospitals , and enabling hospitals to manage themselves and look after their own particular issues with expertise .
this brings the house to the point where it should ask what kind of monitoring system there is to see whether the medication in the hospitals is actually distributed to the patients in the way that it is supposed to be .
national government made available an amount of r2 million for the marketing of the child support grant , but there are only 6 778 children registered for the child support grant at present in comparison to the 59 000 people receiving the maintenance grant .
" i want to add that i am equally embarrassed about the absence of a business plan , but i wish to state categorically that i had no part in the lack of a business plan that should have been established for the poverty relief desk .
the fact that the project in crossroads is working so well that people are walking away with between r700 and r800 a month , leads me to feel that we should use that project as a basis in other communities to start developing income-generation groups .
the most successful nations and regions of the world have been those able to maintain and expand healthy economies , while also giving even their poorest and weakest citizens access to opportunities to succeed .
in her 100-day vision speech in september , 1999 the hon minister in the office of the premier , after once again stringing together a great many words - simply rhetoric - stated that she was talking about the establishment of focal units .
if we do not claim damages and put up an effective case , then we will have charlatans and all manner of quick-buck people coming to us and trying to get their hands on that r1,8 billion , which is public money .
perhaps we should assign this hon minister the task of drawing up regulations in terms of which the waiting-lists would be put in the hands of the department , which could then scramble those lists , as we did with the housing waiting-lists .
that is something that we have to be able to change , and i am hoping that the model that the hon minister spoke about actually goes far enough to make more of our rands actually reach those who should be the beneficiaries .
i will expand later on the road ahead , but allow me first the privilege of sharing a few bits and pieces with hon members regarding the progress and achievements in respect of housing in the province over the past year .
hon members , when addressing us today , the leader of the house expressed the desire that we should look at rules 43 and 44 regarding talking and allowing other hon members to be heard .
i was disturbed by what i saw when i was doing my research on housing in areas such as du noon , where one still finds poor people being paid r30 to r40 per day to work for these developers .
i want to know whether there is any kind of claim being made and whether the hon minister has been mandated to prosecute the matter , rather than say that he is waiting for the court to claim the money from these developers .
i think it is unfair to label a council that had the courage to look after the poor , while the others just live on the fat of the money that they receive , and say how feeble they are .
they were probably quite right to point fingers at me , and angry fingers at that , and to ask me why they had not been accommodated in the unicity commission or in the district transformation forum .
therefore , in order to preserve representative natural areas and the character of the coast , and in order to ensure sustainable development , a negotiated provincial policy for guiding and reconciling development with conservation needed to be formulated as a matter of urgency .
furthermore , such policy needed to be informed by bioregional planning principles , which refer to the integrated relationship between ecological processes and the needs and perceptions of local communities , and are generally recognised as being central to the achievement of sustainable development .
provincial planning is only aimed at the synchronisation or reconciliation of the various departmental business plans within the broad objectives of the provincial strategic plan , which was previously known as the provincial growth and development strategy and subsequently the provincial integrated development plan .
one of the most important things - someone else raised this as well - the department is achieving , is moving amongst municipalities , especially smaller municipalities , and giving training and support in the country areas .
conservation remains a central focus of my administration on the basis of section 24 ( b ) in the constitution which provides that people have the right " to have the environment protected , for the benefit of present and future generations " .
more seriously , we would like to add our thanks to those of the chairperson of the standing committee to dr kane-berman for the good work that she has done in the department and we wish her well on her retirement .
as far as i know the issue of budgets does not even come into it , because in the standing committee i asked whether an assessment had been done and whether it would be cheaper to outsource it or to do it in-house .
i want to place on record here that the anc has one attribute that makes it far greater than any other political party that exists in this province and this country , and that is its ability to apologise when it makes mistakes .
now , firstly , in lighter vein i must question the moral standing of this organisation , but then i really do want to know what this has to do with the hon minister 's department and the funding of culture and cultural activities in this province .
according to the report in the hermanus times , the hermanus municipal council decided at a general meeting that the referendum question would be whether the voters were in favour of controlled opening of the klein river mouth or were totally opposed to it .
mr speaker , after the western cape nature conservation laws amendment bill was referred to the standing committee on education , environmental and cultural affairs , i have pleasure in reporting that the bill was unanimously accepted by all the members in the committee .
mr speaker , the aim of the amendment being submitted here today is to promote ownership and create the opportunity for certain houses that are currently being rented to be transferred to those people 's names so that they can take ownership of them .
mr speaker , i hereby tender my apologies for the late presentation of this bill , but the reasons , as i enumerated earlier , are because of the public finance management act and the necessity to bring it in .
one thing i would like the hon minister to do when it comes to the mta is to intervene in this critical matter and see what can be done to get transport on the go .
madam chairperson , now that the national land transport bill is waiting to be passed in the ncop , we hope the standing committee will finalise the western cape transport administration act , the transport planning act , the transport regulations act and the roads management act .
i want to be honest - and i hope the department of works regards this as constructive comment - and say that when i visited the ministerial suites on the seventh floor , i was tremendously disappointed with the design and the layout there .
the r79 million received from the casino fund , we divided up in such a way that we could fix some of the infrastructure which thus far we had not been able to do as a result of money which had been taken from us in the previous budget .
if , for example , we adjourn for a muslim holy day , and an hon member wishes the muslims a good day or a holy day , in all honesty and sincerity , no one should involve politics in a motion of that kind .
it is that after a motion has been edited administratively , then that is the motion which appears on the order paper , not necessarily the one read by the hon member in question in the house , about which there may be objections to a word or two .
the stark reality of this challenge is underlined by the recent announcement by central statistical services that the number of formal jobs in our economy has now fallen back to levels that prevailed at the end of the 1970s - two decades ago .
one can do the bricks and mortar analysis , looking at , for example , the computer plant and the carpets - at everything that has been spent - but the value of a property is what the tenant is prepared to pay .
i would like to thank the staff of the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism 's department , although it would have been very nice to see a more representative group here , especially ms nhlumayo , given that tourism is such a topical issue .
madam chairperson , let me reassure the hon leader of the opposition on that - i think the convention is that the fare ai not served before the host arrives .
in order to stay in the forefront of technological developments in agriculture and thus stay on top of the treadmill , we are currently in the process of embarking on a number of joint projects with institutes from abroad .
in partnership with the national department of water affairs and forestry , the agricultural research council , agriculture western cape and other conservation specialists we have launched a research project to monitor the water consumption of the foremost important western cape export products - table grapes , wine grapes , pears and plums .
madam chairperson , we would like to record our objection in respect of money allocated to the standing committees which is not necessarily being expended by the chairpersons of those committees in line with the normal procedures of government .
it is within the scope of the provincial commission of inquiry into the cape peninsula fires to make recommendations , not only on disaster management , but also on land management practices which can be implemented to avert similar tragedies in the future .
just like president mbeki , i am confident that there is the will to work together to ensure that these elections will be held in conditions of peace and peaceful political competition and that they are free and fair .
failure to comply with the provisions and what the minister proposes be done can constitute an offence - and section 35 deals with this - with a fine not exceeding r10 000 .
we refer here , mr speaker , to the problems raised in a document drafted by the anc , which has also been sent to the hon minister , analysing the problems and saying what solutions should be used .
argument in the constitutional court only last week had senior counsel arguing that the provincial government and the cape metropolitan council are insensitive and uncaring when it comes to the situation of people living in informal settlements .
mr speaker , after the cabinet had approved the amendment bill , it took the route of the speaker ; the speaker had to convene the standing committee , and the standing committee needed enough time to draft a well-considered amendment bill .
the hon minister would prefer to go to tokai to talk to a few ratepayers there who are concerned about street children possibly being accepted into the porter school under project chrysalis and that that would have certain implications for the neighbourhood .
indeed , the director-general of correctional services , known as , i think , the commissioner-general , had to go before the national parliamentary portfolio committee two or three weeks ago and say , " i am sorry , but this department is out of control .
while the hon minister blames others and complains , it is the leaders of the anc who have to go into the violence-ravaged areas and support the victims of violence and who have to help the loved ones of the departed to take their final steps to the grave with dignity .
any person or political party - be it the anc , the new np or the dp - that says that they can single-handedly contain crime in the province is confusing and misleading people .
that promise was fulfilled by his cabinet in november 1999 when they approved that this new registration process would come into being , and the provincial tender board was presented with a tender proposal for r5,5 million for the registration process , including id photos .
mr speaker , after careful consideration of the above i am satisfied that all the necessary criteria have been met and can therefore with confidence - i repeat , with confidence - recommend to the house that this bill be accepted .
madam chairperson , the national department of education has allocated r150 million from the education budget to pay 100 teachers full salaries and benefits for two to three years - not to teach , but to organise trade unions !
if the hon member genuinely wants an answer to those questions , the courtesy would have been to have prior notice rather than to conduct what amounts to a filibuster just to delay the process of this law .
madam chairperson , can i assume that central to the hon minister of education applying her mind , and coming here today and voting in support of this bill , has to be the question of whether teachers were involved and taken out of schools .
i want to know if the hon ministers are supposed automatically to obtain the hansard report and answer those questions , and will this be official , or can questions only be answered if the hon members put them in writing ?
this commitment will only be noticed if , for instance , schools like uxolo high school , matthew goniwe high school and mayibuye high school do not have to resort to using laboratories as classrooms , because there is no laboratory equipment for teaching science .
mr speaker , i want to say to the hon premier and to the hon minister of community safety that we must get out of the gear in which every year money is hurriedly made available at festival time for a stop crime campaign .
it was really frightening to read two headlines in a single newspaper yesterday , and i quote from p 2 of die burger , " meisie ( 17 ) sterf in bendeskietery " , and , " bende-kruisvuur eis twee lewens " .
mr speaker , it is a pity that the hon member mr a j williams has chosen to repeat the words " adapt or die " - which are clearly a figurative expression - to create a crisis in the agricultural community .
the anc is responding to local concerns by flexing its authoritarian muscle , imposing its will on the people , threatening anyone who challenges them and warning representatives of other political parties , including me , to stay out of crossroads .
firstly , it is a matter of grave concern to me that our law allows educators to serve simultaneously as local councillors , and thus earn two state salaries , usually failing to do either job properly .
let us remind hon members again that the majority of the people of south africa have spoken in three different elections and said that they have confidence in the anc to transform our country and build a better life .
it is the unequal allocation of police resources , the lack of tender opportunities for coloured and african business , its abuse and ill-treatment of farm workers , and an unrepresentative civil service based on " boetie-boetie " lines that continue to divide communities in the western cape .
i was witness to the fact that throughout the festive season , when our roads were busy and we were all on holiday , they were at their posts making sure that the accident and death toll on our roads was kept to a minimum .
why does the hon premier not tell us about the figures which show that this government has failed to ensure that the receipt of child support grants by the poorest children in our communities has been adequately sold to our poor communities ?
the committee notes with concern that own revenue generated from the casino revenue has been utilised to partly finance the capital cost of installing cameras in the vicinity of the casino in the absence of consideration of other priority areas .
mr speaker , i also want to join other members of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling in thanking the officials that have assisted us , in particular the officials from the department of finance , messrs ismay and mr langenhoven , and others .
" i always tried to correct her by pointing out that it should not be from the devil himself ; it should be from the devil herself " .
although one would caution that the reports should be as correct as possible , if there happen to be some faults or mistakes , the report with the latest recommendations or changes will be the one to stand before the house .
madam chairperson , as a follow-up question , is the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism saying that there were no kmos or that he is not aware of what the kmos are and he will give them to me later ?
] we are supposed to be in our constituencies trying to solve the problems right now , but we have been called to a sitting of the house to deliberate on the lives of people that are suffering .
mr speaker , on a point of order : the hon minister said he was not sure who gave the instruction and then he went ahead and told the house that we as the anc had given the order .
they seem to be benefiting from the provincial government dragging its feet , from protracted and endless negotiations , and from a lack of political will to bring peace , because for as long as the crisis continues , they have more than they want .
the only thing is that if we do not resolve this problem , anarchy in this country will spill over from one area to another because there is no real desire among those people to negotiate in a decent fashion .
obviously we have two others , one already in operation in durban which has really established itself as an african convention centre destination and there is the one to be completed in sandton , which will focus more on johannesburg-related business .
indeed , as the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism has indicated , research has shown that a convention centre could permanently increase the gross geographical product of the cape metro by some r1 billion per year , and it would create jobs .
when the anc questioned how a shareholding could be authorised without looking at the shareholders ' agreements , the new np and the dp members , together with the chairperson , moved against us and said they were two completely separate issues .
] the question that arises is : is the entire performance which we have seen from the anc side not just some attempt at politicking and the bill just a convenient boat which passed at the time ?
madam chairperson , i think the first amendment is in order , in other words a new subsection ( 2 ) , but i do not agree with the second amendment because , quite frankly , it would go along anyway .
for the purposes of the provincial government making a financial contribution in terms of the shareholders agreement to convenco or purchasing equity in convenco in terms of the shareholders agreement , the provincial minister of finance may only appropriate funds that have been authorised -
the standing committee on governmental affairs and community safety , having considered the subject of the western cape determination of types of municipalities bill [ b10-2000 ] , referred to it , begs to report the bill without amendment .
the provincial parliament is proposing a menu in the legislation under consideration , and in terms of section 12 of the aforementioned act , i can exercise my powers and determine the type of municipality for categories a , b or c , or in the 30 different municipalities .
mr speaker , the national constitution provides for three categories of municipalities , and one should take into consideration the last section of the preamble of the western cape determination of types of municipalities bill which reads , and i quote :
noes-16 : brown l ; byneveldt s e ; dugmore c m ; essop t ; fransman m l ; gabru y ; mckenzie p c ; mqulwana k a ; ozinsky m ; phenduka n c ; phike l ; ramatlakane l ; rasool e ; stali z c ; vantura m g ; and williams r .
i also refer to prof john dugard 's human rights and the south african legal order , which is the definitive work on the south african legal order , published in 1978 , where he draws the same conclusions about the racial bias of the judiciary .
no less a person than the national minister of justice and constitutional development last year apologised to judges goldstone and kriegler , on the instructions of president mbeki - and i respect him for that - when he questioned their integrity .
they can take mr rajbansi and dip him in ; they can take mr gogotsha and dip him in ; and they can take ms madikizela-mandela and dip her in , and they will all come out " good and clean and fresh , tra-la-la " .
our decision is based on the fact that the assessor 's report states that the property which mrs kosana wants to purchase is located in a poor area surrounded by squatter camps and is not a good security for mortgage purposes .
mr speaker , the new np of the western cape commits itself to effective coordination and planning in cooperation with the central government with a view to the expansion and promotion of entrepreneurship among the black , brown and white people who need this in those communities .
municipal rates are rising because local government tries to do everything from small business development to election administration , instead of focusing on the core issues such as the delivery of water and refuse removal which are basic services .
municipalities - and it is not only confined to the rest of the country , the figures are available for us in the western cape - owe a total of r12,4 billion amounting to about five months ' worth of rates and service charges to creditors .
it is therefore not surprising that with such inefficiencies , and a virtual failure of the much publicised masakhane campaign of the anc , there are now attempts to compensate an unwillingness to pay rates by overtaxing law-abiding south africans .
they are right to be concerned about possible rate hikes because for most people their family home is their single biggest investment , and substantial increases in the rates they pay can make the difference between owning and losing their homes .
if any city fails to deal with poverty , then it will affect the people of that city , and that includes the rich as well as the poor .
however , in my opinion this is not possible with the strategy of opposition for the sake of opposition , in terms of which we simply want to keep on opposing , do not want to cooperate and do not want to ensure that we build a national identity .
the committee wishes to express its appreciation for the transparency in this chapter and recommends that before any provincial department enters into an agreement which contains possible liability factors , the minister of finance and the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling be consulted .
if any hon member gets up and says that another hon member is misleading the house and it is found on evidence that the accusation is wrongful , then that hon member will be in trouble .
what we saw in an earlier debate with regard to allegations of inefficiency , mismanagement and corruption against the south peninsula municipality was the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs sitting on the task team and the dp was absolutely mute .
it is said that if one cannot take the heat in the kitchen then one must get out , and this despicable behaviour by hon members of the opposition will be judged by the public as being exactly what it is - despicable .
mr speaker , they were correct when they said the board unanimously accepted that i had no conflict of interest and after i had presented information that was not necessary - as confirmed by the attorneys .
mr speaker , i also wish to refer to the reaction to intelligence information , hoping that the relevant minister will not hesitate to use it or that he will not take the information with a pinch of salt , or a bucket of salt .
] accordingly , mr speaker , i call upon the hon minister of community safety , if it is within his power or jurisdiction , to hold discussions with pagad and report the results of such a discussion to the national ministers .
i call upon the hon member mr byneveldt , when we criticise the coalition government about the way they implement affirmative action , to encourage the implementation of affirmative action in all spheres and at all levels with the same zeal and the same mercilessness .
( 3 ) further congratulates the national minister on implementing a strategy on subsistence fishing to ensure that poor fishing people can access permits despite the strategy of the da to keep the industry bogged down in court cases .
finally , mr speaker , i want to say to the hon member mr dugmore that now that he is so concerned about the situation of farm workers in the south cape , he should rather speak to the president about the drought in the southern cape ...
if there are unreasonable demands , such as wanting to see the independent electoral commission and wanting all the ministers to appear before the committee , i cannot but concur that the chairperson acted correctly .
i am pleased to report to the house as follows : this is the second year running that we have proved that we can contain expenditure pressures , as hon members will notice from the figures presented to them .
in my heart i thought to myself , he is upset with me for approving a shopping centre in goodwood , but what about the approval by the da of a casino of r1,4 billion that is robbing our children for generations , ...
they should sit and think for a moment , and put themselves in the shoes of those who are unemployed and starving - a group which is increasing month after month - and ask them to personally craft labour legislation .
mr speaker , i thank you for the opportunity to participate in this debate , particularly after the hon premier revealed such wonderful vision and spelled out goals for this province , the leading province at the southern point of africa , the day before yesterday .
for many inhabitants of our province , particularly those in knysna , george , mossel bay , oudtshoorn , uniondale , haarlem , prince albert and leeu-gamka , this torture has now come to an end. by the way , those people in leeu-gamka who were compensated were unemployed .
the hon minister of community safety spent r1 million on investigations into the killings during the taxi violence , whilst taxpayers ' money is being used by senior officials who are mainly white and who have no interest at all in our black communities .
mr speaker , i want to congratulate the hon premier and the cabinet on the manner in which the da has governed the western cape and i also want to congratulate them on their local election victory , especially on having taken control of the unicity .
if we look at the other municipalities - a few municipalities have taken shape , of which approximately five are controlled by the anc - we find that things are going badly in those municipalities in the western cape after two months of new government .
i am talking about the children from the townships , the cape flats and the farms who face a world economic order that they cannot begin to comprehend , but which requires them to become knowledge workers in a knowledge economy .
i say that it is a disgrace that such a statement should be made by someone who acts so self-righteously , while he is actually racism 's guardian , and that it is in the newspapers for the whole world to see .
i will be interested to hear the hon members mr ozinsky 's or ms essop 's or anyone else 's analysis of how these anc stalwarts are serving the desperately poor victims of crime in the charge office by watching the bold and the beautiful .
because we are for the poor , we have opted to keep our services going at all costs and we understand fully that any overexpenditure in this financial year must be accommodated in the business plans for the coming financial year .
with the exception of groote schuur hospital , where the salary bill has been overspent , the overexpenditure is located mainly in stores and livestock , which is to be expected as a health service , by its very nature , and is always a great consumer of perishables .
regarding this debate , i want to indicate that the hon minister of education , who is not here , made lots of statements , and i can link that with what i have to say about the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation .
what i could do is conclude , based on the case that we have made on this side of the house , that our case rests regarding our support for the hon premier and his address .
madam speaker , regarding their extreme criticism of me , suggesting that i am incompetent , i actually appreciate that , because i now know exactly where i stand with some hon members on that side of the house .
the risks inherent in wage creep , the lack of an effective retrenchment tool and improperly trained or utilised staff necessitate an overall human resource mtef plan , rather than attempting to define maximum number of employees based on purely financial calculations .
( c ) the fact that we continue to be constrained by the absence of national policy , as there is still no clarity on the so-called allowed list and because we cannot raise provincial taxes without national approval .
the thinking of the hon minister of finance and development planning , rather to tackle joint projects between the private sector and the province , and ensure stable annual revenue on a planned basis , is very strongly supported by the new np .
i would venture to suggest that they should support me in calling for the resignation of the national minister for the public service and administration because of her incompetence in not spending money for the poorest of the poor on her watch .
let us go forward into the new year , and i mean all of us in the house , resolute to make a difference , disciplined to deliver , fired up to help , excited about the many opportunities out there and dedicated to serve .
the key deliverables that were addressed during the 1999-2000 financial year are as follows : the establishment of departmental and provincial structures - these are the departmental focal units ; the development of supporting documents ; fostering of networking links ; communication and awareness-raising programmes ; and gender and disability workshops with the pawc staff .
madam chairperson , the hon minister of finance and development planning started his budget speech with a reminder of the six " clusters " for budget policies and the nine strategic goals of the provincial government which were approved in july last year .
as chairperson of the standing committee on health , social services , office of the premier and corporate services , responsible for the disabled , youth , gender issues and transformation , strategic goal no 4 and its progress and implementation concerned me especially in scof .
the present hon minister in the office of the premier is on record as saying that it is true that this government has not been able to establish structures in connection with the concerns of the youth .
if we want to improve the quality of services rendered by members of this house , be it in the execution of their constituency duties or their parliamentary obligations , this parliament will have to empower and capacitate the members to do so .
we do not know whether that official letterhead was being used on behalf of the dp half of the hon minister or his other half - and i do not know if it is his better half - which is when he represents the government here .
we have had three , four or even five debates on this item , but it is clear that the hon member mr mckenzie has not listened to his own leader when it comes to placing interpellations on the question paper .
whether the western cape provincial tender board has submitted annual reports since 1994 ; if not ; why not ; if so ; ( a ) when were these reports submitted and to whom and ( b ) whether these reports were tabled in the provincial parliament ?
( 3 ) my department believes that the revision of the grotto bay emp and its implementation is currently receiving attention by all parties concerned and therefore no court action is contemplated in terms of environmental legislation at this stage .
i was to address the increasing occurrence of crime , and particularly gang violence , in the area and i particularly wanted to repeat my and the saps 's previous appeals that the communities should come forward and support the saps in their difficult task of curbing crime .
due to the proactive preventative steps taken by the provincial his management committee these additional costs that can be quantified are limited to only the costs pertaining to the updating of the current chs ( cape hospital system ) for y2k compliance : r194 000 .
i also believe that if one talks about the knowledge economy of the 21st century , which is one of the policy objectives of this government , then this is moving in the right direction as far as that slumbering economic giant , as i call it , is concerned .
in response to the hon member mr byneveldt 's comment that we do not do what we are meant to do , i give him the insurance that we , in fact , do much more than what we are meant to do .
in order to minimalise further legal costs , the parties met on 31 january 2000 and agreement was reached between the applicants and the council 's lawyers that the west coast district council would per agreement temporarily restore their entry under the following conditions :
mr speaker , is the hon minister aware that it never came before the standing committee and that in the negotiations between him and the chairperson of that committee the committee was entirely left out of the interaction in relation to that submission .
my question is this : what can the provincial government do within its powers to ensure the safety of our commuters and to prevent a law-abiding company like golden arrow from , as was reported in this morning 's newspaper , having to close its doors .
in fact , the hon minister of community safety here has just shown what can be done , whereas the former minister of community safety made a big fuss about not having the necessary powers to deal with it .
during that time , before the five month period was up , i was made aware of the fact that the central government was going to introduce the bill in parliament and it would become an act , as it did , on 3 february 2000 .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon minister of health whether he is aware of the crisis in this regard at the dr abdurahman day hospital in athlone , and whether he has any hope for that hospital in the near future .
whether any plans are in place to transport underprivileged people living in the tygerberg area who have to travel more than 60 km to sports fields catering for their needs ; if not , why not ; if so , what are the details of the plans ?
mr speaker , i want to know from the hon minister of local government and development planning whether he regards the illegal trade in diamonds as being worse or lighter than watching pornography in one 's office during office hours .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon minister of local government and development planning , if the process is going to be done in-house , does it mean that the consultants who were originally employed and paid will not be used for that process ?
we have great concern over what has happened , but whilst we may express our concern , i do not believe that we should take to the streets and cause people 's emotions to flare up as the anc has done in these circumstances .
the issue of hiv / aids is of such major concern to this province that i have appointed a deputy director-general : special projects to focus on our hiv / aids strategy and to take charge of the related battle against tb .
the only quick-fix that we have so far seen in the area has been the erection of some poles around the spillage area with air-fresheners hanging from ropes on these poles ; this is not acceptable , mr speaker .
the hon minister should suggest to local governments and the local municipalities that are involved in supplying sewage to this area that they give each and every household a brick to put in their cisterns .
there have already been four follow-up questions - two by the hon member mr ramatlakane , one by the hon member ms essop and the fourth one by the hon member mr marais , and the speaker has to look at both sides of the house .
my question is twofold : what is the hon premier 's feeling about the delay and the capacity at the department of home affairs to process these permits and , secondly , what is he going to do about it for the people of the western cape ?
in las vegas it is dealt with in a manner which purely scratches the surface in so far as public awareness is concerned , and this in a state with the unenviable record of reportedly having the highest statistics in the usa for suicide and for child pregnancy .
the budget allocation is r103,45 million , of which 27 % is allocated to salaries , and 27 % to a combination of the state information technology agency - better known as sita - contractors and software licences , which leaves 44 % , or r45 million , to critical projects of the various departments .
the context , obviously , is that we cannot interfere in the enshrined independence of the tender board and its processes , but we , as this house , must note , without fear or favour , that the tender board went against the recommendations of the department .
on the issue of gambling , i am particularly pleased that the hon minister has mentioned the question of problem gambling and the effects that this can have on our society - particularly a society that is characterised by poverty and deprivation .
i might say that people have come to me - i will say this outside the house too - criticising the hon member mr gabru because he was attempting to protect other interested parties in the metropolitan casino licence ...
i repeat what i said , that people have come to me to accuse - hansard will confirm it , but i will repeat it - the hon member mr gabru of being involved with other , or one other licence person .
the part-time force component also cannot be relied on to any extent , due to a lack of funds , the absence of a national service feeder system , a lack of adequate training at all levels and the break-up of many of the traditional units and formations .
truancy in the area is a consequence of a number of factors that include the inability of parents to compel their children to attend school and to parents who fail to take sufficient interest in the child 's education .
madam chairperson , i would like to repeat , with the commitment and the determination of the hon minister and his department , the baby nicknamed " markie " will soon develop into a preventative giant and develop young adults as assets to society .
we shall do this by supporting the sports federations in the province , assisting local authorities to upgrade and build new sports facilities and encouraging the development of outstanding athletes at provincial and national level to improve representivity .
some of the benefits are a knowledge and skills transfer to local trainers and to create participation , because of the attraction of the trainer ; one could for instance get beckham to come and visit as a soccer trainer .
coach barnes is a man who has found his feet in sport ; an individual who has coached many teams , who has worked on big fields and has ensured that he developed other people in the process , but the attack is aimed at him .
if i visit a high school and find that there is no hiv / aids programme , i endeavour to ensure that an appropriate ngo visits that school without delay to run a basic information and training programme for the learners and staff .
mr chairperson , the area that will receive the biggest boost in the year ahead is the maintenance programme , because this is where we have perhaps spent less than we should have in past years , but that past choice was inevitable .
i therefore find it gratifying that the western cape education department is now on a broader basis motivating schools to perform so that achievable targets can be set in order to be accorded recognition , and this is not confined solely to the schools at which pupils achieve a averages .
in a report that an aids-education ngo submitted to me they say that after a visit to a school they were shocked to the core at the could-not-care-less approach , lack of discipline and bad attitude displayed by those students .
in accordance with the intended shift of the bulk of the patient load from expensive tertiary academic hospitals to other hospitals , admissions to academic hospitals dropped by 24 % , while admissions to regional hospitals increased by nearly 24 % over the same period .
at present , patients in our academic hospitals requiring magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) are referred to the private sector at a cost of more than r1,2 million per year , excluding the costs of transport and nurse escorts .
he practically begged the standing committee to do something to stop the proposed cuts , because he was sure they could lead to the collapse of the western cape 's health system , something that actually happened in gauteng a few weeks later .
i am telling the hon leader of the opposition that that attitude is totally unfair , especially coming from someone who never took part , apart from standing up here for the public or whatever he was doing .
mr chairperson , i wish to salute the whole team , more especially ms petersen , dr terblanch - who is not present today - ms follentine , mr van der westhuizen , and in the last two or three years mr de grass .
i would like to ask the hon minister not only to keep us informed as to the progress of the case , but to support the comment made by the hon member ms brown in the standing committee yesterday .
i am aware that the department is doing wonderful work in eradicating those practices that can have a negative effect towards the already poor and marginalised communities , that can lead to further degradation and affect the self-esteem of the poor .
that is why i am so pleased to see that this department is moving into monitoring and evaluation and more of a performance orientation , rather than simply giving money to the poor , to health care and so on .
on tuesday , 18 november 1998 , in response to a question from you , madam chairperson , about her programme on gender equality , this is her programme , and i quote from hansard : western cape , 18 november 1998 , interpellations , questions and replies , vol 9 , col 652 :
however , she " saved " r1 million from her own budget in the 1999-2000 financial year because , according to the official who presented this to us in the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling , the hon minister did not have a business plan .
i went into the internet website today - this is the page of the internet website - and , lo and behold , not even the name of the hon minister in the office of the premier features on the internet website of the office of the premier !
madam chairperson , this is a difficult debate to get into , because so much of what is said goes back to a period in which we allowed ourselves to think of a better alternative to the welfare systems which existed .
in relation to the whole issue of the reconceptualisation of welfare , i want to say that we may have averted a welfare crisis now , but such a welfare crisis will hit us at some point , when our old models are not going to be good enough .
in accordance with the provisions of the western cape provincial housing act , 1997 ( act 12 of 1997 ) , i have already laid down guidelines in terms of which land that is suitable for housing can be transferred to local authorities in line with the national housing programmes .
at provincial level we are looking at a mechanism to address the problems faced by farm workers who , once they retire , can no longer remain on the farms and are forced to migrate to the nearest town .
i am pleased to advise that the national department of housing is busy with amendments to the existing policy , which will hopefully grant such individuals access to subsidies in order to build a top structure on the property they have acquired .
we in the dp believe that when it comes to low-cost housing development for the poor , communities should not be encouraged to choose the best available , but rather what is affordable and sustainable , but still enhances quality of life and retains a market value .
mr chairperson , it is very sad to hear the people of the western cape talk about the problems they are experiencing in housing developments put there by developers who have no feelings at all for the poor people of this province .
hon members will agree with me that it is petty politics to accuse me today of not putting provincial legislation on the table , considering the fact that there is national legislation , the old civil protection act of 1977 , that first has to be replaced .
i also , unusually , want to thank the hon minister , because , while we disagree on many things , when he is around we do not have many dull moments , and there are areas where he has done some very good work .
numerous landowners are in the dark as to their rights on their own land , and each time they enquire from their local planning officer the answer is , " just wait for the new structure plan " , " just wait for the new demarcation .
we are eagerly awaiting the green paper of the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism , but i think that he needs to look very carefully at what goes into that green paper , so that we do not cut off key stakeholders in this process from participation .
hon members will have ample opportunity to deal with this matter through the green paper , but i will fight strongly - read my lips - to see that not one person from the provincial development council is fired .
i am saying that r806 000 is a start , but we should not put ourselves in a position where we do good educational work , but do not follow it up by actually controlling pollution and monitoring what happens on the ground .
additionally , i am touched by the sincere efforts of the hon premier and all hon ministers , and their immediate response , in order to underpin the seriousness of hiv / aids , of looking at ways and projects to help to beat this scourge .
the hon member mr ozinsky has already made three speeches and the hon member ms essop two , and if hon members were to ask me today what areas they represent in the western cape , i am sorry , but i should not be able to reply .
first of all i would like to thank the hon member mr a j williams for chairing the standing committee dealing with environmental and cultural affairs and for being so supportive of me in my maiden year in the provincial parliament , so to speak .
the standing committee on governmental affairs and community safety , having considered the subject of the municipal ordinance , 1974 amendment bill [ b 4-2000 ] , referred to it , begs to report the bill without amendment .
that the house notes that prisoners have refused to appear in the mitchells plain magistrate 's court as a result of disgusting treatment in site b at the khayelitsha police station where a body and the prisoners had to share a cell for three days .
are hon members aware that apart from heavy vehicles - " triple interlinks " , " double interlinks " , long trailers and so on - the increase that we are now announcing is in certain instances less than a single tank of petrol for a medium-sized car ?
madam chairperson , it is also clear to us that an institution responsible for the promotion of investments in our province must not or cannot only attend to foreign investments but must also , indeed , deal with inland investment .
madam chairperson , there is also an increasing need to give structure to the essential intellectual dialogue that is constantly taking place between the private and public sectors over the years , the role of regional governments and economic development has become increasingly important worldwide .
i call upon the anc to clean up their act where they have public representatives who exploit citizens of the province for profit , and where these public representatives have links with this sort of illegal and immoral trade .
key on the agenda were issues that dealt primarily with disempowerment and the growing divide between north and south in relation to knowledge economies - the information divide , the problems of access and connectivity and , in fact , the very definition of " knowledge society " .
while we can talk about growing the economy , we know - it is internationally accepted - that smmes and , in particular , the informal trading sector represent , in fact , a very large growth sector in any economy , but the department has no policies about that .
madam chairperson , we have reached the point at which it is necessary for this government - and from my side certainly - to tell the anc in this province that by way of that race card they have mounted a tiger .
madam chairperson , the food and agricultural organisation of the usa is of the opinion that if we take into account the success of certain asiatic and african countries , governments should spend at least 25 % of their budgets on agriculture and agricultural development programmes .
this fact , as well as the high-risk environment of farming , is clear from last year 's drought in the southern cape - and we have not received an answer to this problem yet ; hail damage in the caledon district ; and the recent floods in the karoo .
we are looking forward in particular to the finalising of the five bills which the hon minister will submit to the standing committee , namely the agricultural development service act , the products act , the meat licences act , the animal diseases act and the land reform act .
these are extreme criminal actions that violate the constitutional right of each and every person to exercise free choice in regard to the mode of transport which he or she chooses to reach his or her destination .
the anc makes a further call , to all peace-loving people in this province to remain calm at all times , and also calls on taxi operators to pursue a negotiated settlement while there is still time to do so .
the amendment bill provides that where a situation of violence , unrest and conflict arises , the hon minister declares the area a " declared area " by way of a notice in the provincial gazette , as well as in newspapers available in the relevant areas .
we do not have the problem that we have to see to it that we say the right thing to prevent the election coffers and the party coffers from being shaken if we perhaps speak in a confused way or oppose certain interests .
mr speaker , crime is running rampant , the people of the western cape are living in fear , people are unsure about what the future holds , and are asking many questions about whether the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation in the western cape can really contain crime and violence .
mr speaker , the objective of the western cape finance bill [ b 1-2000 ] is to authorise expenditure incurred in the 1998-99 and the 1999-2000 financial years in respect of support given to the independent electoral commission which had not initially been budgeted for .
that hon member also received a copy and if he asks me whether it is credible , then that means to me that he does not believe the contents of those letters which bear the stamp of the office of the president .
although anyone would recognise the prerogative of the cabinet in handling the matter , i think it is important to bear in mind that we as a house have a specific function to perform - the cabinet governs and the members have an oversight function .
however , the government did not go that route , because the very next day - and this was two days after the request had come from the national government - the cabinet had already decided to spend r7,6 million on the volunteers .

obviously , if one wants the people to be cooperative , one will do one 's arithmetic and say that if we have paid the people r1 000 per month and spent r18 000 , then we must have employed 18 people in social services .
i have requested them to supply me with detailed information on how the money was spent in terms of how the wages were paid , which i will gladly give to the hon member mr ozinsky and the house if necessary .
madam chairperson , as a follow-up to that , given the conversation that we are having now across the floor , would the hon minister have asked that question this morning and would it have influenced her decision to vote for this bill today ?
madam chairperson , the information provided to me by the department is that several members of my department took part in this exercise - john cloete , celeste williams , zulela ludidi , moenieba abrahams , janie boshoff , zubeida bardien , vanessa paulse and keith stevens .
my further question would be : merely on the basis of the criteria used , the one vote as against the other - the one division , half , as against the other - was there any impact of responsibilities that had a greater priority in relation to others ?
nobody asked permission to use this opportunity to put a motion and , as there are none on the order paper today , i presumed that nobody wanted to use the opportunity to do so .
the anc want to see continued development , infrastructural development , but also a conscious shift of focus for development and investment to areas like mitchells plain , khayelitsha and blue downs , so that they cease to be dormitory townships for workers and dumping grounds for the unemployed .
if the hon leader of the opposition is really serious he would join my colleague - and i invite him to do so - and go to the national minister of housing and argue for more funds for this province .
i want measurable progress and i want all the people that need relief and assistance to feel the difference or at least know that there is an agency that urgently wants to make that difference in collaboration with them .
[ mr speaker , let me take this opportunity to wish the hon premier of the province and all its mpps a happy and prosperous new year , and good luck with the work they have been elected to do .
after all , it is the hon premier who speaks about " integrity in political leadership " , and " leaders they can believe in " , and who says , " it is our duty to provide the people of the western cape with such leadership " .
whatever the case may be , given the fact that in his address the hon premier relied particularly heavily on the issue of integrity , it is important particularly when he delivers speeches , to convey integrity and not mislead us .
i tried to introduce a motion in the house that the standing committee on governmental affairs and community safety should discuss this matter , but because of the defensiveness of the hon minister of housing people obviously objected to the motion .
what is shocking , and i am not sure whether the hon premier is aware of this , is that legal fees of r1 494 was the biggest component of the selling price - even more than the arrears owing to the council .
local anc representatives there are picking up more than the hon leader of the opposition on the other side of the house is picking up , because they know that there is growing resistance to their authoritarianism , and they are indeed very worried about it .
in some instances , mr speaker , i understand that senior anc politicians phoned to put pressure on officials to give educators time off , a direct contradiction of this government 's policy and , frankly , nothing short of scandalous .
last year i came upon an extraordinary case of an anc councillor who was also an educator , but he was put on long leave from teaching for stress by his doctor , because he could not cope with the demands of both jobs .
it is about being creative and not trying to take short cuts in order to make political mileage out of it , such as when an hon member over there screams that it is the lotto money or the national government 's fault .
if she were here , i would tell her that i have worked in crossroads in different capacities - as much as she has ; i know crossroads as well as she does ; i have lived in crossroads - i doubt if she has .
i wish the hon members on the other side would make an attempt to read the regular article of mr kaizer nyatsumba in the cape argus of last wednesday , 31 january 2001 , in which he says , and i quote :
it may be instructive , after hearing the hon member ms rossouw twisting the facts and confusing fiction with fact , to recall the facts of this incident as reported in the cape argus of 2 february 2001 .
in spite of all our efforts , in spite of saturation coverage in the mass media to impress the urgency of the situation on young people , this young man did not even consider using condoms until a fortnight ago .
of the r263 million allocated in the second adjustments appropriation , r182 million comes from the national government and the rest , approximately r80 million , has been obtained from increased self-generated revenue , of which r60 million comes from the 1999-2000 financial year and the r20 million from the current financial year .
now that the province suddenly has an income from casino licences , instead of drawing up a clear priority list based on what is happening on the ground , the casino money is in effect being paid back to the casino by deciding to put cameras directly outside the casino .
mr speaker , if anyone has to take blame - and i use the word " blame " very loosely - in this matter , i am prepared to take the blame for the r10 million not having been spent .
if we receive something like r100 million per year in tax from the grandwest casino , coupled with the fact that sun international put r13 million into it , i believe we took the correct action in putting in r5,4 million .
when it comes to key measurable objectives of old-age homes and the other institutions that i have mentioned , hon members will accept and agree that the service provided by the department is of a service nature and not of a financial nature .
in regard to this ongoing policy i wish to ask the hon minister , if he decides to close the taxi ranks in khayelitsha today , to do his best to prevent the violence from breaking out tomorrow in langa , guguletu or lwandle .
this house consolidated to underwrite that act and we call on the hon minister to give reasons why the act has not been implemented , and ask that the powers that have been given to him be implemented immediately .
mr speaker , the most tragic aspect of all is that in pursuing their narrow economic interests , the warring factions - and especially the taxis - are in the process of destroying the economy of the western cape .
( 2 ) acknowledges his contribution to human rights in the days of apartheid , his role during negotiations , his fingerprints in our constitution and that of namibia , and his commitment to the transformation of law and the judiciary in south africa ; and
however , we expected that any legislation and other instruments - such as the shareholders ' agreement , which is supposed to bring to fruition this convention centre - would have been dealt with with more circumspection than has been the case in the way it has been dealt with here .
the sooner the convention centre is completed , the better for cape town which is rapidly climbing up the rankings of top international conference cities , having moved from the 44th to the 28th most popular convention destination in the world .
we must admit - and it came out in some of the design presentations as well - that the cape malay community , in particular , is a community which in its culture thrives on and celebrates weddings and other public social functions .
i find it very strange that in our convention centre company the city of cape town , in the person of mr saleem mowzer , who at last notice was not in the dp but in the anc , is a very enthusiastic supporter of this convention centre .
while we would agree that affirmative action principles are also the policy of this side of the house , it is not always possible to find a suitable candidate who fits the criteria and qualifies under affirmative action .
register of property for transfer of movable assets from the department of environmental and cultural affairs and sport to the western cape nature conservation board ( wcncb ) [ copy of document available at room 4-96 ]
the unauthorised expenditure amounting to r81 085 was considered and the committee , noting the circumstances which gave rise to the excess expenditure , recommends that the unauthorised expenditure of r81 085 be referred to the provincial parliament for authorisation .
( 2 ) further noting that despite the fact that a new np councillor has appeared before the atlantis regional court facing charges of corruption and fraud in excess of r1 million , he remains a member of the cape metropolitan council ; and
( 2 ) further noting that the dp in general and the minister of economic affairs and tourism in particular consistently refused to participate in the debate on the alleged corruption involved in granting the metropolitan casino licence ;
what the hon minister is trying to do - and he should just do it - is to say , " oh , there the new np can win , and there we shall lose ; and where we have influence we shall introduce our executive mayors .
next , mr speaker , i want to refer to the speech by the hon member mr n m isaacs , and thank him for the input he made , the ideas he expressed and the support he gave us .
therefore , if we have a substantial difference of opinion with a judge or the judiciary as a whole , we will not hesitate to raise it ; not as an end in itself , but to strengthen the judiciary and its legitimacy and credibility .
when their parties were in a position of influence - and , in fact , when the np was governing - it was only shortly before the 1994 elections that the qualities of mr justice mahomed were recognised and he was appointed as a judge .
gave vent to their emotions regarding the judgment in the boesak case , that was informed by , for instance , the judgment in the matter where mr steyn , who had been convicted of culpable homicide for the killing of baby angelina zwane , was given a suspended sentence .
not abe ; you know what is awaiting you , and it will be the judge 's fault again when he finds that you , who have already apologised , must apologise - then it will be the judge 's fault again .
they were desperate to get mr kriel like they got the hon member mr mckenzie , because they know they just have to dip them into the bucket of disinfectant and they will come out smelling " good and clean and fresh " .
small and medium black enterprises that could succeed on their own if they were given the opportunity of finance , and would be extremely successful as vibrant black businesses , cannot do so and form joint ventures with white companies .
the new np takes cognisance of the fact that the positive growth of this sector is being restricted by inadequate access to financial facilities and believes that there is no reason even to debate the need to stimulate this sector .
one of the main items that the bill deals with is to make absolutely sure that there is no ambiguity whatsoever that the money coming to the province is not vat included and that there is no vat payable on it .
] however , i wish to inform them that , as it is 17 : 15 , we will immediately move on to the next matter of public importance printed on the order paper in the name of the hon member mr a j williams .
that the house expresses its deepest sympathy with all families of the victims of the recent spate of child murders in the province and commends the saps for their efforts thus far to apprehend the perpetrators of these horrific crimes .
( 6 ) requests that more meaningful and effective support be given to neighbourhood watches , available resources be redistributed to areas where it is needed most , and fully equipped trauma rooms be established at all police stations , in order to combat the crime wave .
mr speaker , from the outset we predicted that the western cape gambling and racing law would be amended often , but i would never have dreamt that we would be amending the bill so often within such a short space of time .
( 2 ) condemns the manner in which the new np-controlled south peninsula municipality has attempted to cover up and prevent further investigation and debate on this matter of importance to the citizens and ratepayers in the executive committee and council of the spm .
the hon minister of community safety is a lawyer , but not once did he think that the companies act applied to convenco and that a declaration of interests had to be made right at the outset when they became a company .
if so , he should apologise to this house - as he has done before on unrelated issues - set the record straight , and take the necessary measures to ensure that the conflict of interests does not actually happen .
mr speaker , the cabinet controlled my appointment as a director of convenco , and in view of my full disclosures on 9 october 1998 , the cabinet therefore had full knowledge of my so-called interests and there was therefore no ...
it is that in this country the majority of people - the coloureds , africans and indians - were not represented in senior decision-making forums and senior positions in the workplace , and did not have access to land and finance and so on .
what i am saying is that if the hon minister is prepared to say that organised agriculture in the western cape must establish whether the person is one of their members and if so must suspend him , then we have found one another in this regard .
sir , the motion introduced here this afternoon is a sensitive one but unfortunately it means that a perception may develop that the anc is placing employers on farms on the altar and that the anc is treating all employers the same .
i would like to begin by confirming that the da is fully supportive of the overall objectives of the land reform ( labour tenants ) act which protects labour tenants against summary or unjust evictions and protects the rights of labour tenants , particularly regarding the ownership of land .
roll-over funds from the 1998-99 financial year amounted to r55,812 million , which includes r14,14 million for the rosendal care facility ; r1,81 million for the tourism board ; r1,255 million for the card and camera project ; r11,178 million for the various rdp projects ; and r5,144 million for fire damage and protective clothing .
section 160 ( 8 ) of the constitution and section 43 of the local government : municipal structures act very clearly state the legal requirement that a municipal council needs to be represented in substantially the same proportions as they represent in the council .
we know - it was mentioned by the hon leader of the opposition - that class inequalities are measured , amongst other things , by a gini coefficient and that south africa vies for the first place on the globe , and the western cape is in the first place in south africa .
when we take into account the fact that some 87 % of our entire budget is spent on the big three , it is indeed a miracle that this province has achieved the milestones which it has set itself in the economic sector of the budget .
instead of feeding the virus by voting for the same party election after election , as was the case in the old south africa , south african voters are realising that they can regain their lost health by voting for a clear alternative .
mr speaker , president thabo mbeki 's actions on foreign policy regarding zimbabwe , the absurd statements about aids and the arms scandal have caused the country irreparable damage and accelerated the process by which anc governance will turn south africa from a developing third world country into a banana republic .
it is also most encouraging to note that the provincial government has tried to do justice to these objectives in their application to the departmental budget allocations and planning towards attaining the nine provincial strategic outcomes which were formulated in 1999 .
the most horrible racist slogans such as " keep the anc out " are used , and horrible and disgusting radio advertisements insinuating that the anc are rapists , murderers and muggers - or , at the very least condone actions by such persons - are heard every day .
however , when we were confronted by a crisis in the western cape - it was not merely a dp , nnp , da or anc crisis , but a matter of councils with 50 : 50 representation , and that was a problem - we received his cooperation .
that the house , noting the commitment made by the premier last year to provide information concerning the circumstances under which the tender process for the chrysalis project was conducted , calls on the premier to disclose information with regard to the following matters :
sir , i also agree with the hon premier that we must continue to make the best of everything , as well as the fact that we can communicate more efficiently to let the people know what we are achieving here in the province .
undoubtedly our collective enemy remains poverty , inadequate housing , uneven and poor delivery of services , aids and the decline of our family values , much of which has been caused by a move away from a god-centred society and the creeping in of a humanist agenda .
can we in this province continue to be proud when the cape has become the gay capital of the world , the paedophile capital of the world , the rape capital of the world , and now we want to make it the gambling capital of the world ?
according to the noted historian argot tomby , western civilisation appears destined to follow the previous 19 out of 21 civilisations which have collapsed from within - not by conflict from without but because they abandoned their moral foundations .
it is our contention that if the office of the premier , together with the office of the director-general , are to interfere in the process of voter registration , the iec will not be able to exercise its functions without fear , favour or prejudice .
the mayors could not even represent their communities that day , even though it was their responsibility to ask questions , listen to the cabinet and place the cabinet under cross-examination before the media and the community of the southern cape .
i am convinced that , as far as the aforementioned aspects are concerned , the western cape government has made an outstanding success , since 2 june 1999 , with the funds at our disposal , of satisfying the outside world concerning economic growth and of addressing poverty , housing , education and health services .
mr speaker , the hon member mr isaacs and the hon minister of local government said in their speeches that i had invited rev sampson of the iec to this house and that i had dragged him and the iec into politics .
mr speaker , i find it very strange that when it suits the anc , they talk about black people ; and then they are africans , but when it does not suit them , then the hon members ms brown , mr mckenzie and mr gabru are coloured people .
when i spoke to the station commander he told me in desperation he had put the tv into the charge-office to prevent his officers going off to watch their favourite programmes at the local shebeen during working hours .
we cannot claim credit for what the police do , because they are a separate department , but just for the information of the house i must mention that urban terror in this province is down by 63,3 % at this point in time .
ms pandor says that the police are blundering by losing cases , but she neglects to say how many cases mr ngcuka , former anc politician , willie hofmeyr , former anc politician and percy sonn , whose affinity for the anc is well known , lose .
] i would have thought that if she was going to attack the police , which is a central government department , she would have been generous enough also to attack the department of justice which is making more mistakes at the moment with regard to losing cases .
tourists , potential foreign investors , and those sympathetic to south africa are unanimous in their view : get crime right and we will come , but if it goes on in this way there is no chance of us visiting or investing in south africa .
contrary to the current government practice of dither and drift and public relations hype , we need each of them to be vigorously implemented , rigorously prioritised and executed at provincial level without fear or favour .
madam speaker , may i , in the first place , say that i would like each of us , in a moment of introspection , to look at the past two days and analyse what we have , in fact , achieved for the people out there .
in this province , as elsewhere , there is a great need to accelerate economic growth if we are to arrest the further deterioration of vital infrastructure and enhance the quality of skills that are so necessary to a developing economy in a fiercely competitive world .
however , and i know my ministerial colleagues can provide statistical proof of this , the number of eastern cape children in our schools and the number of eastern cape hospital patients being attended to in this province are irrefutable evidence that the census statistics are an unreliable demographic indicator .
mr speaker , in all humility , i do not regard myself or my department as the repository of all wisdom for sound budgeting for this province , and that is why i have introduced a new process of consultation in regard to financial matters .
with reference to the motion of which the hon member mr durr has just given notice , there was a great deal of motivation in point ( 3 ) , and i wish to remind hon members to be careful of including motivation in motions .
mr speaker , in addition the new gfs format of the budget - and i am especially speaking on behalf of those who do not have much experience in this process - allows us to understand what can be expected to come out of each department in the province .
there i met a man from a disadvantaged community - not a white man - who until last year had provided employment to 40 people by operating a concession to exploit kelp on that part of the coast .
business people believe that if we want to improve the economy in this province , we should pay attention to the following issues : the outsourcing of non-core activities ; providing safe transport systems ; the cleaning up of the central business district ; and the prevalence of crime in the province .
i challenged her by saying that my door was always open and that if she wanted anything done , she should come and speak to me and tell me what she suggested should be in the budget .
while on that subject , may i just say that when it comes to the services for scof i agree entirely with the hon member mr strachan there who thinks that i have no sense of humour and that i am frivolous .
it is clear to me , therefore , that although we have as strategic goal number four " to contain the spread of hiv / aids and tuberculosis " , a lot needs to be done to assist all departments to honour this commitment .
she can be appointed as a minister , but if she does not work with the stakeholders dealing with the sector that she is supposed to champion , she is not going to be able to lead them .
i think the hon premier also has to find somebody who has the political will to work effectively for the empowerment of women , harness the energies of our youth and raise the quality of life of those who live with disabilities .
mr speaker , on a point of order : earlier in the debate the hon minister referred to a report of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling , in which the committee reported that no business plan had been presented to it .
a matter of concern to us is the question of the suggestion in the scof report that r770 000 of budgeted money should be reviewed , owing to some special technical problem which has to be resolved by the coalition caucuses .
the udm would like to say that the right route to follow , in our view , is to appoint staff who belong to parliament and can provide that service to standing committees and their chairpersons from within the parliamentary set-up .
now we all know that the committees have been clustered as a mechanism imposed by the numbers on that side of the house , because the coalition partners have only nine non-executive members between them .
the hon member can appreciate the fact that a committee studying gambling legislation , for example , may decide on its own that the members want to study gambling in las vegas and the speaker would then just have to pay for that .
i do not want to talk on behalf of the hon minister responsible for asset management , but a policy is being formulated with the aim of first doing away with industrial land that can be disposed of to the benefit of the province .
mr speaker , this hon member is a proponent of the megacity or unicity , and now , on the eve of the introduction of a unicity , he comes and fragments the concept of a unicity .
( 4 ) section 81 of the constitution of this province is aimed at creating an environment in which children are protected against abuse , neglect and maltreatment , and section 81 refers to the protection of the aged against maltreatment , neglect and abuse .
following the meeting , my department sent a comprehensive letter , dated 17 february 2000 , to the developer , the homeowners ' association and the west coast district council , clearly informing them of matters to be addressed in revising the environmental management plan and its implementation .
( 1 ) my predecessor delegated certain powers in terms of the disbursement of transfer payments to organisations to senior officials in the department of environmental and cultural affairs in terms of section 18 of the cultural affairs act , 1989 ( act 65 of 1989 ) .
in this regard i refer to section 48 ( 3 ) ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) of the south african police service act , act 68 of 1995 , in respect of reservists and his powers relating to reservists .
( 1 ) what are the details of the transformation 2000 plan , where did it originate and who was responsible for it ; ( 2 ) when will the plan be implemented and what are the financial implications to the province for the next three years ?
mr speaker , as a follow-up question , if i am allowed to do so , i would like to ask whether the hon minister of education is satisfied that in regard to all these closures , adequate transport arrangements have been made , particularly in regard to farm schools .
whether any schools under the jurisdiction of the wced were amalgamated since 1994 ; if not , why not ; if so , ( a ) which schools were amalgamated , ( b ) when were such schools amalgamated and ( c ) why were such schools amalgamated ?
( 2 ) whether he has drawn up a business plan to deal with the problems systematically ; if so , ( a ) what are the elements of the plan and ( b ) whether he will table a copy of the business plan ?
mr speaker , in the light of statements by his predecessor , the former minister of finance and development planning , for instance a statement on 15 september 1999 in his 100-day address , saying that , and i quote from hansard : western cape , vol 3 , p 446 :
i on numerous occasions raised with the former minister of finance and development planning - not only in the house , but also in the standing committee and in other meetings - that there were strong feelings that the act was unconstitutional .
then , one year down the line - in 1998 - they decided that they would implement the ten point plan and they would accede to the r2 million cut-off limit , but they excluded a number of key sectors in the province from the pdi procurement policy .
when the hon minister of community safety draws up a policy on his economic vision for the western cape he does not wait for regulations from the national government to give him guidance before he institutes a policy development process for the western cape .
the strategy of the wced for this week was to provide schools with the wced implementation plans for hiv / aids life skills and sexuality education in the curriculum , as well as ideas for learner and community participation in national schools hiv / aids week .
mr speaker , my last follow-up question is , did the hon premier fill in the form which states how to win with his contribution , and could he tell us how much money the provincial government has given to pmr over the last two , three years ?
if we as leaders cannot make such a commitment , we are failing the people at whose pleasure we serve , and i emphasise that it is " at whose pleasure we serve " .
mr speaker , i believe our province is actually beyond the phase of research sites , but in the interest of cooperation with the national department of health we will contribute data and render whatever assistance we can .
a negative variance to budget , an amount of r4,3 million , was brought about by the fact that the national government has yet to divide a particular amount of conditional grant funding between spheres of government , our portion of which had been earmarked in our annual budget for land development objectives .
] the point i want to make is i did not go to either of the two places to walk there ; i went there with the president to ask him for it to be declared a disaster area .
the second ground on which you denied the request for a secret ballot is that you have no separate power to suspend or change any rule in respect of procedures specifically provided for in the rules .
thus , repairs as a result of vandalism come out of two budget allocations , one major unscheduled maintenance , one minor unscheduled maintenance , and it is often very difficult to distinguish just what proportions of those budgets are directly related to vandalism-related damage .
( 2 ) the needs of about 110 schools were met through the major unscheduled maintenance programme , but much of the vandalism at schools goes unreported , as schools tend to use their minor unscheduled funds to repair minor damage .
after causing some consternation within the national finance ministry by budgeting for a deficit in the 1997-98 financial year , the western cape has over the past two financial years changed strategy and accepted the fiscal parameters laid down for it .
i would like to say to the hon minister of finance and development planning - and the national minister of finance - if we cannot raise our own taxes because of problems in that regard , let us rather create growth in that way .
i was very concerned yesterday when the hon minister of finance and development planning reported that in the past two years , just in the department of finance , we lost one computer and two laptops in 1998 to the value of r34 million ...
the new act lays down a series of requirements , and we will have to see to it that financial systems are put in place , that the officials are thoroughly trained in financial procedures , that financial requirements are met and that the officials are properly instructed in financial procurement administration .
] i have looked for a smoking gun , but i am not going to rumour-monger in this house , because the smoke that i saw , which was a faint whiff , is something which i am unable to prove .
madam chairperson , it is common knowledge that the government has pledged itself to an ambitious social development plan , which includes health care , education , houses and jobs , all cocooned in the world 's most libertarian constitution and supported by a mass of ultra-protective laws .
i pointed out to him that with natural attrition the saps for this year alone would shrink by 8 000 officers , which in effect means that the " design total " will be reached within months without any provision for stabilisation , growth or renewal .
incredible as it may sound , at the conference at which comm selebi was present , one of the national deputy commissioners said that the western cape was third on the crime list and not , as their statistics indicate , the province with the highest crime rate .
once again i ask that in deploying the community police officers there will be adequate determination of needs in the community so that we will really place these resources in areas where the support is most needed and where the communities need them most .
i wish to make an earnest appeal to the hon minister to arrange a meeting as soon as possible between himself , the relevant police divisions concerned with theft and farmers in the oudtshoorn area in an effort to address this problem as soon as possible .
a few graduates of this programme will be taken up and their services and skills utilised by the department of sport in various human resource development projects that will be run specifically at schools and many camps throughout the province .
our facilities programme will continue to focus on areas outside the metropolitan area to ensure that the basic sport and recreation facilities are made available to the poorest communities while , at the same time , we shall ensure that the upgrading of the athlone soccer stadium is completed .
we have passed 17 : 00 and the aeroplane has flown over already , but if hon members listen to the reply , i shall be as quick as i can and they will not have to ask the questions in repetition next time .
mr chairperson , it was none other than the former national minister of education , prof sibusiso bengu , who expressed this best in a seminal article he wrote for business day which was published on 12 march 1999 .
madam chairperson , i should like to extend my sincere thanks to the hon member mr a j williams for his very positive contribution , not only in his speech today but in all the contributions , including those of the standing committee and its staff during the year .
however , let me tell hon members , given the eloquent criticisms that are made of some of their bedfellows , the fact of the matter is that those criteria were based on national agreements that we implemented in this province .
these are references , to name but a few , of our revenue generating initiatives which will not only enable us to provide better service and access to the poorest of the poor , but will markedly improve public perceptions of our facilities .
i will appeal to the national minister and i hope he will understand that the bulk of 59 000 families will not have any income from 1 april 2001 , because they will not qualify for the child support grant .
this money became available in november last year , and the then minister of social services and poverty relief put a process in motion for the appointment of consultants to draw up a business plan on how this money should best be spent .
the comments made by margaret donga of the opposition party in robert mugabe 's so-called democratic government start to ring true when she said , " if you want to rule for a long time in africa you must keep your poor people poor .
i want to ask her whether in her own constituency - the hon minister of local government said that 32 % of the poorest pockets of poverty exist in the mitchells plain magisterial district - she will be able to tell the poor what she is doing for them .
i want to thank the officials for providing us with the necessary information to amend section 96 so that our people out there will be able to get on with their lives and make the necessary arrangements to take transfer of their property .
we need to do something to encourage the people on the ground - ratepayers and the public in general - to take part in the political process , to get involved in their ratepayers ' associations so that the figure of 4 % can be increased .
the problem we have with regard to the hon minister 's fulfilment of his task is that he is leading a party that is not clear at this stage about the kind of political alliance we need to deliver services at local government level effectively .
i also want to tell hon members this today : if they are looking for a municipality , with the few resources that such a municipality actually has , that truly has done something for the poor people , they should look at the municipality of oostenberg .
the legacy of apartheid education , however , has resulted in a short supply of professionals in the planning discipline , and we should be under no illusion as to the magnitude of the challenge we face in our attempts to introduce racial equity in this chief directorate .
madam chairperson , the western cape is in need of serious land reform , specifically to empower coloured and black people in rural areas , but also to reverse the effect of approximately 35 years of social engineering through the group areas act of 1960 .
when i reread what the hon minister said in his 100-day speech last year , i was struck by the fact that most of the deadlines that he set himself in that speech have not yet been met .
mr chairperson , i gladly take part in this debate and , having heard the hon minister of finance and development planning , with his passion for this department , talking about how technical it is , i want to congratulate him on his budget speech today .
i address this warning , that if it is not possible to sustain the province 's expert advice and leadership to local authorities during the process of transformation , our fine ideals of economic growth and job creation could come to nought , particularly in the rural areas .
i want to say now , and we will say it many more times in the standing committee and in the house , that if that is the direction that the cabinet is going to take under the de facto premier 's leadership , we are going to have a big fight on our hands .
to remain true to my objective of addressing strategic goal number four of our province 's policy goals , namely to contain the spread of hiv and tuberculosis , i wish to highlight some projects this department has undertaken .
] they are constantly asking other people to apologise for racism and everything they can think of , but they forget about the harm that you , mr byneveldt , and all of you did in telling people not to pay !
i am , however , disappointed that it has not proceeded much faster and the department - with mr petersen spearheading it - and i will try to speed it up so that at the end of this year we can establish the authority .
when one speaks about job creation , one remembers that much has been said about the poverty programme to be handled by the hon minister in the office of the premier , without providing a detailed plan of how that is going to be dealt with .
i believe that in the way it was structured the vehicle owners could have had an opportunity to select a route and decide whether they needed 10 vehicles or five , and whether it would be microbuses or whatever .
the court ruled that , in as far as the bill sought to regulate retail liquor trade , micro manufacturing - which will include our wine farms - and sorghum production , it intruded on the exclusive legislative competence of the province and the bill was therefore unconstitutional .
madam chairperson , in the meantime we are embarking , as we must in terms of the constitution and the constitutional court 's ruling , on our own legislative process to create provincial law on those aspects of liquor licensing which the constitution reserves for our attention .
before closing i would like to add my congratulations to the hon minister for the instrumental role he has played in getting the convention centre in this city to the stage where it is now a reality and not just a dream .
a big issue that many participants at that conference - in fact , the majority - mentioned was that the biggest challenge for the knowledge society and the knowledge economy was , through the use of icts , to deal effectively with poverty in the world .
among the guidelines that are included are that the poverty in the rural areas that was associated with the apartheid policy must of course be rectified ; and that the focus of equal access to all agricultural resources and agricultural services must be extended to all farmers , including emerging farmers .
however , we propose an amendment in the bill under consideration to allow for consultation forums under section 30b ( 2 ) because we understand that problems of this nature require stakeholder discussions for a meaningful solution .
there are many people who are unable to put bread on their tables due to the unacceptable situation that has developed between the codeta and cata taxi factions on the one side , and the golden arrow bus services on the other .
mr speaker , there are certain aspects which i must address in the light of the fact that the western cape has the second biggest urban population in south africa , with approximately 87 % of the total population in the province living in urban areas .
in this instance , urgent appeals were addressed by the former deputy president and now president of south africa , president mbeki , to all directors-general in all the provinces , that we support the independent electoral commission financially and with resources , irrespective of whether we used officials or teachers .
on top of that , while that was all happening the director-general of home affairs , mr albert mokoena , whom some might remember , was busy calculating which soccer pitch his soccer team should be working on , rather than actually organising an efficient voter registration campaign .
it was goebbels who , let me remind the hon minister of finance and development planning , was a very good friend of the np during the war , and who said that if one repeated a lie often enough people would believe it .
i do not know if half or a quarter of a public servant volunteered in sport and recreation , or whether , using some creative accounting , the responsible minister sucked out r120 to round off his figures .
i have no statistics here , but i would like to suggest that 90 % - 80 % at least - of the people whom we registered were from among the poorest of the poor who could not afford to register .
for those who do have them , we would like to know the details of how each of those line item amounts in the central fund was spent - the total number of officials , how much each official was paid , what their post levels were and from which departments they came ?
madam chairperson , in the meetings of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling last year , where we were allowed to ask questions , it became quite clear that the department of environmental affairs urgently needed about r1 million for pollution control .
there can be very few circumstances - and no circumstances that i can think of offhand - that would justify teachers being taken out of classrooms when they are needed to be teaching our children , especially in disadvantaged areas .
madam chairperson , could we get an indication from the hon premier then , if it was up to an amount of r1 000 , was the discretion left to the ministers , the heads of departments or who , to determine what that incentive was going to be ?
if i were able to ask questions to the two former ministers who are sitting in the house in regard to their portfolios at the time that they were running , whatever they may say now to interject , they would not be able to have that knowledge either .
that the house congratulates the da on the outstanding victory in the recent municipal elections and specifically congratulates the councils that elected a strong da management with the fact that the communities accepted the challenge to develop model towns for the future .
the hon premier can activate the civil service , the cabinet and the provincial parliament to draw up regulations which would have teeth for the national legislation outlawing gang membership , so that we can seriously set about the implementation of that law .
the western cape , with the lowest incidence of hiv / aids in the country , could either claim easy victories or seize a unique opportunity with our lower base of hiv / aids and therefore hopefully a more controllable base of hiv / aids in the western cape .
what i have to add , however , is that in the same way we must more effectively give our people in our residential areas , in the residential area on the cape flats and in the townships , the feeling that they are safe and that they are in fact kept safe .
before the christmas holidays the unicity mayor said they were going to call a suspension on evictions , but right now people in st montague village in lavender hill are being evicted because they are unemployed and they cannot keep up with the rental payments .
i want to bring a classic case in point to the attention of this house , mr speaker , because the anc raised it now in the house and at a press conference in the city hall yesterday and predictably twisted the facts , as they continue to do .
if he had dealt with the economic development and empowerment of the people in those communities and if he were really as truthful as he says he is here today , we would have turned around the lives of the people living along the n2 .
what is important to me is that the hon premier has announced that among the five focus points this year will be that the province is planning , in cooperation with local government , to focus on the development of the rural areas , with special reference to the farm workers .
two recent incidents of which i have personal knowledge , unlike some other people who commented on one of the incidents , underscore the great divide between reality and the smoke and mirror images that the hon premier attempted to create here yesterday .
the total amount of r135 million was allocated as follows : roads , for specific projects , r79 million ; works , r41 million , which , if i remember correctly , included education ; poverty relief , r10 million ; and project chrysalis , r5 million , which adds up to r135 million .
i call upon those organisations that feel that this is a process of party politics - the stadium was full of people being addressed - not to play politics with our lives if they do not stay in khayelitsha or guguletu .
i said that this government expected the full rule of law to be enforced , and from the time that i spoke to him they then , within the next four hours , arrested 97 taxi operators and impounded the taxis , ...
we are convinced that , as the hon minister also indicated , the spin-off effects of a convention centre - in that convention visitors and their companions spend considerable sums of money on accommodation , shopping and other things , such as sightseeing - will add up and convert into job creation .
therefore , there is an added responsibility upon the provincial parliament to scrutinise not only the legislation but that which preceded the legislation , that which the legislation seeks to ratify and to authorise , namely the shareholders ' agreement .
the shareholders ' agreement contains a provision which stipulates that in the event of a guarantee being issued by any of the three or four shareholders , they jointly and severally indemnify each other against any losses which may be suffered pursuant to the issuing of such a guarantee .
there is a western province cricket team , rugby team , hockey team - as the hon leader of the opposition knows - and many other things called the " western province " , but there is no such thing as a " government of the western province " .
madam chairperson , with respect , if you look at the standing committee amendments before the house , you will see that on clause 5 they state : on page 3 , in line 35 , to omit " shareholders " and to substitute " convenco " .
the committee wishes to express its concern regarding the lack of a formal agreement between the administration and the state information technology agency ( sita ) for the rendering of computer services and that expenditure amounting to r4 604 071 in this regard could not be verified during audit .
( 3 ) believing that the failure of the premier and the new np leadership to take disciplinary steps against members facing such charges brings into question the new np 's commitment to fighting corruption ;
mr speaker , the hon minister will remember that the new np unicity commissioners undertook to speak to him about this issue , because even they found it necessary to include the executive mayor structure in the unicity system .
i refer particularly to giving hope to the coloured working-class areas where , admittedly , the anc has not been able to persuade a significant number of coloured working-class people that it can be a comfortable home for them .
that the house calls on the minister of finance , business promotion and tourism to urgently present to the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling a report dealing with his authorisation of the appropriation of r8,6 million towards the western cape gambling and racing board .
they used the beaches , they traded in the cbds of other areas , and they used roads and transport networks without having to contribute to the cost of either provision or the maintenance of any of the roads outside pinelands .
there are not only divisions between rich and poor , but the divisions between white and black are evidenced by the fact that almost all households lacking access to basic services in the cape metropole are coloured and african households .
if there is going to be a 1 000 % or a 2 000 % increase - and none of us knows what it is going to be - then a longer period of phasing-in is necessary , whether we want to accept that reality or not .
mr speaker , clearly this matter is not of importance to the hon premier or the provincial government , and despite the calls of residents and ratepayers - even dp councillors - the da coalition thinks it can delay this matter endlessly .
convenco is white old boys ' club looking after white power and privilege , and the sooner this house and the hon minister recognise that , the sooner we will deal with the issues of transformation in the house , leave aside the questions of ethics and morality .
one is his role as a member of the cabinet , which is entirely correct , and , as it provides in par 2.3 ( f ) , he may not " expose ( himself ) to any situation involving the risk of a conflict " .
" i certainly , because of my involvement , would have been prepared to raise the matter again if mr mowzer had mentioned it , but there was not a word from mr mowzer , even though disclosure of interest was an item on the agenda .
the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling , having considered the subject of the western cape ninth gambling and racing amendment bill [ b12-2000 ] , referred to it , begs to report the bill without amendment .
i live in blue downs , eerste river , where within the space of a few days we buried four young children because the hand of crime touched them and their families - children who were entitled to a future .
mr speaker , i wish to convey my thanks and appreciation to the hon minister of community safety for the very important role played by him and his men in the efforts made , together with his colleagues at the national level , to put a stop to this terror .
more dangerously , we are sending a signal to the perpetrators that they do indeed have the ability to divide us , exploit our differences and undermine our resolve to deal with them uncompromisingly , whoever they may be .
not only white south africans , but middle class south africans of all races who have options to seek a future elsewhere are increasingly doing so , because they do not want a replay of the divisive politics of racial division sown by the anc .
against a backdrop of two incident-free football matches , one of which was attended by more than 25 000 spectators , incident-free , a small group of racists led by a da councillor say they support rugby and cricket being played there - read " predominantly white audiences " .
] if one speaks to those who have supported the anc over the last few years , one will find that they are shocked and disillusioned by endless allegations of corruption and cover-up from a party that is now only paying lip-service to democratic accountability .
mr speaker , in the so-called coloured urban areas predictions were that only between 42 % and 45 % voted , and therefore the hon minister of community safety was wrong yesterday to say that they had the majority of the votes .
mr speaker , on the cultural side we have already seen the phenomenal success of the cape coons , and by the end of this year we will have a street festival where all the citizens of cape town can experience the unique cape celebration of second new year 's day .
i am a bit reluctant to say what i am going to say , because i do not want it to reflect negatively on the family , but i had a sense that there was almost a resigned acceptance in that family of what has happened .
the actions which are to be implemented by my colleague the hon minister of community safety to strengthen the police force shows that this government is prepared to take on the challenge to make the western cape a safer and better place to live in .
this is essential so that all our people in the western cape - coloured , indian and african - can truly feel and believe that they are not part of die " ons " in the poem by adam small , where he says that " ...
after the elections , with the new rationalisation regulation , the mayor of the municipality of drakenstein , which includes wellington , paarl , gouda and saron , finds himself in the position of having to play a ceremonial and executive role for an allowance of r33 000 .
those voters who used to support the new np - including the voters on the south coast and the west coast , areas which used to be vital np strongholds - have all turned their backs on them and voted for the anc , allowing the anc ...
madam speaker , the hon premier of the western cape opened the second session of parliament last week and in his opening address he referred to this wonderful , vibrant , modern and sophisticated province - a winning province and a province he is proud of .
if one reads the book the bisho letters one will understand why so many mothers are coming to the western cape hospitals to give birth to their children and why so many children are coming to the western cape schools to try and get an education .
i was asked to speak on this matter at a very late stage , when we were already in the house , after our party whip had observed his presence in the house and realised that this matter deserved attention in his presence .
they will do anything to get a place in a western cape school , including indulging in fraud by getting a forged report card - an action that the hon member mr ozinsky would probably condone as long as the fraudster had a genuine anc membership card .
in fact , it is sad to note that it happened once he had accomplished his mission - they needed him during the election campaign to make sure that he brought in coloured votes for the new np .
it is simply not honest of us to carry on feeding south africa 's people with dreams , hopes and rhetorical examples of a non-existent south african miracle while our families all see inflation reduce the value of their income every day .
when the hon leader of the opposition wants to address poverty relief , he will find no foreign investment , no jobs and the perpetuation of appalling living conditions because his party fails to secure the lives of all south africans .
on 10 january 2000 , one mr abraham baadjies , who had been working on the farm parys near leipoldtville for four years - the hon minister of transport and works will know where that is - experienced the cold cruelty of racism in the province .
last week employers said that if a case arose in which they went to the magistrates ' court and asked for an order allowing a worker to be legally evicted , a probation officer had to be appointed in terms of the probation services act , 1991 ( act 116 of 1991 ) .
i would like to complete my speech , and we all want to go home , so could i desperately request you to ask the hon member mr ozinsky if he would be kind enough not to continue with his running commentary .
turning to capital expenditure , hon members will be aware that severe cutbacks were made to provincial capital expenditure for the 1999-2000 financial year , due to the delay in receipt of the casino bid fee and formula adjustments to the western cape 's equitable share as a result of poorer macroeconomic conditions .
during the nearly 80 years that the np was in power in this province they in a very determined manner found ways to move resources from the periphery of the old cape province into the western cape - more especially into the cape town area .
the way in which clear objectives and strategic frameworks were set out in the budget suggests a management style that will once again ensure that this province , under the leadership of premier gerald morkel , will not tolerate corruption or misspending of the taxpayers ' money .
i would not want to give anyone a further kiss of death by singling them out - dr stegmann may already have received enough kisses of death - but by and large we are happy to support the broad brush strokes of the budget .
madam chairperson , if we take all these learning experiences and consolidate them , this office can contribute more effectively and constructively to the new-look vote 1 : premier , director-general and corporate services , because we have a clear vision and direction and we do have a business plan .
it was inevitable that the catering contract of the administration would have to go out to tender , that the speaker could not interfere with the tendering procedure and that the tender board ensured that the new tender was awarded , on the basis of the board 's conditions , to sixel and patterson .
a very important task that lies ahead for us in the remainder of this year is to start giving effect to section 27 of the constitution of the western cape , namely to draft a code of conduct for members of the provincial parliament .
today the speaker , in introducing the budget , made a statement demonstrating that lines must be drawn regarding the responsibility of the provincial parliament and the empowerment of members to fulfil their responsibilities , as i said earlier .
as far as the implementation of rule 80 of the standing rules is concerned , namely that parties should be funded in order to be able to fulfil their responsibilities , i wish to request that it be implemented and that the empowerment of smaller parties be approached with sensitivity .
we know that not all the parties are satisfied with that , and i want to tell the three hon members who referred to this issue that the speaker will keep a check on this - the speaker is there to protect the minority parties .
mr speaker , the hon minister of local government is correct when he says it is not on his desk ; it is on the desk of the hon premier and the hon premier has said he will take responsibility for it .
mr speaker , the simple truth is that the southern peninsula , helderberg , oostenberg and cape town simply will not have enough land at their disposal for housing within the foreseeable future and that we have to look at only two current substructures , namely tygerberg and blaauwberg .
in essence our reservations are that there are constitutional shortcomings in the legislation that have to be addressed to avoid a situation where the legislation is undermined from the outset by protracted litigation in a court .
as far as the annual report of the tender board is concerned , i would like to point out that section 12 ( 1 ) and 12 ( 2 ) in the provincial tender board law quoted by the hon member contain the word " practicable " .
mr speaker , i would like to know from the hon minister what steps he is taking to ensure capacity for his department so that taxpayers do not have to wait so long before the services they expect from the government are actually provided .
if this system is being implemented to increase revenue for the department , and to increase efficiency , how can he honestly say that a delay in its implementation leads to no cost to the province and no loss of income ?
i rule that questions 5 and 6 should stand over , and also question 11 , because the hon member mr strachan is not here and might be present at a later date when the question will be answered by the hon minister of finance and development planning .
mr speaker , owing to the giant success of the klein-karoo nasionale kunstefees in oudtshoorn i should like to ask the hon premier of the western cape how he experienced the arts festival and what his opinion is about future support for the nasionale kunstefees in oudtshoorn .
mr speaker , i would like the hon premier to respond to the fact that these requests in regard to robertson , grabouw and worcester were made on 14 january 2000 and the motivation for the west coast district council was made on 27 october 1999 .
( 1 ) the conditions of approval are contained in annexure a. three conditions that have not been met are the following : finalisation of the grotto bay management plan , the declaration of the private nature reserve and the transfer of land within the grotto bay development to the home-owners ' association .
( 2 ) whether any of these security guards have undergone a thorough security clearance check ; if so , ( a ) what did this imply and ( b ) whether this information is readily available for scrutiny ; if not , why not ; if so , when will this information be furnished ;
mr speaker , i should like to ask the hon premier what short-term and long-term economic benefits for the western cape are entailed by the resent visit to china by the hon premier , in particular in respect of the economic empowerment of the previously disadvantaged communities .
however , mr speaker , what is good about it is that they say they have confidence in this country - and it is not only china saying this , but other countries as well - then their starting point will be the western cape .
any official can make use of the grievances procedure as prescribed in the civil service act , 1977 ( act 46 of 1997 ) , and as read with section 196 ( 4 ) ( f ) ( xii ) of the constitution of the republic of south africa .
the hon minister needs to tell the province , and specifically black businesses whom he invited to breakfast on the occasion of the presentation of his 100-day plan , that he made a promise and he was not able to deliver .
i would like to say that i am satisfied with the precautions that have been put into place - i have been taken through them step by step - and i am satisfied with the integrity of the people who will be handling this matter at every level .
" the leader of the opposition : mr speaker , in follow-up , could the hon premier state categorically to the house and guarantee that his office , the provincial government and the provincial administration have not contributed one cent to the publishers of pmr over the last few years ?
mr speaker , while focusing this address on the five key priorities of the government over the next year , i am by no means ignorant of the excellent work done in other fields by the government and its administration .
although we find that it is important that everybody should be there , i have a problem with the principle that there should be 25 people sitting in a meeting on an adjustments appropriation , as they come in and literally sit for two minutes and then leave .
the reason is that at the adjustments appropriation meetings we know exactly which programme is going to be dealt with , and to get people from other programmes to come and sit there , using valuable time is , i believe , not to be recommended .
section 31 of that act provides for the provincial minister responsible for financial matters to table an adjustments budget in the provincial parliament and , specifically , section 31 ( 2 ) stipulates the conditions under which such an adjustments budget may be tabled .
mr speaker , as hon members , including the hon leader of the opposition who made the allegation , all know , i visited the scene of the tornado with president mbeki and i was there on the sunday when it happened .
it is interesting to me that the hon member mr winde has announced today that the environmental impact study has now been approved - a few hours ago it had not been approved - and that he was making this announcement today on behalf of the minister .
the first is a general tax ; the second is an extraordinary tax that can be levied by me in a municipal area ; the third is a health tax ; the fourth is a water tax ; and the fifth is a special tax .
to stay and serve in south africa generally , and in the western cape specifically , is to remain at centre stage in one of the most breathtaking scenarios of human drama and challenge in all history .
madam chairperson , because we had the opportunity , a day or two ago , to attend a submission on the new public finance management act , it was very clear to me that it was essential for the management team to have a well-trained financial infrastructure .
i will certainly take all of the matters they have raised into consideration , especially my undertaking to see that the question of the his matter comes before scof so that they can receive a full explanation in response to any questions which they wish to ask .
as with the previous financial year , when the police budget shrank in real terms by 2 % , this year 's budget sees an 8,1 % increase , which in effect is a negative growth given the severe backlog that has to be made up .
we now have the absurd situation where reservists are being pulled in more and more to do the work of professionals , while professionals are being allowed to moonlight on private jobs to supplement their income , thereby keeping them in the service .
madam chairperson , the abused groups aspects included the following : self-defence classes were offered in conjunction with victim empowerment programmes ; talks were given by people who had been abused one way or the other ; and alison , from port elizabeth , drew more than 2 000 people on two consecutive evenings and had a capacity to draw even more .
madam chairperson , i wish to make an earnest appeal to the hon minister and his department to develop programmes together with the western cape education department , as a matter of urgency , to put a stop to the widespread vandalism that so many of our educational institutions are saddled with .
we are the descendants of the khoikhoi , the afrikaner and the white english settlers of the 19th century , as well as our xhosa settlers from across the provincial border and all their descendants , not to mention those brought here as slaves .
when people make reference to , " one settler , one bullet " , or , in a more recent case , " burning the province " , as a sign of protest at their political unhappiness , i ask what perception is being generated in the minds of the public .
madam chairperson , i would first like to deal with the immediate business at hand , which will be a short retrospective on what we have been doing over the past nine months , and what we plan to do with our budget allocation of r4 billion in the year ahead .
in the end , on that particular day , circuit inspectors and members from the head office went to schools unannounced - schools were not forewarned , they were not brought on board - and the officials took away all the reports , all the registers , everything .
he is precisely the kind of principal who acknowledges the burden of the past , but sees himself as responsible or co-responsible for creating the future and that is why we gave him r100 000 to put in a computer laboratory at his school .
i will highlight a few of those benefits : the decline in the number of workers by 27 % ; the decline in the number of beds in hospitals by 25 % ; and the decline of the expenditure of the department of health by 9,4 % during the 1999-2000 financial year .
special attention needs to be given to cost-effective treatment and control methods of some infectious diseases with a strong involvement of families and communities , and there is a need to coordinate the public sector activities with ngos , the private sector and interested parties at all levels of health care .
this suggests that despite the problems that this department has encountered over the past few years , they are still managing to provide a much better than average service - in their own words , certainly one of the best services in south africa .
the medical research council is in bellville and it would not be inappropriate if funding could be found to have such an institute in the western cape .
i am sure that each and every member of this house would concur that delivery to the people of this province who do not have food or shelter , cannot be kept in limbo while we sort out administrative and management problems .
observing the anc during the budgetary process of the last few weeks has left me wondering how they are handling their own national minister for welfare and population development , who has not spent designated money to the poorest of the poor .
should we not do so we will end up asking for more and more money each and every year , or perhaps we will overspend on our welfare budget as the eastern cape has done by r184 million , or kwazulu-natal who has overspent to the tune of r188 million .
and that in spite of circular 10 / 93 , which was sent to them as long ago as 1993 , and in spite of the fact that the department of housing interacted with them repeatedly and explained to them how the process should take place .
madam chairperson , i am very grateful that we as a committee - and i wish to associate myself with what the chairperson of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling said this morning - unanimously approved the municipal ordinance , 1974 , amendment bill this morning .
they are the transformation of local government ; the financial viability of local government ; to provide a network of effective local government infrastructure ; the coordination of disaster management ; the participation of local government in national and provincial developmental programmes ; and the development of a local government service delivery ethos .
it was heartbreaking to hear of the incident to which the hon member mr n m isaacs referred a couple of days ago when he moved a motion of condolence in connection with the people who were burnt to death in their house in bishop lavis .
we are glad that the hon minister of local government in his management support audits has looked at all municipalities and that those municipalities that have been identified for management support programmes cover all municipalities and are not confined to those governed by a particular political party .
it is quite clear that in embarking on this huge transformation of local government , and given the present financial and management problems experienced by municipalities , all new category b and c municipalities , as well as the unicity , will require some form of programmatic support .
( 2 ) welcomes this step as a further step on the road to change , progress and a non-racial western cape , especially mindful of the fact that the anc kept on raising the issue with great commitment over a period ; and
( 2 ) welcomes this step as a further step on the road to change , progress and a non-racial western cape , especially mindful of the fact that the anc kept on raising the issue with great commitment over a period ; and
the department advertised for nominations in this regard , but the nominations received were not such that , as the hon minister has said today , he could approve them , so they have been forced to readvertise for nominations .
i wonder what dr stegmann thinks about this , because he told us that we should not work out of the white book , but out of the gold book and the hon minister comes and gives us what i call the " pink book " !
it is gratifying to hear from the hon minister of finance and development planning that the department has already provided manuals , new policy and financial support to local authorities and that he has indicated in his budget that they will continue to do so in the coming financial year .
while there could be a case for saying that the legacy of apartheid has had an impact on professionals in this field , there are a number of black - i use " black " in the generic sense - and women professionals in the field .
what is happening is in the interests of consolidating a great deal of power in the hands of the de facto premier of this province , the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism , whose party already controls 60 % of the budget .
i am hoping that on the back of a solid performance of this component in the coming year its budget will be substantially increased to give meaning to our commitment to providing a better life and future for all our people .
the call to action is a call to go beyond simply educating people about the dangers of contracting the dreaded virus or somehow scaring them into risk averse behaviour .
as regards the environment , whilst we as the acdp do not foresee a problem with the paradigm shift regarding section 24 in the bill of rights , that more emphasis will be laid on the welfare of our people as a point of departure , we need to be cautious .
yes , i have tried to read everything and i have tried to listen to everything , but last year when hermanus became my service area , the writing as far as this dispute is concerned was already on the wall , and in december 1999 the final breach followed .
what we are now asking is that an exception be made specifically in the case of the housing act , where we speak about local government , as well as the housing development board , where people buy that house in terms of the purchase scheme of r7 500 and also in terms of the housing act .
may our creator help us in this house to use our talents and assets to serve the people of the western cape better , and may our faith in our heavenly father lift us on eagles ' wings to reach even greater heights .
madam chairperson , i would like to ask the hon minister and the department , as well as the new np and the cabinet , to have another look at the 25 % increase - for the sake of helping the poor and keeping industry in the province .
hon members must always remember , when they move motions , to say in advance , " i give notice that i shall move , " in which case the motion will come up later , or , " i move without notice , " in which case the motion comes up immediately .
last but not least , regarding this department , when we look at and analyse asset management , we see that we are spending capital expenditure amounting to r3,63 million just on personnel , and we have made provision for r19,210 million on special services .
we will feed back to the hon minister our findings on those things , and we will obviously have constructive engagement with the ministry about the issues raised both at the summit on job creation and job security and in the hearings on racism in the workplace .
it is a statutory right and we cannot interfere with it , but we , in cooperation with the cape information technology initiative , are entering into discussions with telkom - i have already - to see how they can deliver on the vision which we have .
] the inclusivity debate was about the fact that the anc wanted to force the coalition partners in the western cape to include the anc here , but the anc was not prepared in other parts of south africa to honour the principle of " racial inclusivity " .
under empowerment i understand giving people who have not had opportunities in the past , who were discriminated against and who suffered as a result of that , equitable opportunities of advancement in life , of which the most important is ultimately to get a job .
i do not wish to elaborate on this further apart from saying that the result of this land deprivation is that the vast majority of brown and black rural inhabitants live on land which they do not own ; accordingly they are dependent on white commercial farmers .
we are encountering a total insensitivity , and when one takes all the factors mentioned into consideration it is quite clear that the department , together with the western cape agricultural development service and the proposed policy in relation to farm workers , is tending to impoverish our people further as far as land is concerned .
we are the descendants of the khoikhoi , the afrikaner and the white english settlers of the 19th century , as well as our xhosa settlers from across the provincial border and all their descendants , not to mention those brought here as slaves .
when people make reference to , " one settler , one bullet " , or , in a more recent case , " burning the province " , as a sign of protest at their political unhappiness , i ask what perception is being generated in the minds of the public .
i would also like to thank mr petersen , the head of transport , for what they did , as well as messrs abrahamson and osman , ms roux from the directorate : transport , and mr roux , the registrar of transport , who assisted us very ably in getting the legislation drafted .
other provinces , like kwazulu-natal and gauteng , passed transport legislation in 1998 , on a range of matters affecting operators in public transport , including providing a tool to ensure that the rule of law applied to every person inside and outside the operation .
mr speaker , i dedicate my speech to the late mr patrick luvo ganuganu , a bus driver who died in the taxi violence on 16 april last month , and also to mr majola , the taxi driver who was shot on 11 may 2000 in the crossfire and died .
mr speaker , a very bitter cup came round , shots were fired and at uitsig and matroosfontein the families of gosh , jansen and thompson were specifically asked to drink from this cup , a cup which has been to so many already .
pastor duckitt was on the way to a prayer meeting - he heard the sirens , saw the commotion further up the street , saw the police lights flashing , arrived on the scene and was greeted by the lifeless body of his daughter rene - shot dead .
it is very clear that when a white child disappears in the western cape suddenly there is enough political will and enough pressure on the part of the hon minister 's office to make the criminals account for their actions , but when a brown child suffers the same thing , there are not enough police personnel .
the standing committee on economic development , having considered the subject of the western cape road transportation act amendment bill [ b7-2000 ] referred to it , begs to report the bill with amendments [ b7b-2000 ] .
should the money that was spent then and the money for the contract which has now been rejected by the tender board not be going to other projects in disadvantaged communities , instead of to the poverty alleviation programmes of the hon minister of social services and poverty relief ?
mr speaker , for instance , attached to the letter that was sent to all public servants on 16 november 1999 by dr ncholo , the director-general of the department of public service and administration , from which the hon member mr ismail quoted , it is stated , and i quote :
with regard to the desired return achieved , i am pleased to inform the house that the initiative of the cabinet decision contributed to the increase in voter registration of 787 937 voters between the first and final rounds of registration .
madam chairperson , in the light of the constant request from the department of health and welfare for more money from the national health budget , could we now take it from the hon minister that they no longer require that additional money ?
if i had been given prior notice , as a matter of courtesy , of the questions hon members wish to ask , i would have been able to answer them accurately , but it is not my intention to attempt to answer them as the information i may give the house is inaccurate .
madam chairperson , in the light of the fact that these are contemporary issues and not issues from a previous period , did the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs apply his mind to the range of possibilities from which the money could be spent , the programmes ?
that the house notes with concern that the nnp / dp alliance is silent on the decision by the cape town unicity executive council to use ratepayers ' money to enrich themselves by buying new cars and using chauffeurs to drive these cars .
the vulnerable include our children , who carry with them probably our greatest guarantee of a future free from our past , and yet their very vulnerability and innocence have marked them as the potential victims of abusers inside and outside of their families .
the example of ireland to which the hon premier referred is something which i think that we as a province should really follow up in an effort to determine how we can link our foreign investors to small business enterprises in order to give effect to this idea .
sixteen of them in one group and 17 in the other were put in the back of a light truck , not much bigger than that of the hon member mr king , and transported between 500 km and 600 km to a farm near piketberg .
remember , they were taken away from their place of origin , 500 km to 600 km from where they were found , and they were brought to a farm where they had to work , in the hope that they could return and take something back to their people .
the proper procedure would have been to send that money back to treasury , and for the department to have taken its time to work out a plan for the use of that money and to put that plan into the budget for the coming year .
he changed his plans and he flew down the next day and we had a very high level meeting with the hon minister of transport and works and senior generals of the army , as well as a very senior corps of the police , both provincially and nationally .
mr speaker , in reaction to the hon member mr ozinsky the hon minister lost it a little and in that interaction said in afrikaans that the hon member did not know what he was talking about and , " hou jou bek !
when we come to whether we will perform financially , it is very interesting to note that cape town has already climbed to the 28th global position for conventions , together with rome and sao paolo , drawing some 84 000 visitors last year .
madam chairperson , i agree with you that you should put the original clause , but with the amendment , because if you put the original clause and this amendment together they read differently from the one in [ b9b-2000 ] as you have correctly indicated .
furthermore , the committee again wishes to recommend that where instances of fraud , theft or malpractice by an official is committed with the assistance or complicity of private enterprises , such enterprise be placed on a list of undesirable contractors and that such list is regularly circulated to all state institutions .
therefore calls on the premier to immediately expel mr a williams and the councillor concerned from the new np and apologise to the communities of the west coast for the abuse of funds intended for development in these communities .
as i previously indicated , according to the bill before the house and the local government : municipal structures act , 1998 ( act 117 of 1998 ) , the provincial minister and the provincial government have the obligation to ensure that municipalities perform their functions effectively .
when the anc overplayed their hand with the judiciary , particularly in regard to the allan boesak case , it was late chief justice mahomed and judge president chaskalson who immediately issued a joint statement about what they called " a deplorable attack on the judiciary " .
i want to say from the outset - and perhaps as a layman i interpret things differently to people from the legal profession - that it is clear to me that there is a difference between the two concepts " criticism " and " interference " .
therefore calls on the new np leadership in the province to assert their leadership of the coalition and allow their membership to publicly condemn these attempts to create instability in the new np .
whenever bank guarantees are spoken about , one hears about discrimination ; whenever bridging finance is spoken about one hears about racial practices ; and whenever credit rating is spoken about one hears how smmes forfeit their contracts and also jobs .
the anc may state that it is the party of the poor and underprivileged in the western cape , but this is only true in the sense that its policies serve only to keep the poor impoverished and the economically disadvantaged , disadvantaged .
andre gaum said , " this is all politics ; it is not true . we can see that the local elections are coming , " but i am happy to see that the hon member mr gelderblom has corrected that .
if the socio-economic conditions that our country wants , and the objectives that our country would like to set itself are the upliftment of the previously disadvantaged , how can the country cede to a banking institution the right of whether it will be implemented ?
( 3 ) the provincial cabinet , in stark contrast to other provinces , has not been able to produce sufficient legislation or policy to enable the house and its standing committees to function regularly and effectively ; and
that the house expresses its appreciation to constable wellman somlotha , constable mpumelelo landu and sergeant sebenzile vetbooi who were wounded on saturday while protecting the public on a train between khayelitsha and philippi , thanks them for their sacrifice and wishes them a speedy recovery .
valuable knowledge and insight have been gained over the past three years and it can now be said that we are in a much better position to truly grasp the full range of issues pertaining to gambling and what our responsibilities as regulators are in this regard .
the board is currently engaged with all the relevant role-players in this regard and has also recently approved rules determining the maximum length of stay in a crche or child-care facility attached to a casino development for children under the age of 12 years .
( 2 ) the minister of finance and development planning is a director and shareholder of a number of hotels and restaurants and is currently a director on the board of the cape town international convention centre company which also has as its brief the development of a hotel ; and
( 3 ) at no point did the minister of finance and development planning recuse himself from discussions relating to this hotel project ; therefore calls for the minister 's replacement as the province 's representative as director on the board of convenco .
mr speaker , given the hon premier 's performance in this debate , it is very clear that we in fact could not expect anything less than his appointment of the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism to the board of convenco .
we must make sure , as i think the hon leader of the opposition also said , that we are satisfied that the security forces have all the resources at their disposal to do their job and then we have to support them - all of us .
in the context of the race debate it is probably necessary to pause a while on the issue of the franschhoek pass murders because it turned into the most perverse display of inverted race logic we have seen in south africa for a long time .
while she stood at the microphone , a member of parliament , dene smuts , had the whole conference on racism waiting for her input in response to the debate of the morning , where there was a large contribution from pallo jordan .
their number two in the house is also not a person that can be classified , by their definition , as a black person ; their spokesperson for the house is not , by their definition , a black person ; and their deputy speaker is not , by their definition , a black person .
we wish to cooperate with the hon minister , but if he says or creates the impression that there is nothing wrong and that everything is fine on the farms , how does he think the farm workers feel who are called " kaffir " and " hottentot " ...
it was also foreseen that farm worker communities , with the assistance of legislation passed in the national assembly , would gain title rights on farms and what is more that the human dignity of those communities would be restored so that they could increase their already immeasurable contributions to the gross domestic product .
i want to hear in the reply of the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works - ten to one he will repeat that there are only a few rotten apples , and so on - what he is going to do about the rotten apples in the house .
the committee , having heard and considered evidence on the treasury replies , wishes to express its concern at the provincial administration 's opinion that it does not have sufficient powers to regulate , exercise control and implement certain measures at local governments .
similar to the conditions attached to last year 's r1 billion allocation to the provincial sphere for debt repayment , funds were made available to the province after an agreement was reached on expenditure and revenue levels for 1999-2000 and estimates of outstanding debt .
mr speaker , when it comes to development , i listened to what the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism said regarding the privilege that the province is going to have of making r100 million this year from the revenue of casinos .
perhaps with one exception they have cooperated , but i am afraid to say that in terms of governance for their 35 % or 40 % , or whatever it may be , of the people who voted for them they have become after-result merchants .
while the da has begun the critical task of moulding a new political order in south africa , it is the anc 's most fervent and loyal supporters who are now beginning to question the ability of their party and president to adequately address the problems of the nation .
it seemed to me that the hon minister of housing was doing very well and coping nicely with the responses , but it is clear that they have gone too far and disturbed the hon minister while making his speech .
since 1994 the western cape government has ensured that democratic values are maintained , that corruption is eradicated , that school tuition and standards are maintained at all levels , that circumstances conducive to economic growth are created and that effective management is the order of the day .
jobs have not been created , roads and pavements have not been tarred or cleaned , clinic and other services have deteriorated and the negative cash balances of municipalities have grown in exchange for nothing , in most cases , apart from small houses with the wind howling through holes in the structures .
since 1994 the anc has had four leaders , but what is surprising is that the two spin doctors , the hon members mr dugmore and ms essop , who have got the hon leader of the opposition into the most trouble over the last period , are still here .
some people have almost no need of a government - by and large they can take care of themselves - but for many , many others the gulf between their hopes for the future and their present circumstances can only be bridged by government itself .
in the case of paul , the psychologist , karin reed , after meticulous consideration and in consultation with her colleagues , fellow-psychologists , advised that paul be placed at one of the following schools - hon members should take note of this - herzlia , harold cressy , zonnebloem or milnerton .
my question to the hon premier - who is not in the house at the moment - and , together with him , to others in the western cape government is : if they cannot even control one senior policeman , how could they control an entire regional force such as the one they want ?
an explanation during debate is allowed only when a material part of a member 's speech has been misquoted or misunderstood , but the member may not be permitted to introduce any new matter , and no debate is allowed on such an explanation .
he then drove down to the charge office to make a statement and found that this could not be done as they had no ink for their stamp pads , no pens and no paper to take a statement .
however , what is essentially at stake is a decision that nobody except the new np can make - where they are going as a party and what they believe is important to them in the way that they contribute to building a new south africa .
mr speaker , i believe we are in a phase of reconstruction and delivery , in which all the resources of our government , civil society , business and labour need to be directed to eradicating poverty and ending racism once and for all .
the hon premier failed to realise that the poorest of the poor live in squatter communities and rural areas , and on farms ; that the poorest of the poor are single mothers , the aged and street children - those who have fallen out of the net .
mr speaker , what the anc do not realise though is that someone rather wiser and more ethical than goebbels said that " you can not fool all the people all of the time " because eventually the truth will come out .
following the rapid downsizing in the previous financial year when the branch ended with a deficit of only r3 million on a budget of r3 billion , we were given a budget for this year that , in nominal terms , was exactly the same as that of the previous year .
this tale of woe exists in many industries in our province , but it is an indictment upon the anc government who boast their concern for the poor , yet allow their coalition partner cosatu to dictate unrealistic wage expectations and labour laws that lead to massive job losses .
to further contribute to the budget reform process and to assist south africa in complying with internationally recognised government finance statistics reporting , financial data presented in the budget documentation have been translated into gfs classifications as accurately as possible .
the social services sector has received substantial reprieve in this budget and over the mtef period , and the challenge facing these services is to build on the improvements in resource utilisation and effectiveness of service delivery which has been achieved over the past few years .
all the departments , with the exception of two - and we are not sure what the reasons are in those instances - said that they had never been consulted by the hon minister on the transversal issues of gender , disability and youth .
i would like to start by commending the hon minister of finance and development planning and the department of finance , as well as the chairperson of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling , the hon member mr ismail , for doing a superb job .
madam chairperson , i agree with the argument that some of the people who settle here are productively active and are able to contribute to the economy , but i still need to be convinced that these people do not merely represent a drop in the migratory bucket .
to the hon premier , i wonder whether these decisions were made because it was a case of the new np / dp coalition seeking cooperation with a neo-nazi party , or because austria is one of the few countries that will speak to us in the western cape ?
i think we should convey to them the message that they are very welcome in our building and that we can organise admission tickets at any time for those who want to come here regularly , and also permanent admission tickets so that they can gain access to the building very easily .
( b ) my attendance there in a dual capacity was because i took the opportunity to familiarise myself with the work of my department in the southern cape region and the environmental issues pertaining to that region .
the hon minister said in his speech that by also visiting the office of the developer , and arranging a meeting with an official in cape town shows the western cape government 's determination to treat the public with courtesy and consideration .
mr speaker , i would firstly like to say that we on this side of the house fully endorse the hon premier 's contention that the most important thing for democracy in the western cape is to register as many voters as possible before the forthcoming elections .
( 1 ) ( a ) the budget of the subdirectorate : consumer services and fair trade for the budget year 2000-01 is as follows : consumer tribunal r 559 000 consumer education 632 000 attending to complaints 972 000 consumer liaison 222 000 r 2 385 000
mr speaker , as far as the word " practicable " is concerned , i am satisfied that when this law was brought about it did not state that it shall be three months or two months or any specific time after it had been issued .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon minister whether it is not the function of his department to look at illegal economic practices in this province and to take steps to stop them .
mr speaker , we have gone out of our way in this matter , while the hon member mr mckenzie , who started the rent-a-cop scheme , which is now the community patrol services , is trying to undermine it in more ways than one , as we heard here today .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon premier the following question : given the current wave of afro-pessimism in the international media , what can the western cape do to alleviate the negative image that continues to bedevil the continent ?
mr speaker , of course the hon minister of housing will go into a big emotional attack , but if he wants to know what the information is in terms of reserving posts , i will read a paragraph out of a bkv meeting that actually speaks about this .
( 1 ) whether he is committed to implement the be legal campaign to legalise illegal operators after two years of hesitation and / or refusal to address all the underlying and fundamental problems experienced by public transport operators ;
i went further and wrote a letter to the town clerk 14 days ago , in which i asked that if they had specific needs , they should inform me , after which we would consider them together with all the other requests for the next budget .
mr speaker , i want to know from the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works whether he does not find it strange that no grounds exist for discrimination with regard to all the allegations , or does he not care about those allegations ?
i will summarise the salient points of my reply now but i have taken the trouble of making my response available in text as well because i regard these issues as extremely important and would invite the hon member to consider the detail at his leisure .
mr speaker , in view of the fact that it is against policy , what would happen if the names of schools are revealed to the hon minister of education and she finds out that it has been done there , what action would the hon minister take against such schools .
( 2 ) since 1994 approximately 1 200 section 239 and item 28 ( 1 ) certificates have been issued in respect of properties situated in the western cape ; 669 of these properties vest in the province : western cape and the balance in the national government .
section 217 of the constitution of the republic of south africa , does not prevent an organ of state from implementing a procurement policy providing for categories of preference and the protection of advancement of persons or categories of persons disadvantaged by unfair discrimination .
as a full provincial audit of current services and resource allocations will only be undertaken by the disability desk during the new financial year , it is not possible to give a full account and its impact of all the specific programmes within the related areas .
when this province receives a pmr award , we must be twice as good as any other province , because there are 42 top economists in the department of trade and industry and they do not simply give away awards to a non-anc province like we are .
the details of votes affected and the amounts involved are set out in detail in the second adjustments estimate and the accompanying explanatory memorandum , but i would reiterate that the sums make no difference to the overall figure of r263,2 million .
as hon members heard the hon minister of health say , we will go out of our way to try to accommodate them , because they are all part of the south african nation , and we will not try to marginalise them the way the hon anc members do .
( 2 ) whether any flats at the sea front belong to the province ; if so , ( a ) how many , ( b ) who resides at such flats , ( c ) at what rates and ( d ) what is the vacancy level of such flats ;
the big thing is that i personally cannot spend hours in this house debating minor issues regarding whether we should have a secret ballot to overthrow the government and whether we should spend r2,5 million on voter registration .
he made specific pledges and demands and recommended actions - for a long period of time , may i say - to halt what is by their own admission a deteriorating situation and a collapsing criminal justice system .
madam chairperson , in all programmes that were run the people of the western cape were encouraged to be proactive with regard to their own safety and to make themselves and the community responsible for solutions to the issues of abuse happening in their midst .
i would like to especially mention mr chris du plessis for his handling of the festive season accounts and to congratulate both mr justin lottering - who is in the gallery at the moment - and mr engelbrecht for their appointments as chairperson and vice-chairperson of the provincial board respectively .
let me proceed with the charge sheet : the accused refuses and / or will not , alternatively is selective , and a further alternative is that he does not have the necessary abilities to comply with his rights and obligations in respect of our constitution and certain other legislation .
this leads me to ask if the hon minister and his department have had any part to play in marketing the western cape province for the 2006 soccer world cup bid and whether we are ready to host our fair share of matches .
it is all very well to say that we are going to give that money to ussasa , but it would help us if we were to put monitoring mechanisms in place to determine whether the r100 000 does ultimately reach the children that we want to help .
multiparty democracy requires a dynamic process of communication in which citizens are informed of decisions that may affect their lives , and mps and mpps engage in a process whereby the needs and challenges of the people are heard and possible solutions are discussed .
madam chairperson , our third priority is to focus on core areas of the curriculum , namely sciences , including maths , science , and information and communication technologies ; languages ; life skills , with a particular emphasis on hiv / aids ; and the full development of the further education and training band .
in the year ahead we again plan , in partnership with works , to complete seven new schools , namely kwafaku secondary , philippi k primary , sigcawu primary , du noon primary , imizamo yethu secondary , witlokasie primary and t n ndanda primary .
mr chairperson , once more a sincere word of thanks to my colleagues in project house , particularly my colleagues in the ministry - mr eddie kirsten and mr peter present , my new adviser - both of whom have added enormous value to the office .
even in a rare moment , such as this , when they enable me to curtail my speech , may i use this opportunity to thank the opposition for what have at times been important contributions in the interests of education , and not party-political point-scoring .
based on an assessment of long-term cost-effectiveness and need for the service , we have now taken a decision to purchase an mri machine for both groote schuur hospital and tygerberg hospital in the coming financial year , with the cost being spread over three years .
we need to develop in this country and , of course , in the province - i would like the hon minister to comment on this - proper hospital management strategies within the various hospitals , particularly the larger academic hospitals , which are the cash guzzlers in terms of the budget .
mr chairperson , if we are saying that this is a big bad apple , we must put our money where our mouth is , and have a committee that will ensure that we have a different and much more holistic approach to looking after the aged in this province .
she suggested that the department should have a contingency plan should the case result in absa losing the contract and there be a delay in the payment of grants to the beneficiaries ; these people cannot afford it .
it became clear from the complete lack of information on the matter , however , that it was not a desk , nor a directorate , but in fact a magic carpet - a magic carpet floating around aimlessly , since aladdin had been axed and the genie had disappeared .
in a period in which the political leadership of the department has been somewhat unstable - they are going through yet another new minister - the stabilising factor has been the officials leading the department , who have been fulsomely praised here this afternoon from all sides of the house .
although i promised not to bore hon members with old problems , i cannot but refer again to the fact that we simply do not receive enough funds to address the housing need in the western cape effectively .
the hon minister and his department , in cooperation with the western cape provincial housing development board , are trying actively to give effect to this constitutional provision , with the means at their disposal and in spite of the influx from other poorly governed provinces to this well-governed province of the western cape .
the hon member mr stali also complained about houses that were too small , but then his colleague mr jacobs came in and gave us a very good example of people doing something for themselves - sweat equity .
before i move on to discuss the other principal challenges which we face in the coming year , it may be useful to indicate the funds allocated to each of the cabinet objectives for which the chief directorate : development planning is responsible .
i must inform this parliament , however , that i was not satisfied that the nominations submitted would enable the premier to appoint a board which was meaningfully representative of the province 's population in terms of either race or gender .
the subdirectorate , after obtaining the 1996 census community profiles database from statistics sa , has also been involved in analysing the census data in order to identify the areas in the western cape where the registration of voters for the forthcoming municipal elections needs to be addressed .
we hope that in the next budget , or when the hon minister makes announcements on the fulfilment of his 100 day plans - i am not sure whether it is over yet - we will see a number of achievements in this department in relation to representation .
my motto is not to ride roughshod over a process in order to meet a deadline , but rather to take more time to arrive at something that is correct and has been given the correct attention in terms of public participation .
the western cape nature conservation board will administer a budget of r52 million and under its jurisdiction will fall 20 provincial nature reserves , 24 state forests , 8 nature reserves set aside in terms of the forests act , 4 wilderness areas , 6 marine reserves , 15 mountain catchment areas and 11 nature reserves on coastal islands .
in order to speed up the time taken to process applications and to diversify the skills base used to assess applications , the environmental management unit will employ the services of outside consultants to assist with assessments of applications .
in this regard we shall assist the regeneration of the cape coons , support the performing arts , hold at least 30 youth camps - 6 500 young people have already been through our youth camps this year - and administer and award provincial merit awards to artists in the performing arts .
all that i can conclude is that for ideological reasons - in other words , to have a small government - it was decided to outsource this matter and threaten the long-term survival of the environment in this province .
last week in the hermanus times the hermanus municipal council announced that a referendum would be held ; just like the referendum in 1995 , the result of which , dated 1 december 1995 , i have before me on my bench - an enormous majority vote for controlled opening .
the total budget amounts to r57,103 million and has been allocated as follows : environmental and cultural affairs and sport , r3 million ; health , r11,6 million ; social services , r2 million ; education , r22 million ; agriculture , r1,5 million ; general provincial buildings , r12 million ; rented buildings , r5 million ; and cleaning of buildings , r3,4 million .
the hon member mr ismail has just complimented the hon minister of transport and works on the fact that a start was made two years ago with spadework for the unique number-plates and the fact that the process is now under way and is generating money .
i must say today that i have realised the importance of our all tapping into one policy and direction for this province , and i must concede that i think that it is critical for any province to have one song sheet with one economic policy .
in addition to the noise , annie has to live with the intoxicated and obnoxious individuals who are ever-present outside her home , and she also has to deal with the illegal drug trade carrying on on her doorstep - let alone the odd stabbing or fist-fight .
] i could have accepted that , but at a work session in somerset west late last year a submission was made as to how we could involve the developing operators and how we could make it easier for them to become members of tourism bureaux .
further emphasises its concern that because of this statement a global group spearheading a drive to find a vaccine against the hiv virus called for a boycott of the international aids conference to be held in durban in july .
( 3 ) urges the provincial government to intervene to bring the situation to normality and protect the rights of commuters without delay by addressing the permit crisis as proposed by the solution document circulated by the anc ; and
multiparty democracy requires a dynamic process of communication in which citizens are informed of decisions that may affect their lives , and mps and mpps engage in a process whereby the needs and challenges of the people are heard and possible solutions are discussed .
i want to bring to the attention of the house the fact that the people of khayelitsha , guguletu and nyanga have spent almost a month now battling all by themselves to survive the public transport crisis , without the involvement of the provincial government .
we know him as someone who , instead of actually trying to seek solutions as the hon minister of transport and works does , seeks every opportunity to create , firstly , conflict with the national government , and , secondly , more confusion on the ground .
the hon minister of education should consider whether she feels proud of a party that ended the government of unity in this province which was able to deal with the fundamental issues because the members of that government actually came from those communities .
that the house expresses its sympathy with the victims of the floods in the northern provinces and requests the national government to do everything possible without delay to render assistance , and further thanks the creator for relief in many areas after years of torrid drought .
we also know that in the communities in the western cape there is massive disillusionment , not simply with politics , but especially with the new np , because of years and years of negative campaign tactics against the national government , such as " swartgevaar " and " blame and complain " .
madam chairperson , in the light of the hon minister 's reply that , in fact , the money was returned , could we get an explanation of how that money was returned to the department , from which vote it comes and when we are going to be apprised of these facts ?
i am now going to rule that at the end of this discussion we will check how many questions have been addressed to the hon minister of finance and development planning and , together with the speaker , i will make a ruling on the matter at the end of the first schedule .
there is also a rule that if there is uncertainty about a vote , which the hon member mr isaacs is now raising , then the chair has the discretion to put it again so that everyone in the house can have clarity about what is going on .
many of us have been here since may 1994 , and the fact that we are still here faithfully and dutifully committing ourselves once again to the work of this province must speak of the enormous love we have for the province , its people and its environment .
if one goes to elsies river secondary school , which the hon leader of the opposition mentioned as a suburb , or to rylands high school and many of our black schools in the townships , one will see that they have pass rates of 80 % and above .
this banner is being displayed against a background of our people 's day to day lives , particularly in the townships and on the cape flats - a life of murder , death , rape and so many other types of crime ; a life of little if any guarantees .
the hon minister of housing received a letter from the national minister of housing requesting him to inform all local authorities not to proceed with the auction of rdp houses , yet he is allowing that to happen in da local authorities .
on the occasion of the redelinghuys incident to which the hon member mr dugmore referred briefly , the anc once again was outstanding in inciting people with half truths , with the help of the media as well , and once again conveying a negative image of agriculture .
mr speaker , what i find saddening is that the day after those people are gone - and because the da council took a decision on the matter and the da council member gave them food that evening and they were transported to worcester on da vehicles ...
mr speaker , we can debate eloquently around the causes - and i agree with the hon member mr louis that the causes are primarily economic and regulatory - but i think that what is warranted is a very serious investigation into the regulatory system .
on the one hand the hon member mr ramatlakane said at the start of his speech that the matter should not be politicised , but then on the other hand he said that the matter could only enjoy a political solution .
] tragically , like so much other crime in this country , mr speaker , while people are dying , hon members on the other side say they are serious about crime , but i would like to know in what way they are serious about crime .
in view of what we have said in the house today , namely that we must take politics out of transport , i cannot - and i think my colleague accepted it in the spirit in which i said it to him - now drag political parties into the matter .
mr speaker , when i listen to the enthusiasm of the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism about the bill and the convention centre , i am astonished that the anc has abstained from voting while we have been engaged in a debate on the bill .
the majority in the standing committee denied that committee the opportunity to scrutinise not only the legislation but also the shareholders ' agreement on which the legislation is based and which the legislation , in actual fact , seeks to authorise and to ratify retrospectively .
conference centres of format are , for example , the popes palace international congress centre origin in france ; dublin castle conference centre in ireland ; palacio de bolsa porto in portugal ; and the mediterranean conference centre valetta in malta , are but a few which readily come to mind .
there were no negotiations , no discussions on where we were going with it - we do not know the details , but i am making this allegation based on a lack of information at the standing committee level , because they did not want it .
mr speaker , look there - the hon minister 's members and his colleagues in the cabinet are so afraid of the next election that the ministers are spending time reading what they will get by way of pension if they have to resign from the house .
we also wish to pay tribute to judge president e l king , to whom derogatory references were made in the house as if the hon premier had drunk tea with judge president king and had lunch with him in the period before the case relating to mr abe williams .
let us listen - and i do this with all due respect because i am also a lawyer - to the words of the late chief justice mahomed , speaking at the first orientation course for new judges in 1997 said , and i quote :
mr speaker , at best " justice " is a complex concept , and the word conjures up the thought of judges and magistrates sitting on the bench and in chambers taking decisions over others , and pronouncing verdicts based on the facts before them .
mr speaker , our position is , firstly , we respect the independence of the judiciary - and everyone knows that we accepted the judgment regarding dr allan boesak - and , secondly , we all know that his appeal to the constitutional court is pending .
i had thought we would speak about the motion , but when i saw today , the anc and the dp were sitting - and we must state clearly that the new np is not the dp and the dp is not the new np ...
mr speaker , two of my colleagues have spoken about the numerous complaints that the anc received after speaking publicly about the issue of allegations of racism in banking , and the skewed access that different people have to the banking sector .
the black partner has , firstly , to pay the white partner a management fee for having done that and , secondly , give him / her a stake in the business , even if the black partner has already secured a tender or a contract .
we said on behalf of this government , and our cabinet approved it , that we would put down r200 000 to get it started - for start-up costs - and then we would put down everything we had available , which was r1 million in capital .
1.1 the committee heard and considered evidence in respect of numerous instances where departments have incurred expenditure for the supply of goods and services without complying with tender board directives and other procurement prescriptions and / or without any communication between the departments and the tender board .
that the house notes with displeasure the increase in incidents of misbehaviour , violence and drunkenness at club rugby matches in the boland , and urgently calls on the governing body of boland rugby to act relentlessly against thugs and the guilty clubs .
madam speaker , before beginning my speech i think it would be appropriate to call for a minute of silence to pay our respects to the family , friends and colleagues of the marais family who were cruelly murdered in the citrusdal district on 8 august 2000 .
that is how i wish to present it to the hon minister , his actions , or lack of them , register to some extent the difference in that the sounds he makes are heard when farmers are attacked , and quite correctly so , but when a farm worker is harmed , he simply goes underground .
that the house condemns the eviction of 44 people , of which one is an elderly woman in a wheelchair , from the farm groenliga in the noorder-paarl area , and calls upon the national minister for agriculture and land affairs to introduce more stringent legislation regarding eviction .
the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism goes on air and denies that he has private interests in any business of any kind in the hotel and tourism industry , but he goes on to admit that , in fact , all his business interests have now been placed in a family trust .
we are saying that the hon premier should choose any of his other ministers , but he should not put someone in charge who raises our suspicions , and then heightens them because there are very deliberate untruths as part of his defence in the issue .
however , at such a meeting one is treated with respect , one 's opinions are considered and one is also able to mix with the national cabinet ministers during the breaks and share experiences - and , i may say , differences - in an atmosphere without unpleasantness and without rancour .
i am very glad that the hon leader of the opposition , if i can call them an opposition , has actually raised this matter , because i now want to move on to the accusation of a breach of section 136 ( 2 ) ( b ) of the constitution .
this is typical of the local government strategy of the anc that is intended , at least , to partially distract attention from the continuing economic inequalities which the government has failed to ameliorate through effective delivery and positive economic performance .
this is not a break with the legacy of nelson mandela but , i would argue , a logical advance in the face of " fight back " ingratitude led particularly by the dp and now generally by the da .
mr speaker , it is specifically on account of there having been expenditure authorised under section 25 ( 1 ) that i am required , pursuant to section 25 ( 6 ) , to include such authorisation in appropriation legislation which must be tabled before this parliament within 120 days .
( 1 ) distances itself from the william cooper document distributed by the national minister of health which inter alia propagates a conspiracy theory speculating that the hiv / aids virus was introduced into africa in a smallpox vaccine to reduce the african population ; and
today i want to thank the cabinet , the hon premier and the hon ministers for having at least shown in the house yesterday that we are honest and when they do not have an answer , they provide it to hon members within the shortest possible time .
we truly believe that the decision of the executive was irresponsible , it will cost the taxpayers a lot of money and it could cause the risk that every decision that is taken at the executive ab initio will be regarded as ultra vires .
however , at this stage i wish to give prior notice that it is my intention to indicate to the house and the people of this province how i intend dealing with matters raised in the opening address of the hon premier .
sir , speak to any card-carrying anc member today and one will see little of the enthusiasm or blind loyalty that was so evident in the nelson mandela years ; speak to any anc member and one will be amazed by their willingness to bad-mouth their own party structures and policies .
the vision of the hon premier of a safe and prosperous province in which no one is left behind and where every citizen has access to the opportunity to improve the quality of his or her life , must be supported by all political parties in the house .
mr speaker , once again i am happy to make the announcement about the 19 municipalities that received r1,3 million for sports projects and the hon minister of transport , sport and recreation must once again be thanked for allocating these much needed funds .
mr speaker , the point you made actually seemed to me to be saying that if the hon member mr fransman intended to mention an example of a negative thing that had happened , but it had not in fact happened , that was an untruth .
every time someone on this side of the house sits down , we hear how he should feel guilty , must say he is sorry and offer all sorts of apologies because he is white , because he is a member of the nnp or for where he was during the struggle .
i want to appeal to all our people in the province and in the country to leave the bitterness of the past behind us , as the hon premier requested , and to use the past , without any bitterness , to build a better future .
yes , when one reflects on our south african history , which meanders through three centuries , one has to admit that during that history people from all sectors back-tracked , side-tracked , acted in an unacceptable manner or did terrible things , and it involved all role-players .
it does not mean that they have to become lap-dogs ; it does not mean that they must support the anc ; it means fighting for national consensus and trying to take forward a vision that was put together in very difficult circumstances before 1994 .
if muslims choose to go to herzlia high school i will strongly support them , but if our school clinics are referring muslim learners to herzlia high school they must find out how strongly they regard their religious affiliations and they must do the same with jewish or christian learners .
however , after listening to the hon leader of the opposition yesterday pontificate about his party 's caring attitude for the poor , it made me think of a very recent example where the anc government has been the direct cause of poverty in the province .
the problem i have with the anc , however , and especially with the hon leader of the opposition , is that they believe that , having travelled to pretoria , they have patented or copyrighted certain national problems and that they alone have the solutions .
given the overall phased-in fall in the national equitable share to the province , and the resultant crowding out of spending on infrastructure , focused steps need to be taken to enhance provincial own revenue to , in the main , augment spending on the economic services sector .
some 50 tents received from japan to serve as temporary shelters for the victims of the recent tornado disaster in manenberg will be routed through the red cross to the worst struck areas in mpumalanga and the northern province .
during the last week , under the leadership of the hon member mr ismail , a spirit was built up in the committee that brought us together and we looked at what are the best interests of the taxpayers in the province with regard to the budgeting process .
now , after analysing the latest report of the katz commission , which was appointed by the national minister of finance , on a possible policy recommendation with regard to provincial taxation , we believe that we have come up with a method of generating extra revenue for the province .
i agree with the hon minister that any act in any industry - be it the fishing industry or any other industry - where there are entrants who enter by way of corruption , should be condemned and reversed , wherever it may be .
madam chairperson , with a common will to reach a common goal , with my twenty-twenty vision which is already taking shape and starting to work , let us make this the most desirable place to live in , to do business in , to work in and to visit .
there is every reason to support the notion of the western cape competing on the international stage as a province in its own right - concluding agreements within the bounds of provincial and national parameters and promoting itself for foreign investment and tourism .
that the house expresses its shock , disbelief and horror at the recent incident in mitchells plain where a young pregnant woman , tasmiedah ganief , was attacked , and her unborn baby removed from her stomach , and further wishes her and her son , tyreeq , strength and a speedy recovery .
looking at the issue of standing committees and support in standing committees , i want to state categorically that i believe that if we want matters to receive their fair share of attention in this house , every standing committee should have its own committee coordinator .
before i elaborate upon that , i would like to mention that it was allocated under vote 1 : premier , but i do not mean to stand up here today and say that this is the hon premier 's responsibility , and then have us reply to the question again in two weeks ' time .
( 2 ) whether the department has a list of provisions and guarantees that will ensure the effectiveness and continuous monitoring of the rehabilitation ; if so , are any conditions attached to this provision in order to allow for re-arrests in case of failure of the rehabilitation ;
the responsibility to allocate a zoning to a portion of land therefore rests with council , and this provincial government can only get involved if such a decision of council is disputed by way of an appeal in terms of section 44 of the land use planning ordinance .
however , the minister may delegate any of his powers under section 2 ( 1 ) of the western cape cultural commission and cultural councils act to an official with at least the rank of director in the service of the provincial administration : western cape in terms of section 23 of the act .
it should be mentioned - and i would suggest that the interpellator listens - that the provincial minister was never a respondent in the interdict proceedings , but the national minister of safety and security , and the undertaking was thus given on behalf of the national minister .
i am referring to the thabo mabaso incident which i also discussed earlier in the house , where the hon minister did certain things , and also his actions after the experience of the hon minister of education at the guguletu police station .
mr speaker , we are in a difficult position because i have a number of questions i want to ask , but i want to ask the appropriate minister and i do not know if the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation is going to be able to answer them .
the public needs to know that it is a scam , and we should actually put pressure on the cabinet to change their plan called transformation 2000 and pump in that r16 million at the level of service delivery where it is sorely needed .
( 1 ) whether the former minister of community safety , sport and recreation has given any reasons , whether verbal or written , for his sudden retirement ; if so , ( a ) what were the reasons and ( b ) whether he will make a statement on the matter ;
] that is exactly what is happening , and that is why the managing director of a very prominent company came to speak to me and said he wants to make a major donation to the schools in lambert 's bay and asked what we could propose .
it should be borne in mind that while the special legalisation process ( slp ) was being implemented , the western cape had requested that the national department of transport relax the criteria for the slp in order to make it more inclusive .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs what steps are being taken to speed up the approval of these applications , given that in march 2000 the hon minister told the house that 370 applications were still outstanding at that time .
whether there are any measures in place to address the safety of people travelling by train from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 between cape town and paarl , especially the safety of students from the cape town college who use this train daily on weekdays ?
could the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism indicate whether , if it is found that some of the criteria were not fulfilled by the current tenderer fnb , and that the bank had in fact shut down its entire smme desk , he would have a re-think on the matter ?
however , i do want to add that in the nature of such a vast enterprise as the matriculation examination - which is the biggest single annual initiative undertaken by the province - it is inevitable that at some time human error can slip in .
they did their creative writing examination yesterday afternoon and the incident is regarded as not having impacted on examination security , but i did think it was important - because it is human error - to report it to the house .
i am happy to say , mr speaker , that this practice has been brought to an end , but must also report that consequently the province now has to pay these amounts during this financial year and not the next ; hence the variation from the 2000-01 budget .
mr speaker , on a point of order : if we judge from the order paper , in contrast to the earlier order paper issued this morning , must we then understand that the anc has withdrawn both the motion to have a secret ballot and the motion of no confidence ?
( 1 ) what has been the outcome of the investigation into a development at grotto bay , as promised by him in a letter dated 23 november 1998 to a certain person whose name has been furnished to his department for the purpose of his reply ; and
this province has the potential to generate income and jobs for all , but economic delivery from a national perspective is suffering from an ill thought through division of south africa into nine powerless provinces with an equally ill thought through allocation of new resources , roles and responsibilities .
madam chairperson , we are pleased to experience this reality of the wind of change because , for the past five years , the anc has kept making the points made by the hon minister of finance and development planning in his speech today .
madam chairperson , as far as this vote is concerned , permit me the opportunity to convey my thanks to the officials in the department , in particular for the way in which they took us through the exercise in scof and in the relevant standing committee .
mr chairperson , if one weighs the demands made by community safety in the province against the availability of r12,48 million out of a budget of r11 billion , one can only have praise for the way in which this minimal amount is utilised in regard to community safety in the province .
madam chairperson , when i salute the hon minister and his department for this initiative it is because i know from experience that compulsory school attendance in the disadvantaged communities was not really successful despite the school attendance officials who were appointed , or who had to be appointed .
when we discussed it before with sapu , popcru and the other police unions , all of them said that they have had no discussions with the hon minister and the hon minister had no discussions with them , even the community police officers .
if he knows what an unfortunate situation the police in this province find themselves in in performing their basic task , such as the tension currently endured by police families and the increasing tendencies towards suicide among them as a result of the stress they endure , he would not shake his head .
president mbeki 's belief that the 21st century must be the " african century " is underpinned by his doctrine of the african renaissance by which he aims to rid the continent of internecine strife and the attendant ills of corruption fuelled by undemocratic practices .
we have put a great deal of work into this , and here i must make special mention of my colleagues ms linda rose and mr dennis pillay who have worked so hard in establishing clear , measurable benchmarks and turning them into indicators of good practice .
we will introduce additional benchmarks during the year ahead , particularly the random stratified sampling at the end of grade 3 to assess whether our pupils are attaining the required reading skills ; if not , why not , and work out what to do about it .
mr chairperson , another major challenge in the year ahead is to develop a coherent plan to ensure that all teachers get the 80 hours of in-service training outside of school hours that they should get in terms of an agreement in the education labour relations council .
the department also spent r4 million on school extensions , particularly at skurweberg secondary school and almost r1 million on relocating mobile classrooms to areas of greatest need , bringing the total in our capital programme to r50 million .
mr chairperson , in the second phase of this project , which has just started , installations will be done in at least 400 more schools bringing the total number of schools with internet connections to more than 1 000 out of a potential of 1 640 schools .
by linking these schools to the telecommunications project and the safe schools programme , the value of the allocation to each of these schools has been significantly increased , and we are now in the process of establishing a joint administrative and educational computer network in each of these schools .
too much emphasis has been placed on the physical facilities which , although they are important and of great value , do not reflect the real problem because the socio-economic circumstances in fact determine whether a parent is capable of contributing towards school funds .
in so far as the latter strategy is concerned , i will be approaching cabinet with the intention of constituting in line with all other provinces a provincial aids council along the same lines as those at national level , but this council will be non-partisan and will include relevant experts in the field .
anyone who has even vaguely considered that closing one of these hospitals could solve our problems has clearly never visited these emergency units at the end of the month on saturday night between midnight and two o ' clock in the morning .
up until relatively recently , the issue of hiv / aids was dealt with in an uncoordinated manner which resulted from tunnel vision and was based largely on the erroneous assumption that hiv / aids was a matter of health , and therefore best left to the health department and health authorities .
mr chairperson , this land is held by the government for the people and until we have identified such land , we should not allow a few greedy people to sell off the family silver while our people need land for housing .
i will fulfil my constitutional duty by supporting municipalities which do not have the necessary financial and management capacity , but where such support does not render the desired results , i will not hesitate to invoke the provisions of section 139 of the constitution .
the cabinet approved the sica report last april , and we are in the process of implementing its recommendations , which have resulted in a number of changes to the structure of the chief directorate , including the reduction of its existing establishment from 157 to 109 posts .
in order to facilitate the implementation of this act and to build the necessary capacity among local authorities in the province , training sessions are being conducted in all the district council areas to familiarise municipal councillors and officials with the principles and provisions of this important legislation and its regulations .
this committee , which consists of representatives from all provincial departments and was established in october last year , has already identified the need to compile a provincial information policy to address the use , distribution and provision of information within and amongst all provincial departments .
i want to thank his officials and the members of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling for the fact that we were able to create this historic occasion , where for the first time in the history of the parliaments of south africa a budget could be passed without any party opposing it .
the point that my colleague the hon member mr louis raised was that if we sit on either side of the house and bring politics into planning matters - and this is where i agree with him entirely - we are not going to get the right results .
indeed , the constitution explicitly states in section 30 that " ( e ) veryone has the right to use the language and to participate in the cultural life of their choice " , which must ultimately be the mandate of the language committee .
instead of having separate entities , such as at present , we can perhaps go back to the old capab system where these are managed by one company and funders or donors can support one company , instead of giving donations to the orchestra , ballet and opera separately .
contracts for the following joint undertakings with financial assistance to other interested parties are currently being prepared for advertisement : the stellenbosch main through route , at an estimated cost of r15 million , of which the province will contribute 40 % ; and the saldanha road over the railway bridge , at an estimated cost of r14,7 million .
contrary to popular belief , i believe that doing nothing as an alternative can easily cost more when the cost of traffic congestion , parking provision , traffic management , environmental degradation and loss of income from tourism are taken into consideration .
the communities of clanwilliam , lutzville , thembalethu , murraysburg , stellenbosch , khayelitsha , heidelberg , vermaaklikheid , leeu-gamka , ocean view , langa , prince albert , knysna , hopefield , malmesbury , bloekombos , wuppertal , casablanca , witsand , melkhoutfontein , herbertsdale , imizamo yethu , klaarstroom , lwandle , porterville and many unmentioned communities sent a message to us .
those of us who have travelled on the n1 lately would have seen one of these projects in progress at the century city off-ramp , where the department has entered into a public / private partnership to upgrade the on-ramps and off-ramps from the freeway .
sir , today i should like to make an appeal to the hon minister of transport and works and the officials of his department to give speedy attention to the voting of funds for the final rounding-off of the upgrading of the road between george and the uniondale-oudtshoorn off-ramp .
because individual businesses , particularly smaller businesses , usually simply do not have the capacity and experience to monitor development in the world economy , regional governments in particular have had to accept the responsibility of monitoring world trends and assisting their local businesses in dealing with those dramatic and rapid changes .
the department of community safety , sport and recreation estimates - and hon members should please listen to this - that between 60 % and 70 % of interpersonal violent crime , such as assault , murder and attempted murder in this province are committed in the close proximity of an illegal liquor outlet .
nisa is a voluntary system that will - and i hope the hon minister of finance and development planning is listening - enable farmers to establish a fund by depositing after-tax income during good years in order to provide for withdrawals during poor years .
i am opposed to people being abused , unfairly losing their jobs and being humiliated , but the anc will have to realise that there are many factors that will determine whether a farmer will still have a financially successful enterprise on his farm the next day .
we told him that agriculture was prepared to help finalise land claims , and in response to that he said to me , " i cannot believe that i am going to get help from this source from which i never thought i would get help .
the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling , having considered the subject of the western cape direct charges bill [ b6-2000 ] , referred to it , begs to report that it has concluded its deliberation on the bill .
president mbeki 's belief that the 21st century must be the " african century " is underpinned by his doctrine of the african renaissance by which he aims to rid the continent of internecine strife and the attendant ills of corruption fuelled by undemocratic practices .
the hon minister of education should say here today what they are doing to ensure that consideration is being given to the role played by schools in areas of this kind so that we can begin to make an impact on the lives of the young men there .
accordingly everyone to whom our newly found democracy is important should not slumber or sleep while the cape is burning , while a mother has to wipe away tears of sorrow , while a father has to quietly mourn , or while a young child has to ask , " where is mother ?
does it also mean that the udm , who are chairing the standing committee on public accounts , believe they cannot blow life into a dying party , so that the udm , that is , the chairperson of scopa , has nothing to say on the matter ?
madam chairperson , while members of this house were with protesters across the road during the opening of this parliament yesterday - that alone is a scandal , but nevertheless - the second meeting to bring about an integrated school at lambert 's bay was going on .
i regard myself as extremely privileged to have become part of the cabinet who will continue to make the western cape what it is best known for in the country - one of the best places to do business and live in .
lastly , mr speaker , i would like to thank the hon leader of the opposition for providing the infrastructure in the michael mapongwuana hospital and for taking the risk of introducing the azt programme when he was still the minister of health .
mr speaker , in reply to the hon premier 's opening address of yesterday , i wish to begin by bringing greetings and best wishes to the hon members of the house , the hon ministers and their departments for a prosperous and meaningful year filled with delivery to all our people .
of course , the hon premier will never be able to make a speech that covers all the issues that we would like him to cover , but i believe that he has made a statement without really understanding the full context of this province and the city .
my immediate conclusion is yes , the hon premier is prepared to commit thousands of pregnant women , their unborn babies and their families to preventative treatment using azt and nevirapine , when the long-term scientific profile of nevirapine and azt has not been well-established .
that the house congratulates the hon member ms essop on her unanimous re-election as the chairperson of the national association of public accounts committees , and further commends her for her role in ensuring a successful conference of the association held in cape town last week .
we in the dp join with other hon members in expressing our very sincere condolences not only to those who have lost family members , but also to the people whose lives are , at the very least , seriously inconvenienced by the developments of the past week .
it may be interesting for the house to note that whereas the hotel on the site in durban , the hilton , was initially fairly unsuccessful financially , it is now much more successful after the restructuring of management , and financial management particularly .
when this issue was raised with the hon minister in the standing committee - and it was raised in the sense that it was asked if the province has , in the first instance , the authority to issue guarantees - his answer to that was quite remarkable .
it is important to note that when direct and indirect effects are taken into consideration , the meetings and exhibitions sector in australia accounted for 1,5 % of all persons employed and a considerable 1,2 % of gdp at factor cost .
in fact , there were about 112 in the early 1990s - 1991 , 1992 - and there were 234 over the 1997-98 period , lifting that country to the position of most favoured destination for international meetings in the asia pacific region , even ahead of japan .
i do not want to become involved in the emotional discussion about the anc opposing the convention centre , which is a red herring and absolute nonsense , but the anc was opposed to the way that the legislation was dealt with in the standing committee , the timing ...
we want to give a mandate to our directors , whom we in the house are authorising to be directors , in their position on the board of the shareholders company to try as far as possible to ensure the implementation of affirmative action principles .
the above-mentioned treasury reply indicated that the matter in which allegedly misappropriated rdp monies to the amount of r161 000 at the ladismith municipality had been referred to the chief directorate : legal services during august 1999 for the appointment of an advocate to investigate the matter .
from evidence submitted , it emerged that any delay in initiating an investigation of fraud or other irregularity in the handling of public funds may result in irrecoverability of the relevant funds and a subsequent loss .
mr speaker , municipalities are regarded as the cornerstone of modern democratic systems - local government brings decision-making on matters affecting their daily lives closer to the inhabitants of every city or town , and affords them the opportunity to become directly involved in decision-making .
i refer , for instance , to gilbert marcus in an article in the journal , lawyers for human rights bulletin , no 3 of 1984 , entitled , " the anc and the awb " , where he draws a comparison between sentencing of an anc member and awb members for the possession of arms .
] we will not let south africa go the way of zimbabwe , which is where the anc and their allies want to take us - through total power and abusive race politics , as we have just heard in the speech of the hon member mr mckenzie .
we believe that the role the new np can play is to bring coloureds into the nation in strong alliances , according to a strong transformation agenda , to bring into synergy the aspirations of the coloured poor and the african poor .
mr speaker , one of these challenges is overcoming the mindset still prevalent in our banking institutions that black business equals high-risk and it will therefore not be supported to the extent that white business is supported .
secondly , we have to turn the allegations into formal complaints and , thirdly , to present them as case studies and establish for ourselves whether a prima facie case exists in order to move towards the human rights commission process - and i think we are moving towards the formal submissions .
zelda jongbloed in her column in kaap rapport , under the title " roei rassisme by geldelike instellings uit " , says in dealing with this issue - i think it is a very eloquent reply to someone like dene smuts - and i quote :
2.5 the following explanatory notes were also taken up in the minutes of the tender board : " further , in terms of sec.5 ( 2 ) of the law ( law 8 of 1994 ) it can be argued that ex post facto approval is not relevant in these circumstances .
however , the difference now is that whereas the ordinance allowed municipalities to make a special levy and levy a special rate in a portion of a municipality , that provision was never used by councils controlled by the np or the dp .
the reality is that the poster campaign of the dp - and we must be very clear that it is the poster campaign of the dp - is based on lies and misinformation , and it is the dp who have created this fear and suspicion amongst a lot of ratepayers .
madam speaker , it is pointless our having a source of revenue when that source of revenue simply has to grow and grow every year and we do not look at other sources , we do not look at expenditure and we do not look at out credit control .
4.1 the proposed amendments to schedule ii are intended to provide clarity by specifying that all fees set out therein are exclusive of value added tax ( " vat " ) , and amending the fee structures to reflect this .
( 1 ) distances itself from the william cooper document distributed by the national minister of health , which inter alia propagates a conspiracy theory speculating that the hiv / aids virus was introduced into africa in a smallpox vaccine to reduce the african population ; and
besides the fact that this argument is fallacious and dangerous , it is also one which , through its demand for a response from the anc , can communicate a message to an insecure and fearful community that we are not united in our fight against urban terror .
today we ask the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works to be prepared to ask organised agriculture in the western cape to suspend the person , if he is a member , from the organisation until such time as the court case has been concluded .
it was also noted that there were strong indications that such additional remuneration and / or fringe benefits should be regarded as unauthorised expenditure in terms of section 10g ( 2 ) ( j ) ( ii ) and ( iii ) of the local government transition act , 1993 .
in the schedule of transitional provisions , paragraph 3 , the following should be added : " the transfer of employees to the nhls from provincial and state laboratories must be in terms of section 41 of the public service act 1994 and section 197 of the labour relations act " .
for those who received the correspondence and those who have read it , it must be very clear that while the issue that there might be compensation was initially raised in the meeting of directors-general , there was a very quick response from the national government in this regard .
this amount includes allocations for the enhancement of financial management in education , r15,168 million ; hospital rehabilitation , r19,138 million ; financial assistance and management support programmes for local authorities , r13,550 million ; the financial management of social security systems , r3,405 million ; improvement of conditions of service for temporary teachers , r5,696 million ; and r1,757 million for land development objectives .
mr speaker , the south african public are ready for political leaders who are community leaders and not polarisers , public servants who practise the art of bringing diverse people together for projects of common good , instead of power brokers who represent only those who have the most clout .
however , it is about time the leaders in the country stood up and encouraged our children to be pioneers and entrepreneurs , and taught them that it is actually not bad to say that it is good to be rich .
if we take the point of the hon member mr louis that the da is responsible for the casinos in this province and what goes wrong , then ipso facto one has to turn around and blame the anc in other provinces for the casinos there .
the newly appointed station commissioner in khayelitsha discovered that senior officials , appointed by the hon premier while he was the minister of community safety - i am sorry he is not here - and by his successors , lack the discipline and commitment to be law enforcement officers .
so , mr speaker , when i hear the hon leader of the opposition suggesting that this government does not care about the poor , i can only assume that he is being a propagandist and not the serious politician he called on all of us to be .
the hon premier thinks so much of the opinion of the poor , the poverty stricken , in the province that he did not even use the notes given him by the former minister of social services and poverty relief in his opening address .
madam speaker , i am not known for often quoting that great communicator ronald reagan , but i was tempted to do so the other day when my son asked me what he could go dressed as to a fancy-dress party .
mr speaker , in the minutes that are available to me today , i would like to challenge every member of the new np to reflect very seriously on what the hon premier said in his opening address last week about the state of the coalition government .
mr speaker , instead of trying to be part of building national consensus the dp -who are the current partners in the coalition government - chose to attack president mbeki for quoting the racist remarks of an engineer .
my question to them is : is it better for a party to participate with the anc in the upliftment of the country , or is it better for that party to put itself in a corner and say that it should only play an opposition role ?
i truly think that the time has come for us to go to the rural areas , recruit brilliant aspiring candidates from among the disadvantaged communities , train them - even if we have to take them across the world - and bring them back to the rural areas to work there and stimulate the economy there .
the hon premier himself cannot even say how the money was utilised , that very same money , but now he tries to motivate our giving another blank cheque of r5,5 million for the same purpose , while the detail has not even been provided yet .
we do not object to the amount of r5,5 million , but the body that is constitutionally recognised as being responsible for overseeing the election is the iec , so that contribution must be made to the iec , and not to the management of the party .
the funding the province receives in the form of conditional grants is to support compliance with national norms and standards , to compensate for providing services that may extend beyond provincial boundaries , and to enable national priorities to be adequately provided for in subnational budgets .
a further indication of the economic status of children and the extent to which the province 's education system is meeting their needs is that it has been estimated that almost one-third of children ( 32 % ) are in schools where the fees are less than r100 per year .
mr speaker , it is quite clear from the report of the chairperson of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling that the committee was able to come together across party lines and find that a number of departments need to be praised for their good work in the budgeting process .
mr speaker , invariably - and we have seen it in this house in the past few weeks - anyone who exposes or opposes this hypocrisy is denounced as racist and a defender of white privilege , and we will hear it here again today .
she said she has a strategy for the disabled , but we have discovered that that strategy actually came from the department of social services , and it goes back three or four years to when the hon leader of the opposition was the minister of social services .
although one could argue at length about whether the western cape receives its rightful share of the national budget , it is in any event apparent that in future the province will never have enough funds to address the needs of the people of the western cape properly .
however much we believe that they have the constitutional right to certain things , we shall have to convince them that it is in the interests of the province to combine schools like these so that we can utilise to the maximum extent the little money that we have .
i will bring that to the attention of those hon members when they come up with frivolous - if i am allowed to use the word because that hon member seemed to have coined it - reasons why ministers on this side of the house should resign .
with this in mind , i am pleased that the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling has endorsed our proposal that all existing and new cooperation agreements between the western cape and other regional governments , nationally and internationally , should be monitored by a multiparty international relations subcommittee of this parliament .
madam chairperson , we are in the infancy of this second parliament of the province of the western cape , and we have seen out the full lifespan of a parliament lasting from 1994 to 1999 , so it is an immense privilege to be able to participate in a debate on our own vote .
it is also again clear that the anc and the members on that side of the house are intent on disrupting the democratic process in the western cape , because they are simply fearful that voters might be registered who will not support that party .
we got down to 346 educators which we felt we could accommodate , but 777 had to be declared in excess this year because of the new age limit that was implemented , the age access limit in grade 1 , and therefore a total of 1 123 are currently on the redeployment list again as at 24 february 2000 .
mr speaker , i do not know what the hon members ' request was , but if there was a request from the standing committee this morning for me to intervene , i give the hon member the assurance that i will give it my fullest attention .
( a ) this means it includes confidential clearance in its present form , which came into effect in 1994 after the first general election , when it was decided to discontinue the extensive clearances that had been used in the past . may i say , this has been a problem .
mr speaker , as a follow-up question , i would like the hon premier to comment on whether he is aware of speculation that many rank and file members of new np believe that he voted for the dp on 2 june last year .
mr speaker , on a point of order : can we request the hon member mr ozinsky to change his format of address to " the hon minister " and not to talk about the " mec ' " , because the senior people in the western cape parliament are cabinet ministers ?
mr speaker , given that the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism has asked me to request him to do so , would he be willing to find out from the current holder of the tender , fnb , whether they have , in fact , shut down their smme desk ?
our understanding was that if that budget item came to the province , the province would not be able to continue to pay the subsidy out of its own budget as the subsidy money for the commuting needs of the province would eat up the budget .
i am glad the hon minister quoted from his own speech in hansard , because i was going to remind him that he promised - and that was in september last year - that in five months there would be a plan on the table .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon minister of health whether it is a practice that if one has limited pharmacy capacity it will determine the intake of patients for the day at a particular day hospital , notwithstanding the number of doctors and nurses present .
union , i am sorry , is the hon minister of transport , sport and recreation not concerned about the many incidents in which that club currently finds itself , and what is he prepared to do to facilitate a harmony in the rugby fraternity with regard to that club ?
the object is to foster cooperation between the provincial government and various other sectors engaged in the fight against hiv / aids , because it is only possible to really make headway against the hiv / aids pandemic if we do so as a nation .
i also want to express my appreciation and thanks to the officials of the departments , and the heads of departments and ministers who accompanied their departments to the scof deliberations over the last few days , and in particular the committee members who handled the deliberations very effectively and efficiently .
the complainant was also informed that in terms of inter alia section 41 ( 1 ) ( g ) of the constitution , 1996 one sphere of government is not allowed to interfere with the " geographical , functional or institutional integrity " of another sphere of government .
( 3 ) whether the tender process was followed with regard to the dispensing of the assets of the ( a ) woodwork rooms , ( b ) needlework rooms , ( c ) computers , ( d ) typewriters and ( e ) any other assets ; if not , what procedures were followed ;
mr speaker , my question is whether the hon minister feels that , for instance , where the people who have houses on the beach destroy the vegetation , a third party should be responsible for rehabilitating their damage , as his department has suggested .
i believe that the measure of our success in attaining these key deliverables was demonstrated in the budget which i presented to this parliament on 28 february and which was the result of many of the initiatives which have been introduced within the treasury in recent years .
when the leader of the anc , the hon leader of the opposition , said , " we own this budget , " it was because that fact was backed up by the information and by knowledge of what the anc had been doing and saying with regard to the budget reprioritisation process .
madam chairperson , on a point of order : i would like to know whether it is correct that only one or two members of the dp are in the house - we saw the same thing yesterday - and not even at least half of their members .
before he came into this house , hon members should have heard how the hon member attacked the gambling process , how he attacked the gambling board , how he attacked " uncle tom cobley and all " involved in the gambling process with the protection of this house ...
when given the golden opportunity to follow up this all important subject just six months later , again at the opening of parliament , the president devoted a scant few sentences to the topic and deferred the matter to his line function ministers for later discussion .
let me proceed with the evidence : recently the minister of education struggled to be served at that same police station ; as is her wont , she made a big fuss and kicked and screamed , and , believe it or not , she immediately gained the attention of the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation .
if the department of community safety can continue with such praiseworthy projects , particularly where structures in the communities can be involved and utilised in preventing crime , we ought ultimately to begin to work towards communities hopefully regaining control over their streets and parks .
as i have to do , and visit the widows of the police who die in the execution of their duties , as many of them also visit victims and families of victims , would they then still think that this is something that we should exploit ?
my logic tells me - i have no grounds on which i can make insinuations - that a child in a school with no sporting facilities or who does not have access to them has very little chance of being included in a school team .
this is a very important time management tool , and i wish publicly to thank the cape argus and sanlam most sincerely for the support they have given to this venture , and mr theo smit for driving its implementation within the department .
our subject advisers are paying regular visits to these schools to offer support and are leading cluster group sessions in the afternoon to build capacity around the setting of internal school examination papers at appropriate standards , assisting with examination preparation and other interventions requested by the teachers .
we need to strengthen the immunisation programmes and to improve their coverage ; to control the spread of the various diseases and to reduce epidemic outbreaks , including immunisation against hepatitis b ; and to develop a strategy to control tb through methods such as improved diagnosis , treatment management , compliance and effective follow-up .
there are only two homes for the aged in that specific area and 269 people are accommodated there ; 19 facilities which provide community services to 1 171 aged and disabled people ; 134 facilities for early childhood development , accommodating 9 751 children ; and only 8 after-school facilities which care for 530 children .
madam chairperson , what we need now is not the appointment of another consultant , and not the development of a business plan that will take three to four or possibly six months to finalise , given the slowness of our bureaucracy .
the institute for housing chose brett merdell from bkis as the provincial housing person of the year and - good news for my good friend the hon member mr dugmore - the municipality of george won the award for provincial local authority of the year .
if this is to be the trend in this house , i will have to request the speaker to act in accordance with rule 50 , and thus make history in the process , so that members are suspended from the house for a specified period without a debate and an amendment .
] there were allegations that there was no clear strategy for putting people into those houses , that the new np councillor there would go all over the western cape and pick up anyone who wanted to stay in a house , no matter whether they qualified or not , and those people would get houses .
yesterday , at the standing committee meeting - and the hon minister attended that meeting - the hon minister of housing correctly stated that mr myburgh , one of our officials , had a programme that showed that a number of municipalities would be totally bankrupt in a few years ' time .
i believe this division stems from the fact that many of his own members are deeply upset at the fact that a party which has only achieved 11 % of the votes has been given four cabinet seats and has control of over 70 % of the budget .
i therefore decided to commence the nomination process afresh , in the hope that i would be able to recommend to the premier a review board which reflects the demography of the western cape and enjoys the confidence of all sectors of our population .
when examining the current operations of the pdc , wesgro , the provincial tourism board and others , we must ask ourselves whether there is an argument for relocating certain of their functions , redefining their roles or even combining their structures into new , more strategically driven bodies .
the policy will serve as a guide to district and local municipalities , farmers and farm workers on how to go about the settlement of farm workers , since the document refers in detail to all aspects to be considered in successfully embarking on a viable settlement project .
madam chairperson , firstly i want to thank the officials of the department - mr africa , mr ellis , mr rabie and others - for the time and effort they put into the presentations they made to the standing committee with regard to this budget .
that delay has led to great uncertainty and unhappiness amongst people in the fish hoek valley area , but i am sure that they will be very happy to hear today that the cabinet has at last come to its senses and that the hon minister has overturned that decision .
whether it is cheaper to outsource than to have this done in the department , i am not sure , but it is a capacity problem and we have to address that , otherwise we shall be losing money when developments do not take place and jobs are not created .
an experiential training programme for students in engineering has been introduced in the department of transport to support the efforts of providing our youth with opportunities to enter the transport industry and ensure that we nurture continuity of our skills to the benefit of provincial transport .
in a four-way partnership between the developer syfin , the cape metropolitan council , the city of tygerberg and the province , ramps are being constructed to access giel basson drive from the n1 in the vicinity of n1 city , with the province contributing only 22,5 % to the total cost .
madam chairperson , the 2000-01 financial year also incorporates the following projects : new surface for the n7 , r15,7 million ; repair of the subway near stanford under main road 267 , r1 million ; safety measures near mossel bay on main road 33 , r3,8 million ; and improvements to the curve at rooihoogte on main road 30 , r0,5 million .
( 2 ) further notes that masakhane and a culture of cooperation be strongly supported , and expresses itself in favour of a policy of credit control which is sensitive enough for the circumstances of people , and will ensure progress and sound management of municipalities ; and
to support the highly cynical conduct of the unions to combat job losses by making it even more difficult for businesses to retrench people , like the national minister of labour has done , will only take us further down this miserable road of less work .
one example is correcting errors of the past which have plunged many communities in the province , as far as property too is concerned , into poverty and deprivation ; the improvement of levels of training and expertise in the province ; and support of voluntary organisations in civil society .
we need to communicate with and educate the people currently suffering under the result of taverns near their homes and that they have the power and the support of the provincial government to put a stop to the unlawful behaviour and abuse .
it is a great pity that she has been accorded no recognition today by the hon minister or any of the others who have spoken for the very good work she has done and the monumental task she has tackled and finalised with great competence , namely the green paper .
if the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation does not continue with the little that he can do for this province with regard to security , people are not going to have the environment that they should have in order to be able to do that .
farmers who use agricultural diesel in the production process and thereby earn income for themselves and their workers and for the agriculture-related workers in the towns , pay the same price per litre of diesel as a person in the town who uses a diesel-powered car or a pick-up truck for pleasure .
that the house expresses its concern that 500 people in piketberg have been waiting since six o ' clock this morning for their pensions , and calls on the acting minister of social services to immediately intervene and to move towards a speedy resolution of the problem of pension payout points .
( 2 ) expresses its appreciation for these continuous efforts by the un to find ways to manage this human disaster of the sub-saharan countries despite the president 's support for dissident theories which , up till now , have only wasted precious resources , energy , time and also south african lives .
in that regard i want to commend the udm for suggesting , together with the anc , that the way we need to deal with this issue is to set clear time-frames and deal with the negotiated process while we use the firm measures .
through ambition and wanting to project herself as a competent minister , she has in fact been part of creating a system of governance in this province which actually does not govern in the interests of the majority , and she bears responsibility for that , together with the dp .
in brief , the hon minister , the new np , the hon minister of education and that bedfellow - that one who fits easily onto a single bed owing to his size , and then still leaves a lot of room - the dp , for them it is a question that they have really had it .
mr speaker , my colleague is correct when he says the state has failed us because the state has shirked its duty and responsibility , whereas the bible teaches us , an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth .
what we are doing in the province at the moment - which central government is not doing at the moment because , as hon members know , they are responsible for the deployment of forces - and i have the statistics of which police stations have what percentage ...
if time had allowed for obtaining proper legal advice prior to incurring the expenditure , i would have exercised the powers vested in me in terms of section 5 ( 3 ) ( b ) and 7 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the western cape exchequer law , 1994 .
we believe that in the interests of transparency , accountability and good governance we are entitled to ask how the hon minister arrived at that figure , how many public servants were paid , what process was followed , where they were deployed to and when were they deployed - amongst other questions .
while the apartheid government in this instance at least followed the process of law , even though it was an unjust law , the anc representative resorts to intimidation and veiled threats relying on fear to prevent his opponents from going about their legitimate business .
one can say that it is going to take a long time to have this kind of economic development in all our communities , but let us use one of the instruments that we do have in our government at the moment , something that we can use to start restoring family life .
he said we would first have a provincial aids council , which would meet later this month , and then there would be consultation as one of its objectives to foster cooperation between the government and various other sectors engaged in the fight against hiv / aids .
in his budget speech on 28 february 2000 - perhaps the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism should listen instead of passing remarks like that - he said that he committed himself to policy goals forming the departure point for provincial allocations .
yes , as far as i am personally concerned , i will take money from whoever is able to assist us , but when i say " whoever " , this has to involve a test , and the test is whether there is an element of quid pro quo or not .
i shall answer him now , because he slaughtered an ox in order to celebrate a victory , but he does not know that the first appellant was the national government , the second the provincial government , the third the cmc and the fourth the oostenberg municipality .
i have said it before and i repeat it to the house : a government that allows people to be killed in the fashion they are in this country and police officers to be killed at a rate of over 200 a year , is guilty of a treasonable offence .
despite the failure of the hon minister to keep his word and stick to his promises , there can be - and i emphasise this - there can be no recourse to violence for any party , especially not the taxi industry .
to accelerate the process for the construction of an international convention centre for cape town , the western cape provincial cabinet , the city of cape town and the cape metropolitan council , along with business cape , formed the cape town international convention centre company - which i will consistently refer to as convenco - in june 1999 .
they delivered a prospectus to us on 4 january this year , which provides such basic information as why cape town should build a convention centre , what the demand profile for such a centre in terms of international markets is , what its configuration should be and how it would perform financially .
sir , when we talk about the international convention market , we are really talking about a tourism sector referred to by the acronym mice , which stands for meetings , incentives , conferences and exhibitions .
( 1 ) that the speaker , deputy speaker and leader of the house be instructed to urgently consult with the executive with a view to finalising the issue of the demarcation of and control over the parliamentary precincts , and specifically the issue of parking facilities ; and
it is a necessary prerequisite for ensuring that independence , to ensure that the judiciary remain accountable to the people of south africa and that they will in the end in their judgments and pronouncements reflect the total spectrum of south africans , and not only that of white south africa .
as soon as the banking industry had had their say and black business were about to speak , the media left , and members of the dp , the new np and even the acdp who had been there in the morning also disappeared from the portfolio committee 's proceedings .
in the second area we have worked since last year with the banking council to get a viable mentorship programme going so that from the moment that the small business applies for finance we assist those from previously disadvantaged communities to prepare their business plans .
2.4 with regard to the request for ex post facto approval , the board resolved on 7 march 2000 not to approve the request as the department had improperly interfered with the board 's decision not to award the tender to the company .
it further recommends that the department should , as a matter of urgency , ensure that in future there is full compliance with the public finance management act , 1999 , and western cape tender board law , 1994 , and that they should henceforth strictly be applied as also recommended in resolution no. 1 above .
as the hon member mr mckenzie has said , the bill will allow the national minister for provincial and local government to set a limit on the amount of the property rate which municipalities may levy and a limit on the annual percentage increase in the property rates .
that an ad hoc select committee be appointed to draft provincial legislation in terms of section 27 of the constitution of the western cape to provide for a code of conduct for the members of the provincial parliament , and that the following members shall constitute the ad hoc select committee , viz :
it is envisaged that the casino at caledon will open its doors on 15 october 2000 , followed in the space of a month by the casino at club mykonos and finally the big one at goodwood called grandwest on 15 december 2000 .
these staff of the board will now be utilised almost exclusively for a most important function , namely to conduct regular audits and inspections of bookmaker and totalisator operations to ensure that the public is protected and that taxes are correctly and promptly paid over to the province .
it is now in question because of his insistence on being there and his not conceding that there is a potential risk because of his family trust owning the victoria & albert hotel in the waterfront and having interests in the waterfront in a number of restaurants and so forth .
suddenly the dp , who could have claimed a few months ago that it was the corruption watchdog , has become a watchdog that first has to look at what its alliance partner is doing before it can say something and there is none of the shrill principle that we have become used to .
mr speaker , as chairperson of the meeting i said that the disclosures were on the table - and i am paraphrasing it , but the minutes will reveal what i said - and i asked if anyone wanted to comment on them or raise any other matter .
mr speaker , i was sworn in as minister of finance on 1 october 1998 and shortly thereafter , on 9 october 1998 - the hon member mr dugmore should take notes - i wrote to the hon premier , disclosing what my business interests were at that time .
the vitriol spewed by those hon members is typical of a directionless opposition who , in my view , should be ashamed of themselves for using what can only be termed " below the belt tactics " and , i repeat , damaging to the convention centre .
mr speaker , i have purposely not referred to the anc 's press statement on 22 august 2000 , as the content is subject to proposed action for defamation in the hands of my attorneys who are dealing with the matter and is about to be dealt with by senior counsel .
( 2 ) notes with concern that mr cooper also claims that president j f kennedy was shot by his driver , that the united states had bases on mars and the moon in 1950 and that there is an underground alien base in new mexico .
in the context that it is personal , one is vulnerable and there is a threat to free political activity , the anc adds its voice to the many others expressing horror and disgust at what has been happening , particularly the incident at the samaj centre .
indeed , mr speaker , the only people in south africa who are using their influence to ensure that pregnant women are getting access to these drugs is a white male minister of health in the western cape , my hon colleague , and a white male member of the pac , dr costa gazi .
( 2 ) notes that with his efforts fishermen and companies will be able to get their vessels out to sea with the commencement of the new catching season , international market deadlines will be met and people will be able to work in the processing plants ;
( 2 ) notes with concern that mr cooper also claims that president j f kennedy was shot by his driver , that the united states had bases on mars and the moon in 1950 and that there is an underground alien base in new mexico .
draft national legislation that assigns an additional function or power to , or imposes any other obligation on a provincial government , must , in a memorandum that must be introduced in parliament with that legislation , give a projection of the financial implications of that function , power or obligation to the province .
if , in the first instance , the national cabinet had carried out its promise and its constitutional job - and they promised to give the correct amount of money to the iec - we would not have had to spend the money .
my next heading is the appropriation of money for the services of the province in respect of which no or insufficient funds have been appropriated in the relevant financial year and which may only be appropriated in respect of expenditure regarded as being unforeseen and unavoidable by the provincial treasury .
we support the venture capital fund , the export promotion drive , with the reservations that i have expressed , the support for small and medium enterprises and the fact that the department of economic affairs have produced green papers , which include many issues which we have raised , for tourism and economic development .
if hon members followed the whole affair on the internet , they will agree with me that it was the most interesting court case in the history of democracy , with a government turning to its own constitutional court to rule on things that that government itself had instituted .
the hon premier also raised the issue of racism in his opening address and argued that there is still the awful reality of racial divisions in our country , and in this context he appealed to everyone in the house to think carefully before making statements .
while it is commendable that the hon premier raised the problem that the aged face regarding abuse , i am fearful that he might only raise the problem that these vulnerable children face only after another carte blanche episode on child abuse may be broadcast .
these people , who are mostly unemployed and in the camps 24 hours per day , could be trained as a vigilante group , taking responsibility for evacuating highly flammable items such as gas stoves and oil stoves while waiting for the fire brigade to arrive .
the most worrying factor in the opening address of the hon premier is that we have been given a shopping list of his so-called achievements , thereby deciding to deliberately deceive the people of the western cape into thinking that the provincial government is better than the national government .
if the hon member mr byneveldt made a brief statement of congratulations to those people who cancelled all their christmas leave and worked overtime to bring about a safe new year for all the tourists and the residents of this province , it would be welcomed .
we applaud these achievements , not because those hon members should be credited with them , but because they underscore the enormous amount of goodwill and the work ethic of a racially polarised population , despite the fact that 42 % of the electorate do not have representation in this government .
they are proudly sold in every major retail outlet overseas , and when i travel to the united states of america or europe it gives me great pleasure to see the " made in south africa " label firmly affixed to its side .
total provincial revenue , comprising total national payments of r10,833 billion plus provincial own revenue of r516,539 million , amounts to r11,350 billion for the 2000-01 financial year , which is a 5,24 % year-on-year increase , of which r45,561 million is to be used for debt redemption , leaving r11,304 billion available for expenditure .
mr speaker , i take pleasure in following the hon member mr ozinsky because i find it interesting that the hon leader of the opposition no longer leads his party 's attack but gets one of his sacp backbenchers to do it for him .
secondly , a joint venture was launched between a spanish company , freiremar , and velamar fishing corporation , whose prominent johannesburg shareholders included - listen to this - princess zenani mandela-dlamini ; former anc mp gertrude shope ; former trc commissioner hlengiwe mkhize ; national sports councillor mvuso mbebe ; national transport commissioner dupree vilakazi ; and gauteng tycoon patrick banda .
that is why the poor from provinces controlled by the hon leader of the opposition 's party - not only from the eastern cape , but also from the free state and any other province - come to the western cape for a chance to improve their lives .
mr speaker , when the vote of the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism is debated , we will talk about his lack of representivity , including the institutions that he has set up in the province over the last six months which are not representative of the province .
mr speaker , after analysing the latest report of the katz commission , which has just come out , we found that it states that the provincial legislatures can impose a levy and that the national government does not need to give us permission to impose that levy .
during the 1999-2000 financial year , the following business plans were developed : an overall business plan for this office , which included the full amount budgeted for projects of r1,664 million , and individual business plans for each desk , indicating the project link to the key deliverables , which amounted to r400 000 for each desk .
at the same time , i will request that the parking required by members and parliamentary staff also be demarcated and placed under our own control , because it was a major oversight that this parliament was provided with office space at the outset , but did not acquire any parking facilities over which we had sole control .
whether any cases of crime involving tourists to the province have been reported between january and december 1999 ; if so , ( a ) how many , ( b ) how many led to arrests , ( c ) how many remain unsolved and ( d ) how many have resulted in successful prosecutions ?
( 1 ) what is the role of the building inspectors in the tender process with specific reference to the ( a ) process , ( b ) timing and ( c ) role of estimates in the final determination of tenders , after the publication of the financial aspects of each tender ;
a meeting was held at the offices of the west coast district council in moorreesburg on 25 january 2000 between representatives of the local authority , cape nature conservation , the department of planning , local government and housing , the homeowners ' association and the developers to discuss the implication of my department 's position .
in the light of the published underspending of the national health budget , whether a portion of this money has since been allocated to the province ; if not , why not ; if so , ( a ) for which programmes / projects and ( b ) how much was allocated per programme / project ?
( 1 ) whether the department of transport and works has statistics available on the high incidence of accidents on the r300 over the past two years ; if so , how many of these accidents were fatal ; if not , whether he is aware of the outcry by the community of west bank ;
no charges were brought against any other person who was with reservist constable van wyk , but they were nevertheless moved from that area by the ccpb - that is the patrol board - and not deployed in the area of contention .
let us be honest - if there is something wrong , they should have the courage of our convictions and address their party , and tell their party that their delaying tactics , whatever they are trying to use , are also contributing to raising the number of deaths and amount of loss .
report card fraud will inevitably have a very negative effect on pass rates , as the learner who has got into a certain grade by using a fraudulent report will probably be ill-prepared to deal with the curriculum at the level required in that grade .
mr speaker , it should not be abused as an opportunity to further foment racial intolerance , as was attempted by the hon leader of the opposition in the house and they should not regard race as a lifeline and attempt to use it to mobilise support .
your ruling in reply to a letter of mine today was that you had no discretion to deviate from the rules and procedures as you understood them and therefore could not accede to a secret ballot on the proposed motion of no confidence .
these are a credible and achievable budget ; the optimal allocation of resources ; an understandable and user-friendly budget ; the maximisation of own-revenue sources ; a fair , equitable , transparent , competitive and cost-effective procurement system ; sound fiscal and financial discipline ; value for money spending ; and increased efficiency and productivity through the use of information technology .
i wish to thank the hon premier , my colleagues in cabinet , members of the provincial treasury committee , the chairperson and members of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling , chairpersons and members of all the other standing committees and department heads and their staff for their continued support and understanding .
this was made possible by the r5 million from the casino bid allocation - which was transferred to the 2000-01 financial year because it was received so late at the end of 1999 - and other funds reprioritised from other projects and programmes to counter the growing police crisis .
that the house , in the light of the recent incident in vredendal where a policeman was charged with murder after he had shot a person in the back of the head in june 1997 , takes note of the anger of the local community and the relatives of the deceased , ... -
mr chairperson , it worries me greatly when i visit schools without adequate learning materials , particularly textbooks , and it is even more worrying to find how inadequate management systems are to secure the return and recycling of these books by pupils entering the next grade .
the prioritisation of primary health care over the past few years has resulted in primary health care attendances increasing by 27 % over the past three years , along with the introduction of free primary health care services and the construction of 52 new primary health care centres over the past three years .
i did not expect that all the mechanisms would be in place already , but i did hope and trust that the legislation that we adopted in the ncop a while ago would at least be in operation by now to show those people that the new np cares .
for two years the hon premier and the hon minister have failed to act on recommendations that were made to this province by consultants who were paid r2 million to advise on the transfer of assets of the provincial housing development board to local governments .
the provincial spin doctors claim they are " the best and getting even better " , but anyone who has read the report of those consultants and understands that absolutely nothing has been done to deal with the shameless state of affairs , would support my call for national intervention .
some started renting them 10 or 15 years ago , and each tenant pays rent according to his / her income . however , they are now letting them out to students at r2 000 , r3 000 or r4 000 per month .
i want to request hon members to see what we are doing here and what we are doing in local government in the context of the reality of where south africa stands at this stage ; and then we can all point fingers at one another here today and say how badly things are going in certain areas .
certain hon members gave me outstanding answers and made a contribution , and others flatly refused to make a positive contribution , but merely responded negatively and , to a large extent , also launched personal attacks - which , in any case , is not the worst thing that could happen .
aspects of the provincial strategic plan have been communicated to all local authorities in the west coast , winelands , central karoo , little karoo , overberg and southern cape regions , and it is envisaged that other local authorities in the province will be brought into this process during the forthcoming two months .
we must know that nearly 75 % of the population of this province live in the metropolitan area of cape town , and at present decisions on planning are being taken in an ad hoc way by a fragmented system of local government without any regard to an overall integrated planning framework for the province .
however , mr chairperson , i wish to state clearly right at the outset that i am sorry that this afternoon , after beginning well , the hon member mr ozinsky thanked the officials and then later on made that unnecessary remark about four ministers who were going to visit valkenberg hospital tomorrow .
another aspect that may be highlighted in the coming year is an aggressive marketing strategy to inform the people of the western cape in even the most disadvantaged areas , geographically , culturally , economically and physically speaking , of the services and subsidies available for cultural services .
" i would understand if they advised him in that way , his officials for whom i have the greatest respect and with whom i cooperated very closely for several years when i was chairperson of the standing committee , and officials whose weekly top management meetings i attended .
in the white book - and i do not know if mr leon fourie is listening - r44 million has been budgeted under health for the upgrading of their facilities , but i know that works has also made provision in their budget for r44 million for the upgrading of health facilities .
while on the subject of road congestion , and knowing that this parliament passed the provincial toll roads bill last year , i would like to know if the hon minister and his department have any intention of utilising this legislation in the near future .
i cannot say to hon members today that there will be a toll-road in chapmans peak , on the n1 or the n2 , but in these provinces we are going to get toll-roads ; otherwise it would not have been necessary to draft an act , because we could have got by without it .
mr speaker , on a point of order , and you may rule as to whether you will deal with this matter now or at a later point : in regard to the motion that i moved , i am concerned that there was a subsequent motion moved by the hon member mr silke , of which the content was the same subject matter .
it is important that we afford the public full protection at all times , particularly the vast majority who make use of public transport , and call to their attention that by means of this legislation we shall intercede for them at all times and act to protect them .
while the anc welcomes this legislation , and also the measures which will allow us to deal with the situation very firmly , it is quite clear that this province must accept a large share of the blame for why we are facing this crisis in the metropole at this point .
i believe that i can make a much more valuable contribution through working with community organisations , because this province clearly has no interest in working with all the people and transforming our society to work against child prostitution , abuse , rape and illegal firearms .
this province bent over backwards to improve the registration rate - and the hon members of the anc will agree with me , with reference to the figures mentioned here by the hon minister of finance and development planning , that this province performed extremely well in the last round , thanks to the involvement of the province .
i wish to state clearly , coldly and clinically that when i decided to come to this house to make a contribution , it was with the intention of making meaningful contributions whenever i rose to speak , be it here or in a meeting of a standing committee ...
mr speaker , on a point of order : i am aware of the fact that in terms of the order paper we are supposed to debate the opening address of the premier , but i do not recall a convention that motions are not allowed on the second day of the debate on that address .
for example , the anc decided to arrange workshops for their local councillors during the first day of the school term , which meant that they wanted various teachers who had been elected as anc councillors to attend workshops , when their duties and responsibilities should have been in the classroom .
when a question on the provincial aids council was put to the hon minister of health , his response was , and i quote from question 2 ( 2 ) ( a ) and ( b ) in hansard : western cape , 17 october 2000 , vol 5 , interpellations , questions and replies , p 503 :
when they came to fetch their wages on friday , they discovered that instead of the r1 per basket of grapes - and that is not a box - that they were going to get , they would only get 65 c and that the farmer had deducted r25 for the shears they used .
the department , for instance , reports that in the southern cape last year - and i want to remind the hon members and the speaker that last year was an election year - 5 290 farm workers received a one-off payment of r400 supposedly to resolve their poverty problems .
this is because the hon minister wanted to impress the house with his vision speech in september 1999 and he made promises on which he did not follow through or he did not succeed in doing what he undertook in the house to do .
at that time , the then provincial cabinet , which hon members will recall consisted of the new np and the anc , agreed that the casino licence for the metropolitan area must , as part of the benefits for the city and the province , produce a world-standard convention centre for cape town .
on 26 october 1999 the gambling board gave permission to convenco to enter into negotiations with the preferred bidder , ie sunwest , to see whether the sunwest proposal could be extended to create a larger and more appropriately sized convention centre for the city .
notwithstanding this , the committee recommends that the amount of r2 961 383,61 be authorised by the provincial parliament and further recommends that proper control be instituted over all inter-departmental communications , especially correspondence between the departments and treasury , including a system of follow-up to ensure that matters receive the necessary attention .
the committee heard and considered evidence with regard to the under-utilisation of permanently allocated vehicles by user departments and acknowledges the implementation of a new daily tariff which is expected to ensure that departments pay appropriate attention in order that utilisation of vehicles is improved .
requests that a temporary moratorium be placed on the transformation and closure of these schools and that the standing committee on education , environmental and cultural affairs be requested , as a matter of urgency , to investigate the whole issue , and report to the house as soon as possible .
the objective is still , as far as the province is concerned , 1 november 2000 to have everything ready and correct for the transformation of local government and , of course , the election that will take place as well as the implementation of the new system of local government in the western cape and in south africa .
as far as category a is concerned , the demarcation board has determined that there must be 1 metropolitan municipality - and it is almost the same as we have at this stage in the metropolitan area - 24 category b municipalities , which are the local municipalities , and 5 category c municipalities , which are the district municipalities .
mr speaker , we have a unique situation in the western cape , not to be found anywhere else that i am aware of in a democratic country , where the head of the department of justice in this province is also a sitting anc councillor on the cape metropolitan council .
( 2 ) calls on all spheres of government to immediately create an environment to sustain smmes , with specific reference to innovative small business legislation , seed capital , support services and demarcation of industrialised rezoned sites , especially in previously disadvantaged areas ; and
in a new industry such as the gambling industry , it is very necessary for us not to accept that the act is cast in concrete , and that the law requires to be changed from time to time and we will continuously make changes in the interests of the industry .
madam speaker , the property rates bill also seeks to establish a clear and defined structure in which differentiations in property rates are rationally linked to the quality of service and type of service , as well as the circumstances - past and present - of the ratepayer .
in one case the corpse of a farmer who was killed at soekmekaar in the northern province was " decorated " with the headlamps and number-plates of his truck to illustrate to the farming community that the attackers were in control and that they could intimidate as they wished .
if the national ministers of safety and security and of defence have not yet reacted to requests by agri sa for urgent discussions about this matter then i make an earnest appeal to the western cape government to assist in getting these discussions under way .
madam speaker , as the hon member mr williams rightly pointed out , as well as the hon member mr fransman , it was the cruel murder of the elderly couple , willem and anna marais of citrusdal , that once again put the spotlight squarely on the attacks on farms and smallholdings .
the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling , having considered the subject of the western cape eighth gambling and racing amendment bill [ b11-2000 ] , referred to it , begs to report that it has concluded its deliberations on the bill .
mr speaker , the anc agreed that i should be part of the task team , because we are prepared to do whatever it takes to deal with the concerns of the residents and the ratepayers and to ensure good governance in the south peninsula .
firstly , after our meeting on 21 june 2000 we resolved to ask the hon premier to find a way for the task team to have sight of a forensic audit into the two departments that had been commissioned by the ceo of the south peninsula municipality .
if this was the hon minister 's motivation for misleading the public , he should say so and acknowledge that it was in fact he who was motivated by a desire to play petty politics and attack personalities , including the hon member ms essop .
a public perception of a conflict of interest could have been allayed by a declaration of interest of all the directors of convenco , which includes the beneficiaries of any trusts that may have financial interests in any concern that could benefit directly or indirectly by the decisions of convenco .
in fact , what lies behind this is that is a strategic decision by that party that they wanted to remove the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism as the chairperson , so that they could control it , gain political benefit out of the project , and so on .
the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling , having considered the subject of the western cape eighth gambling and racing amendment bill [ b11-2000 ] , referred to it , begs to report that it has concluded its deliberations on the bill .
he also finds that the prosecutor , the community , and the defence , the state , are guilty of neglect of duty to the child democracy , and are sentenced for life to feeding the child adequately and assisting and supporting him with all the power at their disposal , namely the police and the defence forces .
this is because the best approach to dealing with urban terror in an open , democratic and constitutional state is to combine harsh and effective measures to isolate and eliminate terrorist cells , their leaders and their logistical support , with encouraging a vigorous political life of public participation , inclusion and debate .
it is not a white president or white minister of health who are pursuing incomprehensible policies on hiv / aids that , when viewed one day from the perspective of history , will be seen as another crime against humanity , because this policy will have genocidal consequences .
branded as the enemy , increasing numbers of white south africans of goodwill and talent , who really want to make a contribution , are coming to the conclusion that there is no future here for them , or their children , in a country governed by a race-obsessed anc .
finally , mr speaker , i want to say that by persistently harping on racism and doing nothing about it , the hon members on that side of the house are subtly occupying people 's brains in the same way that president mugabe occupies people 's land .
that in terms of section 6 ( 3 ) ( b ) of the remuneration of public office bearers act , the upper limit of the salary and allowances of the premier of the province be determined as promulgated by the president of the republic of south africa on 20 september 2000 .
we see no land reform programme , and evictions on a massive scale , racism committed on a scale that recalls the scale on which kindred spirits of hon members on that side of the house committed racism , assaults by farmers and desperate living conditions are the order of the day .
it was also noted that the department acknowledged that the relevant amount had not been properly authorised and therefore considered it unnecessary to submit the matter to the tender board as the circumstances were not seen as an emergency or in the best interest of the state .
compare this to 5 december 2000 , when the anc received 40 % of the votes , an increase on the percentage of 1994 , and the da received 50 % , confirmed by the hon minister of community safety yesterday , which was a decrease of more than 6 % .
if one looks at the analysis , the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism was correct when he said that 40 % - more than a third - of the people in the western cape , the coloureds , are a group that one cannot wish away .
in that edition there is an article entitled " the emergence of new identities in the western cape " and it is written by two academics at stellenbosch , bekker and cornelissen , and two academics from overseas , leild and horstmeier , who are hardly communists and hardly anc supporters .
residents from this suburb are unwilling to accept that newlands is no longer a whites-only area and that , because of apartheid , sports facilities in the townships either do not exist , or the upgrading of the existing facilities is not on the agenda of this government .
the western cape government ensures the delivery of income grants and pensions efficiently and on time , knowing - as our new colleague the hon minister of social services and poverty relief reminded us - that a delay of one day can be a matter of life and death to a pensioner ;
the acdp believes that we should look not only at tax rebates , but , more importantly , also at legislation , as in italy , where children are obliged to make a more active contribution , more than just a financial one , to the welfare of their parents .
in environmental affairs alone r850 000 is to be spent on tourism development along the west coast , r750 000 has been allocated for a similar project at de hoop on the east coast and the western cape nature conservation board will operate independently and be allowed to become an income-generating entity , boosting employment and tourism opportunities .
the anc education mec in the eastern cape claims they did not have the money to pay the subsidies , yet money seems to be no object for this mec when he has to hire a car to travel from johannesburg airport to a meeting in pretoria .
having said that , i would like to inform the house that despite the shortages the police succeeded , in the six weeks of the festive season , in bringing about the most crime-free weekends that we have had in a long time , including in the townships .
" i told him that there were only three people on duty in that particular police station at any one time and they had a broad area to cover , not just that little park which is mainly for the white community in that particular suburb .
we have a fragile democracy that is just six years old , but if we do not nourish it with the necessary respect and national pride , leaving room for differences of political opinion and fostering a determination to make south africa a winning country , with all the sacrifices that that entails , then the danger signs are all too apparent .
it furthermore aims to bring the quality of services delivered into the budget process , to allow for reprioritisation of expenditures towards key areas of need and to hold government accountable for the resources it uses in achieving its outputs .
however , mr speaker , the process of the standing committees remains flawed ; insufficient time is allocated ; and there is still a very bad attitude in certain instances - and the hon member mr ozinsky has referred to the attitude of the hon minister in the office of the premier .
as hon members probably know , and i referred to it in detail in my opening address , our province is receiving considerable technical and other forms of international assistance to establish and run projects mainly aimed at helping the disadvantaged and the poor of this province .
madam chairperson , we are fooling ourselves if we talk about the western cape as the best province with the best matric results , with the best economy , with the best budget and the best resources , while our women and children are still in chains and we close our eyes to their plight .
madam chairperson , the challenge for this government is to create a mechanism and a structure that eliminate forms of discrimination against women , thus enabling women to participate actively in all spheres of public and private life .
i think it was last week that i was told - i address this to the hon minister in the office of the premier - regarding the issue that causes the money to be transferred , that the situation resulted because she did not have a business plan .
while i am dealing with issues affecting members ' pockets , let met say that i also intend soliciting the support of members to consider introducing penalties for allowing cellphones to ring in the chamber and at committee meetings .
today the speaker has , in opening the debate , outlined some measures which , if implemented , i could call real intervention that could put the record straight with regard to the provincial parliament and the role of the provincial parliament versus the cabinet .
the provincial constitution , in section 23 ( 4 ) , in fact enjoins the provincial parliament to confer , through its rules and orders , the necessary powers for committees to oversee the activities of the provincial organs of state and to hold the provincial executive accountable .
whether any computers and computer equipment have been stolen from the western cape provincial administration ; if so , ( a ) how many computers were stolen in the past two years , ( b ) what is the estimated replacement value of these computers and ( c ) what disciplinary steps have been taken to date ?
it was furthermore agreed to between the parties that over the next few months a new contract based on the original tender submission be drawn up between the " successful consortium " and the provincial government which provides clearly for , amongst others , specific deliverables , detailed project management and implementation processes .
like all things that are new , it has had its teething problems , but hopefully , if we get the cooperation of all the role-players that are involved here - and i believe that certain women 's organisations from political parties are also involved - and we all put our heads together , we can get over this hurdle .
( 2 ) no , the visit of miss south africa to edendale primary school on 5 april 2000 was not disclosed to the acting station commissioner at the local saps branch , and therefore no special safety measures or other arrangements were put in place by the saps or organisers of the event .
furthermore , what steps has he taken to investigate allegations against the hon minister in the office of the premier in regard to the administration of idt funds received by the tonka bosman school since the matter was raised in the provincial parliament over five months ago .
mr speaker , i would rather not repeat my reply , but i want to say to the hon member ms phike that i was trying to tell her precisely that there were no grounds for any discrimination , and also to inform her about what channels can be followed if any discrimination does occur .
i would also like to thank the officials led by mr ismay - or is it dr ismay - for their excellent work , and the extent to which they are empowering the mpps to get to grips with the new national legislation , including the public finance management act .
we did get an answer regarding the r5 million of olympic projects , that the interest rates were fixed on the professionals and the building contractors that have not been paid due to the legal battles still being fought over the fulfilment of contracts .
in this regard it should be noted that officials of the directorate : land development management attended a meeting on 25 january 2000 at the offices of the west coast district council , moorreesburg , where outstanding issues were discussed between all relevant role-players , including the complainant and legal representatives of council and the developer .
there is a selfish attitude on the part of the national ministry towards the levying of provincial taxes , which i believe is in line with the anc 's desires to establish control at a central level rather than allow true federalism to flourish .
the challenges faced by our administrators are that they must continue to be abreast of new developments and constantly renew their knowledge and skills so that they may be in a position to give encouragement and assistance to the sportsmen and women at all levels - local , provincial and international .
we are assessing the impact of this intervention , but my information to date is that it did not influence the behaviour of learners who continue to arrive up to 40 days late for the start of term , or regularly arrive at school late in the morning and leave early .
" that is a very serious worry and i certainly hope that the terms of reference of the review committee are broad enough to be able to get to the core of the problem and to be honest about solutions , which will have to be very far-reaching , particularly in the area of learner resource materials or textbooks .
they argue with me on every school visit that we made a big mistake in abolishing corporal punishment , but my view is that we have to find alternative methods of maintaining discipline in classrooms , particularly by encouraging a sense of responsibility among learners , for their own development .
may i take this opportunity to add my voice to the concerns expressed in the media over the past few days regarding the fact that 40 % of the money allocated to the national department of health 's hiv / aids directorate was not spent .
when one starts employing people in a department or areas of delivery that represent the poor and those who have been marginalised in the past , and those from rural areas , one invariably starts orientating those programmes and that department towards the poor .
i find it audacious that the hon minister in the office of the premier can stand up here and say that we are politicising this , ask if we can look the poor people in the eye , and assert that the national government could not spend the money .
although good progress has been made with the construction of houses under the current mechanism contained in the housing subsidy scheme , it could be argued that there was no real basis for determining whether the product delivered was the most cost-effective structure that could have been provided .
another problem with which we are confronted in relation to the housing need is the whole question of squabbles , the waste of time and often the political power-play between provinces and local authorities or municipalities , which often delay housing projects , with the result that the people cannot acquire houses .
mr chairperson , on behalf of the 4 million south africans infected with the virus , i want to thank the hon minister for coming up with initiatives such as the one he announced today , namely to get the cape coons involved in anti-aids activities at their performances .
as long as these twin problems from opposite ends of the socio-economic spectrum are not addressed , it will be impossible to ensure that the environment is not harmful to the health and wellbeing of our people , or to protect the environment for the benefit of present and future generations .
mr speaker , on a point order : i would like it clarified as to whether it is parliamentary for hon members on the other side of the house , when referring to a speaker , to say that he is speaking to the peanut gallery up there .
these withdrawals are , inter alia : before an annual budget is passed ; for deposits or investments in the national revenue fund ; for refunding of money not due to the provincial revenue fund ; for emergency funds ; to fund the withdrawal of exclusions ; and in the utilisation of savings as virements .
as hon members would have noticed from the green paper , we propose to move away from the model contained in the existing western cape tourism act , 1997 ( act 3 of 1997 ) where all functions relating to tourism , from policy-making to marketing and development , are delegated to the western cape tourism board .
we will also fund training to develop the skills for the development of micro-foundries to supply goods ranging from high-precision components to craft products through the lost wax process , in collaboration with , what has been a really good collaboration , peninsula technikon , and local foundries .
should permission be granted to the operator to operate a liquor outlet within a residential area , strict rules need to be adhered to , the most important of these being the enforcement of trading hours , respect of the age limit restrictions and agreeing not to tolerate the sale of illegal substances from the premises .
we go out of our way to help people to obtain property rights in towns ; property from the owners of which will probably be ejected after a very short period after which it will be sold , as is evident from the motion which the hon member mr byneveldt presented here this morning .
the hon member mr ramatlakane referred to the 51 days that it took to get the amendment bill on the table , but he also knows - he was a minister - that a process is started whereby a bill is born , after which it has to go through a specific procedure .
at the end of this month , for the first time in this country , i will be taking 200 neighbourhood watch coordinators from around this province into a residential course of a week and we will conduct the training ourselves , together with the police , at a much reduced price in comparison with the previous costs .
madam chairperson , i refer the hon minister of health to the time when he had to apply his mind to the question of releasing the r526 000 , and to the fact that the adjustment appropriation we have today , of which this schedule is a part , was presented to us in november 1999 .
what i find amazing , and i would like to ask the hon minister about this , is how they knew that they were going to have savings at the end of the 1999-2000 financial year to the amount of r1,6 million and therefore guarantee the department of education in advance that they would be reimbursed ?
i have requested the police over the past few weeks to identify those two or three areas in this city that are most deeply affected by gangs - not to define those areas by suburb but by the influence spheres of the particular gangs .
mr speaker , i rise with pleasure at the start of a new year to thank all of those whose efforts contributed to progress in education during 2000 and the opening of schools in this province on 22 and 23 january 2001 .
i have in turn tried in vain to persuade this anc councillor to do his democratic duty and meet his concerned constituents so that development can proceed on a sound footing , but he simply refuses to sit across the table from anyone who disagrees with him .
the best thing about having the western cape in da hands - both the unicity and the provincial government - is that we can show ordinary people that they do not have to accept this kind of arrogant oppressive treatment at the hands of the people who claim to represent them .
madam chairperson , i found it interesting earlier when the hon member mr byneveldt made the remarks about integrity , when he said by implication that the da , and more specifically the hon premier , were masters when it came to claiming the successes of other people for ourselves .
madam chairperson , it is quite obvious that if an organisation applies for funding from the department , a project proposal is done and there is an assessment committee who assess the project application based on the criteria applied to the beneficiary community and what that community is going to be doing .
( 2 ) members of the executive council of a province may not - ( b ) act in any way that is inconsistent with their office , or expose themselves to any situation involving the risk of a conflict between their official responsibilities and private interests ; ...
madam chairperson , i was personally present in the standing committee , as were other hon members , when the amendments to clause 5 ( 1 ) , which are contained in the cape town international convention centre company bill [ b9b-2000 ] and [ b9a-2000 ] as tabled were made .
the committee therefore recommends that the branch render full assistance and co-operation to the unit in respect of any matter included in their investigation ; and that immediate steps be taken to place the control of all documentation in respect of building maintenance on a sound footing .
the basis of the decision was also the fact that the property value in manenberg as a township was lower than the home loan he had applied for and that the ability of that property to maintain or increase its value over time was negligible and questionable .
madam speaker , having listened to the hon member mr silke it became quite apparent why the erstwhile deputy leader of the dp in the province , cedric mcneill , left that party in disgust , and the hon member has just confirmed that in a very clear way .
the brutality during these attacks is further accentuated by the fact that in 1997 84 ( 14,9 % ) of the victims were killed , and a further 292 ( 51,8 % ) were injured , of whom 135 ( 23,9 % ) were indicated as having suffered serious injuries .
madam speaker , on a point of order : i did not want to interrupt the speaker earlier on , but i feel it is a bad precedent to be set that a speaker should be able in his speech to ask the house to stand for a minute of silence in memory of anybody .
in that meeting it was resolved that all matters requiring further attention be investigated as a matter of urgency , and a further report be submitted to the executive committee after written submissions by councillors and officials had been submitted to the chief executive officer by 15 march 1999 .
one year later , in march 2000 , and a year and a few months after mr van niekerk submitted the report , the executive committee discussed the matter again - and this despite the efforts of the dp and the anc councillors to raise the matter in that time .
i am hoping the hon minister does , because as a lawyer he should have known that the companies act applied to all the board members , and when we raised the conflict of interests issue , they suddenly obtained legal opinion , and suddenly we now know what the companies act states .
if these bomb explosions are not brought under control , let alone eradicated , the finger of suspicion must be levelled at the intelligence unit , which is not functioning properly , or lacks the necessary skills to do the work they are required to do .
let me also say that i distance myself , and the hon leader of the opposition was correct in raising this , from any suggestion that there is a party-political motive , or that any party - certainly not the anc in the western cape - is responsible for this .
while the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works , who is absent today , noted at the previous sitting of the house that things are going well with farm workers in the western cape , at albertinia police station there was already a charge laid against a farm owner for assaulting a farm worker .
we are not really getting down to a debate on how to combat racism and to turn back the legacy of apartheid , but are rather debating about whether we should , in fact , have a debate , whether racism exists and whether we are out of the starting-blocks .
we are so serious about transformation that instructions have been given - i do not wish to provide the name of the company because then i shall again be accused of getting people from other provinces - that if it is necessary to head-hunt , we shall do so .
mr speaker , i must ask you to see to it that the running commentary is no longer tolerated in terms of the rules or else i shall really be obliged to ask you to name certain hon members and suspend them from the house for six days .
that the house congratulates the deputy speaker on her nomination by the anc as its candidate for mayor of the unicity of cape town , and believes that as a woman with a proven track record in the struggle against apartheid and as an excellent hands-on manager , she is a worthy candidate .
if there is any further meddling with my mtef allocation , i will have no choice but to go back to the highest authority , the constitutional court , with the complaint that the central government of south africa does not want to comply with the court 's instruction that we should provide houses .
the da , the party for all , can assure even its fiercest opponents that their interests too will be taken to heart by the da , in contrast to the attitude of the mayor of beaufort west , who said that they would only help those towns where they had won a majority of the vote .
it is a good start to hear the hon premier also say that no one - and i repeat - no one , no matter which party they support , should ever feel that the government is anything other than a helping hand in their journey through life .
mr chairperson , when only 30 % to 40 % of the people in mitchells plain turn out to vote it is a shocking reflection on their state of confidence in the government , especially for a party whom those very same people turned out and supported by over 60 % in the 1994 election .
affirmative action in this province must not be exercised as it was done in the years of apartheid , where a white person with a std 8 certificate stood behind the counter in the post office or at the railway station and the non-white with a std 10 certificate had to mop and sweep the floor .
madam speaker , while i was listening to the hon member mr silke talking about the economy and so on , i realised that what the national government says is important , namely that we will never be able to improve people 's circumstances if we do not have economic upliftment .
this is in line with the national business cycle , although stronger growth is expected in this province , with western cape real growth put at 3,8 % and nominal growth at 9,8 % , which should result in a year 2000 regional product of r96 850 million .
that framework has forced the province -including the individual departments - to take the issue of long-term budgeting seriously and to budget not only for one year or one series of projects , some of which might be politically determined by the government and the ministers in the departments .
i do not have my speech from last year here , but if my memory serves me , i think i said that scof deserves to get greater respect with regard to time to deliberate and also with regard to matters such as the food service and so on .
while we are getting on with the business of fighting the hiv / aids epidemic through the drug azt and through a new western cape programme aimed at treating aids infants and children who are hiv positive , the national government is still fighting over the causes of aids .
i am grateful to be able to say that as far back as 1998 , on my appointment as minister , the western cape government put its foot down and took a deliberate decision to develop the rights of the disabled to the fullest extent as well as the empowerment and development of women and the youth .
we gathered information from all stakeholders , became familiar with procedures , tested certain methods and established networking links and partnerships , not only with external and internal role-players and other departments , but also with the national government , with whom i have been working very closely since my inauguration in 1998 .
the concept of a caring society that the hon premier speaks about in all his speeches , will only be strengthened and deepened when we recognise that disabled people enjoy the same rights as non-disabled people , and that we have a responsibility towards the promotion of the disabled persons ' quality of life .
how do we explain this phenomenon to the mother who has to raise her children in this province , while she is being battered by a partner , has to protect her girl child from violence against women and children , and her boy child from socio-economic violence in our communities that force our children into gangsterism and drug abuse ?
it is just in the western cape that the anc cannot understand that they got 42 % , they did not get a majority and they are not in government , so they should stop being like mongrel dogs and yapping all the time .
all i am saying is that it is wonderful to get up here and speak rhetorically - and in my address i again said that we should not stand up here and just make wild statements - but we have a responsibility to our people out there .
the standing committee on education , environmental and cultural affairs , having considered the subject of the western cape nature conservation laws amendment bill [ b 3-2000 ] referred to it , supported the bill unanimously and begs to report the bill with the following amendment :
as far as the employment equity act , 1998 ( act 55 of 1998 ) is concerned , i wish to point out that our staff have embarked on a process of planning and consultation with a view to having the statutory required affirmative action plan on the table by the date specified .
the amount of r3,75 million was budgeted for id photographs ; r1 million for the salaries and accommodation costs of 45 temporary employees and 5 coordinators ; r500 000 for administrative expenses , including advertisements , community newspapers and pamphlets ; and the r250 000 that i have already mentioned , which is earmarked for registration .
does that mean that for the purposes of today 's sitting these questions are not valid and are transferred for the question paper of the next sitting , or does it mean that now in terms of the rules , as you said , we must bring each hon minister 's question here for oral reply ?
mr speaker , i would like to know from the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation , given that there have been a number of instances where members have felt that they have been treated in a racial manner by the security guards , what steps have been taken to train the guards in that respect .
those people tell us that the literacy rate in the western cape is so high - and sometimes they know more than we think they do - that the western cape is the ideal province for investment and to use those people in the industries that they want to establish here .
it would have been his vision as minister , possibly incorporating the things he said on 16 september 1999 which dealt with designing an alternative system that would look into engaging businesses in contracts beyond the r2 million cut-off limit .
( 1 ) kits were provided by wced to the 21 primary schools that took part in the pilot programmes for hiv / aids life skills education , as well as the 19 school clinics responsible for the training in the 20 % of primary and secondary schools targeted for 2000 .
apart from the unbelievable and unbearable stench - and i was hoping to bring a bucket of the spillage to the house today , but i think that would not have gone too well - the people in the community have suffered immensely due to health problems .
i would like to ask the hon minister , firstly , whether he agrees with the action of the district council of giving those people , including the hon member ms versfeld 's family , keys to the gates so that they may drive their 4x4 vehicles on the beach .
let us work with a greater desire to fast-track blacks and coloureds into the mainstream of the economy to raise the quality of life of all the people in this province and radically narrow the gap between the haves and the have-nots .
madam chairperson , i was a bit surprised that the hon minister - and indeed the department of finance itself - were not able to say exactly how much money they thought we would be able to generate from those casinos when they come on line .
last but not least , i want to convey my sincere thanks and appreciation to the broad public for their involvement in a variety of activities from the community police forums to neighbourhood watches to the supply of information that has played a tremendous role and has contributed towards a reasonably stable province .
mr chairperson , despite the fact that there are only four of them , they are producing excellent results in the schools they visit , although we still have an enormous amount of work to do to develop an understanding of the rule of law and due process among members of our governing bodies .
we will be held publicly accountable and we will hold other people publicly accountable for the way they manage the institutions entrusted to them , so that we can be ensured that we can account to the public for the spending of their money .
after a long period of drastic downscaling and restructuring of health services , following a drop in real term expenditure of just under 10 % over the past four years , the health branch is eventually emerging into a period of stability with opportunity now to refine our services .
of course , the maintenance of the infrastructure at western cape medical facilities is always a problem , and i am pleased to see that it is being addressed substantially in this particular budget - the first time it has been addressed to any large degree for a number of years , i think .
just as the national minister of welfare and population development inherited his current portfolio - and i emphasise in particular the welfare aspect of his portfolio - a few months ago , in the same way it was only four weeks ago that i accepted responsibility for the very important portfolio of poverty relief in the western cape .
my reason for saying so is that if one looks at the growth in this department over the past five years , one sees that once again this year there is only 2,67 % growth , and that the money allocated to certain divisions every year has been quite constant .
it is good to know that we have compassionate and serious people in parliament who really wish to address the issue of poverty , and would really want to come on board and pull their weight and see whether we cannot collectively do something about this issue .
none of the existing local authorities can go ahead with purchasing new it systems and then say that they are going to buy it , it is going to cost us r2 million or r5 million and once they are in the new structure they will figure out how to fit in the rest of the local authorities .
what needs to happen firstly is that local government should accept that it can only provide limited services , and that it is better to provide some things well than many things poorly ; and , secondly , it is inevitable that there will be asymmetry in service delivery based on capacity , tax base and population density .
permit me at this stage to dwell for a while on the coastal zone policy for the province , which is now at an advanced stage of preparation , as i believe it to be one of the most important projects due to be completed during the course of the next financial year .
however , we must appreciate that with the provincial government 's new commitment to a more focused , delivery-orientated and financially efficient set of goals , as articulated in the nine strategic policy goals adopted by cabinet last year , there is a need to review the roles and functions of all provincial institutions .
when we compare the r806 000 that has been given for that issue with the r865 000 that is going to the commissioner for the environment , someone who has not even been appointed yet , and by the hon minister 's own admission will only be appointed at the end of the year , we have a problem .
in conclusion , mr speaker , i want to thank the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling and the house in advance for their understanding of the urgency of this matter and ask them to grant it its fullest attention and consideration in accommodating this direct charges bill .
human rights day has acquired a new meaning , but while they - the ordinary people and the poor people along the west coast , namely the fishing community , the farming community and the miners - strive to achieve a vision of a better life , relief from suffering and poverty , they daily experience the naked realities of hatred and total racism .
mr speaker , if there is any lack of clarity about a motion and about what the mover means by it or is saying by implication , there is objection to the fact that it is being introduced without prior notice ; in other words , that the motion is being put to the members of the house without warning .
it is reported that 10 years ago a fairly junior manager of america online ( aol ) told one of the executives that there is a 10 % stake going in aol for $ 5 million and that he believes they should purchase the 10 % stake .
] i am not sure what to read into that , but perhaps since tony leon called them " rubbish , pathetic and a hollow shell " , i suppose it is difficult to live in a situation where one has to listen to a member of that same party speaking .
madam chairperson , it is interesting to note that peter coyle , who is an irish consultant - and the hon minister and the cabinet have had dealings with him - states that there is a need for urgent and proper research , and the development of an industrial strategy on traditional sectors .
what we do not agree with is that the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism has blocked the process of ensuring that those unregistered shebeens are brought into the tax net , into proper policing and to ensure that under-aged people are not using those shebeens .
the new liquor bill proposed by the national government would have made it virtually impossible for 156 policemen in the western cape to enforce the act , because it took the enforcement away , passing it to a small group of inspectors whom we would have had to appoint from this government .
furthermore , i believe that the only way i can play a constructive role is by making sure that when there is a display of immorality , unethical behaviour , or shamelessness on the part of the new np and the dp , i commit myself to its destruction at every turn .
the latter section of the law allows me to grant authority to defray expenditure of an exceptional nature which has not been provided for in any appropriation law , and which cannot without serious prejudice to the public interest be postponed until appropriation therefor could be made by the provincial parliament .
mr speaker , i believe that one day in the future of this house we shall reach the point when no one in the house will find it necessary to confront the premier and ask him whether he is the premier of all the people of the western cape province .
mr koopman now faces the prospect that the person who bought the houses , mr tommy moolman - who scored a very good deal by buying four houses for less than r20 000 from a da local authority - now wants to evict him and other people .
i am fully aware of some educators , especially anc educators , who are ignoring this and it was very interesting that the spin doctor of the anc , the hon member mr dugmore or dogmore , as the case may be , specifically raised beaufort west , because the anc had better watch its step in beaufort west .
do they want to liberate us from having achieved a 80,6 % matriculation pass rate ; from having the best aids programme in south africa ; from having the best health services in south africa ; from having a clean administration ; and from showing an above average economic growth in south africa despite a poor agricultural year ?
madam chairperson , i would like to ask the minister responsible - i am not sure which one it is - whether it is the intention to continue to make one-off payments to people , with no infrastructure and no support being given for that money in terms of poverty relief ?
all i want to ask the hon minister , in the light of that , is that when he solves this problem , he does so in such a way as to prevent violence spilling over , because it is no longer a matter of drivers , it is now a matter of golden arrow .
thirdly , if we look at the codeta constitution , and this is something that i did not know , we see that it makes provision that if a taxi operator gets one licence , he will automatically get three extra licences , which means that each operator will be guaranteed four licences .
mr speaker , the cape town international convention centre company bill aims to provide for the shareholding which the province has in the company , which is a private company with a share capital , and to further provide for funds which are made available to the company by the provincial government .
then , in a scurry , the department of economic affairs realised that in terms of the convenco agreement , part 2 , the legislation deadline was 30 june 2000 , and if they did not meet the deadline , in terms of the agreement the province would be withdrawn from the process and the agreement would fall away .
secondly , if our involvement in any conduct that has a bearing on what we do publicly excludes us from participation , then every hon member in this house who owns a house , for example , is precluded from discussing any issue to do with planning and the like .
the committee recommends that it be informed by the director-general of the progress made with the implementation of its recommendations within 60 days of the date of this report or as otherwise indicated in specific resolutions and further recommends that this report be discussed by the house .
the committee recommends that it be informed by the director-general of the progress made with the implementation of its recommendations within 60 days of the date of this report or as otherwise indicated in specific resolutions , and further recommends that this report be discussed by the house .
we must continually increase these amounts even though the licence has been awarded , because there are licences which could fall due in the future or could be removed or withdrawn for some reason , and one would then have to go at a higher level for the bid fees .
although i accept the principle of a special rating district , and we have implemented this in the metropolitan area already - we started some two or three years ago in the central business district and it is going very well in that specific area - the difference in this specific legislation ...
we have not asked him to be fired or to resign because , since the quick way in which the hon member ms adams filled the role , the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism has become the greatest asset the anc has on that side of the house .
in the name of reconciliation we must agree that the process of absolution from blame for apartheid atrocities must be effected , and we agree on that , but we cannot accept that there should be an absolution from responsibility for the efforts to reduce racial inequalities .
the hon member mr byneveldt is right , however , that there is one way in which we can fight racism and that is by cooperating , by refraining from coming here to destroy one another , because this motion - i shall come to this later - is very timely and was introduced here for a reason .
that the house congratulates the department of health , the minister of health , prof gary martin , and dr lynn denny , for making azt available to rape victims , and notes that the department is continuing the western cape 's tradition of being the first province to actively combat the hiv / aids disaster .
that the house , noting the admission by mr bob tucker , chief executive officer of the south african banking council , that south africa 's home loan market is dangerously limited , and is failing to meet the needs of hundreds of thousands of south africans earning less than r4 000 per month -
madam speaker , perhaps the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works , who has already achieved jetsetter status as a result of his overseas travels and makes promises to the farmers , like a peter in the bible would look at zimbabwe and decide what positive lessons can be learnt from that .
the state prosecutor of riversdale and albertinia says that over the past year there has only been one conviction on a charge of assault and that person is serving a prison sentence ; three cases are awaiting the pronouncement of the director of public prosecutions ; and there have been no eviction cases - and we hear here that evictions are common practice .
the committee , having heard evidence on the reply to resolution 9 , dated 22 october 1999 , has taken note that the national department of housing issued certain guidelines to the provincial administration only on 7 august 2000 on the implementation of the housing act ( act no 107 of 1997 ) .
the committee recommends that it be informed by the director-general of the progress made with the implementation of its recommendations within 60 days of the date of this report or as otherwise indicated in specific resolutions and further recommends that this report be considered by the house .
the committee recommends that it be informed by the director-general of the progress made with the implementation of its recommendations within 60 days of the date of this report or as otherwise indicated in specific resolutions and further recommends that this report be considered by the house .
mr speaker , i certainly have not heard anything from the other side of the house to convince me to act in any different fashion other than from my friend the hon member mr strachan - i use the word " friend " for descriptive purposes only - where he talks about frivolity .
in order to enforce financial discipline and to enforce the cabinet principle that overexpenditure will be a first debt against a particular vote for the succeeding financial year , amounts of r3,863 million and r1,258 million were also suspended to the provincial revenue fund from the health and education votes respectively for 1998-99 .
that the house , on behalf of the inhabitants of the little karoo , expresses its thanks to the provincial government for sponsoring the voorbrandfees during the klein karoo nasionale kunstefees , and further wishes the management and organisers of the klein karoo nasionale kunstefees the best of luck with the arrangements of the kunstefees .
it smacks of patronage and of taking a poverty alleviation fund and putting it in the premier 's office so that they can deliver patronage , but they are not delivering sustainable attacks on poverty alleviation , and targets and strategies to do so .
when all is said and done , and the hon leader of the opposition , with the hon members messrs dugmore and mckenzie , has finished trying to rewrite the election results - irrespective of all the plans he may have devised at his recent lekgotla to try and win the western cape ...
mr speaker , on behalf of the standing committee on education , environmental and cultural affairs , i would like to make use of this opportunity to thank mr brian o ' connell and all officials of the western cape education department for the selfless service they render to the parents and learners of the province .
i implore the hon premier to undertake an in-depth investigation into the living conditions of our elderly , especially at facilities subsidised by our government , and to work together with community structures to find ways to alleviate the plight of these distressed , but always proud , senior citizens .
] let me also say that the people of langa - the old residents in the established houses - approached me while i was there and their plea to me was to do something about the illegal squatting on their doorstep because those people are using their water and electricity .
only last week , as has been our experience recently , the portfolio committee - which i hear is transparent , but which i think is not transparent - at the last moment , on the last night , made drastic changes to the legislation without the employers or the employees having been consulted .
i have already touched on the province 's mtef and it need only be added that our specific priorities and goals are drawn up within the context of the much broader national framework and are thus dependent on the national perspective as set out in the medium-term budget policy statement of the national department of finance .
mr speaker , it should be noted that we have received changes in our conditional share allocation in respect of health , housing and land development objectives and the financial management of social security systems , that were too late to be taken up in the budget , but which will receive attention in the 2000-01 adjustments estimate .
the committee wishes to express its serious concern that the minister in the office of the premier did not submit any business plans on gender , youth and disabled programmes and recommends that no money be spent in subprogramme 2 , except funds that have already been allocated for personnel expenditure , until business plans are submitted .
we need to put it straight and clearly on the table that it is the result of 350 years of colonialism ; it is the result of a provincial administration that existed in the house from 1910 until 1994 and led by the np on that side of the house .
firstly , the former director-general in the office of the president , jakes gerwel , was made a major shareholder in one of the big players , premier fishing , in 1998 , along with a number of anc and former udf activists , like johnny issel , a former member of this house and now a member of the sekunjalo empowerment consortium .
madam chairperson , although we are grateful that our share of the national budget is reportedly up by 1,8 % , i need to ask the question : why , according to idasa 's budget information service , is the overall increased allocation to all the other provinces , except one , 4 % and we get 1,8 % ?
the committee wishes to express its serious concern that the minister in the office of the premier did not submit any business plans on gender , youth and disabled programs and recommends that no funds be spent in sub-programme 2 , except funds that have already been allocated for personnel expenditure , until business plans are submitted .
whether democratic party fundraisers , as recruited in advertisements in the press , have referred any companies to the department of economic affairs ; if so , ( a ) to what extent and ( b ) whether this facility is available to other political party 's fundraisers ; if not , why not ?
mr speaker , my appeal to the anc is , if they say they want to be part of nation-building , and if they profess that they want to get the province going as well , they should play an active , constructive part and not the destructive part that they are playing now .
mr speaker , contrary to allegations made in the house by hon members on that side of the house about the lack of delivery and vision , i say that we on this side of the house will continue to implement our 100 day plan as announced last year .
we would further like to say that the constitutional status of the motion of no confidence , according to sections 51 ( 2 ) of the western cape constitution and 141 ( 2 ) of the national constitution , removes this motion from the ambit of the ordinary rules and procedures of the house in relation to motions .
( 1 ) the complainant in this matter was informed on 30 november 1998 that the problems currently being experienced at grotto bay can be ascribed to the non-compliance with conditions of approval as laid down with the rezoning approval of 18 june 1991 .
mr speaker , could the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism indicate to us whether any assets under the control of the department of social services - according to a radio announcement hon members will be aware that we have a new minister of social services - have been identified for disposal ?
madam chairperson , based upon my earlier point , and while i know that this province really needs its casino revenues , i personally am sorry in a way that we will be finally enjoying a major slice of own revenue from an activity that often exploits the weaknesses of the human psyche .
i had hoped that he would say to us that he would ensure that the gambling board put in place measures and means to ensure that even those smaller companies that do supply goods and services to the gambling industry would be people who do not have contact with the original shareholders of the casino .
madam chairperson , first of all i want to inform to the hon member mr ramatlakane that when an hon member on this side of the house gives his opinion on something which he feels is still an unfair practice , the hon member mr ramatlakane should not see that as a wind of change .
i have been here since october 1998 , if i remember correctly , and if i had to refer to my hansard in regard to this particular matter , i am sure that we would see that i have promised to honour certain matters , and i am satisfied that the situation will change in the future .
this trend is also in stark contrast to the national crime prevention strategy , which was so painstakingly workshopped in the life of this new parliament by a well-intentioned populace , and which stresses community policing as a minimum requirement for a police service that would have public confidence .
allow me to summarise the facts , and i want to respect these facts as follows : the hon member mr morkel , de jure the premier and physically the occupant of leeuwenhof ; and the hon member mr bester , de facto the premier and in control of almost 60 % of the western cape budget .
it is important that money is not merely allocated to a body , but that monitoring mechanisms also be developed to determine whether this money really ends up where it ought to , particularly when one takes into account the objectives in regard to accessibility and sports facilities that i mentioned earlier .
in a recent survey done throughout south africa , the western cape was voted the most desirable place to live in : 95 % of our people expressed clear satisfaction with the quality of life in the western cape , whilst only 5 % expressed a desire to live elsewhere !
i therefore wrote a letter to governor omar ben mahmoud of tunis , with whom this province has a cooperation agreement , to petition his representative on the world cup bid committee , mr salim aloulou , to back south africa 's bid as hosts for this , the premier world soccer cup .
i therefore wish to pay a very sincere tribute to those who can claim credit for this performance , particularly the officials in the department who are here today - mr brian o ' connell , head of education ; mr brian gilbert , deputy director-general of education : provision ; and mr johan fourie , the deputy director-general : administrative services .
of some 1 530 potentially eligible schools , about one third - or 500 - have already met the requirements to be declared section 21 schools , and qualify for the maximum degree of school-based management in which many responsibilities are devolved to the school governing body and the management team .
we all share a vision of a society in which the health care needs of every person are optimally met , the inherent dignity of every patient is respected and protected , and where health facilities provide an environment conducive to healing and which are the subject of pride for staff and communities .
by using a household income poverty line of r18 000 per annum , that is r1 500 per month , and bearing in mind that the national average of households living in poverty is 64,7 % , the following magisterial districts have been determined as our primary concern in this province .
i am also speaking about the tom sutcliffes and the valdi terblanchs - people who have shown that when one is white and from a public service background , but is part of an integrated team , what one adds depends not on the colour of one 's skin , but on the value of one 's contribution .
that the house calls on the coalition government , and in particular the acting minister of social services , to make emergency relief aid available to the destitute victims of the fires that gutted 45 shacks in the white city squatter camp in mbekweni on 2 march 2000 .
that the house calls on the coalition government , and in particular the acting minister of social services , to make emergency relief aid available to the destitute victims of the fires that gutted 45 shacks in the white city squatter camp in mbekweni on 2 march 2000 .
the key point that i am concerned about is that those very organisations of civil society he mentioned are not being given a chance to be involved in the provincial integrated development framework , which has now become the provincial strategic plan , although the budget still refers to it as the framework , by the way .
madam chairperson , culture is not only about handing out money - and , may i add , in a very peculiarly uneven way - to hundreds of organisations in order perhaps to retain the old order , maintain ethnicity , make people dependent on hand-outs or just do good .
they have to get a high-quality product to the end point to be able to survive in the extremely competitive overseas market , but if the infrastructure is not maintained and kept to an acceptable standard , the input costs will be such that they will be priced out of the market .
i also wish to tell him that in the years that lie ahead we on this side of the house will see to it that the western cape will not tolerate the arrogance of the anc and will not experience the corruption of the anc as the inhabitants of other provinces will experience it .
i am very pleased that contact with foreign visitors is being maintained on an ongoing basis by the hon minister , the department and the standing committee in order to test the climate and convince the industrialists that the western cape has a good investment climate and is a good place to invest .
( 2 ) this is particularly true for black business who have encountered redlining and risk aversion which often takes on a racist character , and that both the dp and the new np have signalled their support for such policies or failed to recognise the existence of a problem ,
in a recent survey done throughout south africa , the western cape was voted the most desirable place to live in : 95 % of our people expressed clear satisfaction with the quality of life in the western cape , whilst only 5 % expressed a desire to live elsewhere !
i therefore wrote a letter to governor omar ben mahmoud of tunis , with whom this province has a cooperation agreement , to petition his representative on the world cup bid committee , mr salim aloulou , to back south africa 's bid as hosts for this , the premier world soccer cup .
however , unfortunately , what we are seeing in the new np is certain members who are completely out of touch with the realities in the townships , and who in fact do not realise that the failure to act on this issue has actually resulted in the people in khayelitsha closing down the taxi ranks themselves .
the anc rejects the constant statement by the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation in the media and in the house that his hands are tied , that he has no powers and that the national government is to blame for the shortage of resources and for the high rates of crime and violence .
the schedules of votes in the bill under discussion refers to money that was taken away from the various ministers and put into a pool - in one instance r199 000 and in the latter case r2,8 million - in order to carry out the very activity that we have been debating today .
i would therefore assume that if a person worked for three days he would get r1 000 and a third of that , or whatever , if he worked for one day . my ministers and i do not sit there and check up who works for a day or two .
madam chairperson , does the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs say that , technically , the money could have been used to have posts in his department for a period of one year as opposed to using such of that money for a three-day registration drive , which had to be voluntary in any case ?
( 1 ) notes the continuous discomfort , inconvenience and unhappiness that the residents and workers at elsenburg experience , due to the insensitive manner in which the provincial government continues to evict them , to cause work uncertainty and to continually discriminate against the coloured and black people at elsenburg ; and
mr speaker , it is precisely this beauty , manifested in our people and our environment , which makes even more painful the experiences some of our people have of grinding poverty , debilitating disease , despairing unemployment , senseless murder , brutal rape , bigoted prejudice and a host of other pathologies .
one of the big benefits of the legislation is that by the stroke of a pen , once they have complied with the application and the preparations , they can transform more than a thousand municipal traffic police officers in the city into people who have full peace officer status and can play an expanded role in particularly visible policing .
already very fruitful relations with international counterparts exist and we want to acknowledge their participation in the western cape as well , but we see much more opportunity and we want to start looking at our own business sector for possible cooperation in an attempt to empower our own communities in the western cape .
mr speaker , the hon premier also wants to promote the aspirations of lonwabo makhoba , a grade 11 pupil , and lerato gagela , a grade 12 pupil - both from khayelitsha - when he says that there is no one in our province whose aspirations he will not promote to the best of his ability .
he spent quite some time on it - i can unfortunately not remember how long , but it could have been somewhere in the vicinity of three or four months - and he personally came and produced to cabinet the report on how he believed this money should be spent .
one of the objectives of convenco is to ensure that the funding of r320 million envisaged for the convention centre is utilised in the most economical manner for the maximum benefit to the facility , the city and the province and that the project is completed within its programmed time-frame .
the new np is of the opinion that the choice of a mayor with executive powers could entail that individuals who have been unable to make the necessary progress at other levels of government , as well as people with no local government background whatsoever , can be appointed or redeployed from outside the local authority in a particular , remunerated post .

( 2 ) this is particularly true for black business who have encountered redlining and risk aversion which often takes on a racist character , and that both the dp and the new np have signalled their support for such policies or failed to recognise the existence of a problem ;
the committee , having heard and considered evidence with regard to the recoverable amounts in respect of road construction expenses and other miscellaneous debts which have been outstanding for extensive periods , wishes to recommend that a thorough investigation immediately be undertaken in each individual instance , including communication with district councils and other role players , to prevent prescription .
the bill also allows for a phase-in period on property that was not previously rated or excluded or exempted from rates , or a property which shows an extraordinary increase in value between the previous valuation roll and the valuation roll in use when the rate is levied .
it is important to note that and we look forward to the possible distinctions which might emerge once the dp and the da unveil their r4 million manifesto to try and create an image out of a sun and a star or whatever it is .
( 1 ) notes with shock and disappointment the recent judgment in the regional court in ceres in the case where sergeant chrisjan myburgh appeared on a charge of attempted murder after he allegedly poured methylated spirits over andr petersen and then set him alight ;
it is a simple fact that bombers and terrorists , the enemies of our people and the enemies of our democracy , whatever the colour of their skin , their appearance , their background or their religious convictions , must know that they will receive little or no mercy and that actions of this kind will not be tolerated .
i also ask the district attorney , and especially the hon premier and the hon minister of community safety , to quell the whisper by some of their over-eager foot soldiers that it is actually the anc that is responsible for urban terror in this province , unless of course they believe this to be true .
mr speaker , this side of the house joins other parties in condemning racism and we commit ourselves to working with all other south africans of goodwill to combat the legacy of apartheid and racism , whether of the old or the increasingly prevalent new variety .
the anc may be obsessed by the fact that the hon minister of health and dr costa gazi are white and male , but i can tell hon members the hiv-positive mothers who benefit from their policies and practices could not care less what colour they are .
given the perilous state of their alliance , their shocking lack of delivery to the poor of this country and their inexplicable stand on zimbabwe and aids , it should come as no surprise that the anc has begun to highlight racial differences in our society and to play the race card at every opportunity .
i received a letter from the hon member mr silke , but i thought that he was simply informing me that he would withdraw the motion in the house , or else it would have been withdrawn at the beginning and then the hon member mr jacobs would have had a case .
the committee therefore recommends that the provincial administration take immediate steps to clarify the correct accounting measures of the relevant housing transactions with the national department of housing and / or other parties that are involved and inform municipalities of the correct application and accounting measures of the provisions of the housing act .
any money appropriated by parliament referred to in clause 18 ( c ) must not refer to a shift of budgeted funds from provincial health departments to the national health laboratory service ( nhls ) , irrespective of whether these funds are part of the equitable share or from a conditional grant .
when the hon premier spelt out his vision , he said that we intended to achieve good service delivery through cooperation and that we wanted to bring the different policies of local government , national government and also provincial government together , so that we could jointly address the vision of improved service delivery and quality of services .
the hard reality is that the eyes of responsible governments throughout the world are fixed on the province of the western cape , on the one hand to see whether the coalition government is capable of sustaining democracy here , and on the other hand to see whether the western cape government can cooperate constructively with the central government .
mr speaker , in conclusion , i want to pay tribute to a very brave , honest and courageous person , a man who had the courage to change the political dispensation of this province in the face of resistance , a man who believes in putting the people of the western cape first - peter marais .
madam speaker , i rise to support our leader , the hon leader of the opposition , and all my comrades on this side of the house who spoke before me on the motion of no confidence in the hon premier and his executive moved in terms of the western cape constitution .
in this regard , and at the risk of boring my audience within the chamber and beyond , i want to reiterate my deep concern about the use of the 1996 census figures for the purpose of calculating not only the equitable share but also conditional grants .
alongside the need to stabilise service delivery , must be the need to maintain existing infrastructure and to build new infrastructure where this is most needed , not only for the economic development of the province , but for the improvement in the quality of life amongst the poorest of our communities .
as far as poverty relief is concerned and the matter raised by the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism , i want to ask whether that side of the house would ask for the resignation of a minister if this side of the house had a minister who did not spend 99 % of the welfare budget .
according to the audit unit , successful conviction is often hampered by the fact that pharmaceutical stock is not marked as the property of pawc and manufacturers issue stock to their customers using the same batch numbers , resulting in both the private and the public sector receiving stock bearing the same number .
in his budget speech the hon speaker raised the issue of the provincial parliament being proactive , transparent and going out to the communities , and this is also an issue that was raised in the committee on rules and internal arrangements - i hope i am not playing on the same old " snaar " !
mr speaker , the hon minister says it has nothing to do with politics , but i have here a press statement made by the hon premier on the day that he wanted to dismiss the former minister of social services and poverty relief in terms of a political statement .
whether any of his staff worked for the registration of voters during the past general elections ; if so , ( a ) how many , ( b ) what were their ( i ) names and ( ii ) positions in the department and ( c ) what were each of them paid for the services ?
mr speaker , in the light of his talking about the poor attendance , is the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation aware that just three days before the meeting that he called , another public meeting was called in bonteheuwel which almost 2 000 people attended ?
i have set out the details of staff losses in my written response , but i must say that i find it a great frustration to orderly reduction of expenditure that the central government has not resolved the question of a retrenchment tool in the past five years .
an application has been made to withdraw the section 239 certificate previously issued in favour of the republic of south africa , and has now been submitted to the national minister for agriculture and land affairs , and at the same time to issue an item 28 ( 1 ) certificate in favour of the western cape provincial government .
( 1 ) the minister for the public service and administration issued in december 1999 the following definition of " disability " in terms of section 3 ( 3 ) ( e ) of the public service act , 1994 , as amended , to assist in the proper monitoring of employment and utilisation of disabled persons in the public service :
mr speaker , i would like to know from the hon premier whether the former minister of community safety , sport and recreation , mr mark wiley , now works for a consultancy firm which has received a contract to run a chrysalis project which was initiated by the former minister of community safety , sport and recreation .
] legally , i fought for two years , and the present hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation took up the fight afterwards , to get this to the stage we are now at , where it is accepted and these people man police stations where they do the job of the police .
they have given the excuse - or the reason , should i say - in regard to not being able to introduce section 228 , which provides for the introduction of provincial taxes , that sars is unable to cope with the matter at the moment .
this project is intended to raise the awareness of parents of their legal obligation to monitor their child 's school attendance , to audit the youth that are not attending school and to provide the necessary resources to help families and educators to cope with issues underlying the truancy problem .
quality education lies at the heart of the dp 's vision of an opportunity society , offering conscientious young people the opportunity for further study and entry into the world of work as motivated , contributing citizens , adding value to society and taking responsibility for their own and their dependants ' fulfilment and advancement .
in conclusion , madam chairperson , the acdp will always play its role of giving constructive criticism , and reserves the right always to ask what we are doing wrong , so that we can always say not only when we are doing things right , but rather when we are doing the right things .
such a vibrant public school system would need to be characterised by the following : it should produce quality education for all the learners ; teachers should display confidence in the system ; and there should be measurable indicators which give the public some concrete way of judging its success .
how do we look the poor in the eye when in this house , the highest platform for legislation in the province , we are so sanctimonious and maintain that we care so much for the poorest of the poor , as has been said in debates here recently ?
we should start the fund and hand the money over to these groups ; we should start developing life skills and help them put their business plans together ; we should help them to become farming experts or whatever , and then those projects should be run by another department .
not only the people of district six , but also the people of pacaltsdorp who were moved out of george and people all over the country who were forcibly removed , are seeing that our government , which has committed itself to a better life for all , is beginning to give back what was taken from them .
i want to inform the hon member mr a j williams as follows : my advice to him is to make a submission to that local authority and send me a copy of it , so that they can , in accordance with the act , ask for permission to use their special operational account to help those communities .
if this province did not constantly look at the various organisations under its aegis and analyse them to see if money could be saved , and improve the facilities to the general public , then the opposite side of the house would want to know why i was spending r2,2 million on the provincial development council this year .
firstly , establishing institutional capacity by setting up volunteer hiv / aids committees in each of the 40 camps ; secondly , training volunteers to do peer counselling ; thirdly , building up a database ; and , fourthly , drafting an hiv / aids policy for the western cape department .
madam chairperson , it could have been the easy way out for me to side-step , avoid or simply ignore this ticklish matter that i want to deal with today , but then i could not be honest towards myself nor could i easily look my voters in the eyes again .
therefore , mr speaker , being the minister responsible for provincial finance i am authorised by the national constitution , the western cape provincial constitution and the public finance management act to table the western cape provincial direct charges bill , as a money bill , today for urgent consideration by the house .
madam chairperson , it is my intention to submit the draft legislation to amend the western cape tourism act well before the middle of this year to enable the house to complete and finalise the legislation by the time we adjourn for the mid-year recess .
madam chairperson , the time has come for us to signal to the farmers that we really care about them for us to set all those safety nets so that they know that the government will look after them not only in the good years but also in the bad years .
this province tries to project itself as the best and getting better , but the handling of this issue reveals what people on the ground are actually saying , that the coalition governs for the few , and does not care about the poor , especially the poor in the coloured and african community .
let me please just say that i have made a ruling at the beginning in terms of the rules of the house , that any hon member may ask any hon minister three questions per vote and the hon ministers can respond in the way that they wish to respond to those questions .
madam chairperson , my second question to the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs is , in applying his mind to the allocation of the vote , did he also apply his mind to the number of personnel who were going to be deployed from his department , and were any of those personnel involved in disaster management preparations for the western cape ?
for example , i think of the hundreds of educators whose assistance was called for to manage the polling stations for last year 's local government elections and who agreed to be trained on two consecutive weekends rather than take time off from school , as educators in anc-governed provinces did .
this house today would like to hear from both the hon minister of transport and works and the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation why the authority that has been given to the hon minister of transport and works cannot be exercised before we make our final conclusion . [ interjections .
well before its establishment , the three current shareholders , believing that an international convention centre would add considerably to our tourism infrastructure , commissioned various consultants and advisors , like kessel feinstein consulting and the professional convention management association , over a period of time to research the project and to design specifications .
there were , as the hon member will recall , two references in clause 5 ( 1 ) to " shareholders agreement " , and the standing committee amended the first reference to " convenco agreement " , which is indeed the correct one , and it is reflected in that way in the bill which is before the house .
the finalisation of the necessary proclamations for referral to the heath special investigating unit , which were scheduled to be reviewed during april 2000 , receive expeditious attention by all role players concerned and a summary of the progress in this regard be submitted to the committee within 15 days of this report .
during the review of various votes , the committee heard and considered evidence which indicated that the finalisation of matters such as recovery of debt , disciplinary measures against staff and prescribed review of accident cases require time consuming follow-up by departments and extended periods of time before satisfactory closure of cases occurs .
the important point is that when we submitted this in the portfolio committee of the national assembly , one of the anc members - i want to say " colleague " because he asked me the question - said , " just accept the executive mayor ; after all , you are going to win the metropolitan region .
( b ) notes the comments by the national leader of the dp that these defections should be seen in the context of what happened within the new np on monday , 14 february 2000 , and that a major civil war was brewing in the western cape new np ;
let me tell them that in this country all the hon members on this side of the house and i - and i am sure hon members on that side of the house , as the hon member mr mckenzie has said - have fought for opposition politics to exist in this country .
mr speaker , when the anc announced its campaign regarding racism in banks , the response from the dp , in the person of ms smuts at national level , and from mr gaum - i am not sure whether he is a member of parliament or not - was that we in the anc were being opportunistic .
having considered the knee-jerk reaction of the dp to the rates issue - and especially to the bill - in the face of the self-evident truths , the only conclusion that one can reach is that the poster campaign of the dp against so-called unfair rates is contextually and intellectually deficient .
mr chris du toit , president of agri sa , said last week that it was becoming increasingly more difficult merely to express sympathy and wring one 's hands and not to make derogatory statements about the ability of politicians and the criminal justice system to put an end to the wave of attacks and murders .
when my office contacted the media official at the citrusdal police station , inspector smit said that the accused argued that they had done it - and this reason is not good enough - because they felt that there was discrimination against them and that they were not being paid enough .
i do not know whether it is because the new np and the dp see the issue as unimportant to them , or whether corruption should be the language of the day and they thererfore do not care about what is happening , or whether the hon premier is the key person in this matter .
they have destroyed that relationship by making personal accusations against me - and this is not the first time - which only under a polygraph test would they admit as being scurrilous , in an attempt to throw mud at me in the hope that some of it may stick .
sir , if pagad are the terrorists that the national government say they are , then the udm seeks to challenge the relevant national ministers to speak to pagad in order to hear their grievances and determine whether their grievances hold water , bearing in mind the rights contained in the national constitution .
mr speaker , as the hon premier was absent earlier on , i would like to reiterate the point made by the hon member mr byneveldt , that what happened outside the samaj centre is shocking , not only to the person of the hon premier , but to his family and those in the meeting .
unless the anc recognise the claims of all races to the title " african " , and not only blacks , the new south african nation will be built upon a foundation of sand and sooner or later it will provoke the dissent and anger of those who are frustrated by its policies .
the sanctimoniousness and self-righteousness of the dp in particular make this country very insecure for whites who have crossed the rubicon , and who have said they want to be part of a transformed south africa , that they accept that the past happened and they are sorry about it , but they now want to build up this nation .
there are many people , specifically in the dp - and i see the hon ministers of community safety and of education are not currently present in the house - who have had certain problems with the fact that the anc issued an election pamphlet under the heading , " platteland baat by anc-beleid " .
the unauthorised expenditure amounting to r1 088 417,40 , arising from the procurement of goods and services without complying with the general conditions and procedures as well as the directives of the provincial tender board , in particular the fact that quotations for service or specific exemption from this procedure had not been obtained , was considered .
the committee heard and considered evidence which indicated that the excess was mainly due to the fact that the expected decrease in staff , as a result of normal turnover or severance packages , had not been realised and the budget allocation for the year was less than the actual total expenditure for the 1997 / 1998 financial year .
i am about to rejustify my comment by telling hon members that at the budget council meeting of 14 january 2000 it was the unanimous view of all the ministers of finance - all nine of them - that the existing policy surrounding issues of disaster should be revised .
there are parts of that we can agree with - especially trying to come together on common issues - but if this sentence means that we must ignore racial issues and ignore the differences caused by the past in this country based on race , then we cannot come together .
the resurgence of witchcraft resulting in child murder , legalised abortion , pornography , gambling which destroys families , outcomes-based education in schools instead of value-based , racial quotas in the workplace instead of merit , situation ethics , the disarmament of law-abiding citizens and the wave of crime and violence is not conducive to the society .
madam speaker , we would furthermore like to see some concrete and visible steps taken by not only the department of social services and poverty relief but also by the provincial government to support and sustain the maintenance and creche centres set up by the national minister of justice .
madam speaker , while the hon premier and i are both proud of this province , i was pleased that he mentioned a few - in his words " uglies " - such as the intolerable treatment of our elderly citizens , the abuse of drugs by our youth and the escalating crime rate .
it is interesting that on the day that the hon premier announces that voter registration is his " most important project " , the leader of the new np is quoted as saying the most important thing for the new np is a campaign to register unregistered voters for the municipal elections .
it is indeed an instructive sight to see the anc mec driving the biggest white mercedes benz available for hire , while the so-called elitist representatives from the western cape chug along the highway in a toyota tax because they believe it is unacceptable to spend taxpayers ' money on luxuries .
in fact , i do not understand what the difference is between what marthinus van schalkwyk said about policy , including poverty , and what the hon member mr marais said , except that the statement rocked the nice , comfortable position of the new np 's partner , the dp .
although this particular section of the pfma will most likely not come into effect on 1 april , its provisions have already been pursued in this budget in order to enhance the budget reform process , which aims to foster a closer link between policy development , medium-term planning and budgeting .
mr speaker , i concur with the hon minister that , in terms of budget reform and the requirements of the public finance management act of 1999 , which comes into effect only on 1 april 2000 , this budget fulfils the requirement of submitting measurable objectives for each main division within a vote .
we have heard a continual refrain from the other side of the house that there is an influx of people into the province ; we have heard that people are running away from inefficiencies in other provinces and that people from the rest of the country are coming to this province to take away these resources .
instead of helping poor and unemployed fishermen to start their own businesses and compete with the big players - as the act intended - the anc members and friends are making deals with the big companies to maintain the status quo and share the profits .
my colleague the former minister of social services and poverty relief , who is not in the house now , made it absolutely clear in cabinet that he was in the process of appointing a consultant , not only in this regard but to deal with poverty relief throughout the province .
madam chairperson , owing to the fact that the desks were only established during the latter part of 1999 and the youth desk was only established on 1 november 1999 , it is quite obvious that the full amount of r1,664 million could not have been spent by the end of the current financial year .
madam chairperson , this extra funding will be necessary to fill at least another four posts apart from the five extra posts which we will be able to fund from the allocated budget and which will have to include language practitioners to enable us to meet our constitutional obligations .
the very serious point is that after this meeting , where he only heard one side of the story , the hon minister spent a few moments in the office of the developer , unannounced , without any time being given for preparation to the developer to put his side of the story .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation whether he can give the house a commitment that he , in future , will not make allegations of which he is not sure and , in so doing , create a perception in general that arsonists are at work in the western cape .
consumer education is an ongoing concern that is attended to through radio talk shows - for example , radio atlantis , radio helderberg , radio 786 , radio kc ( paarl ) , breriviervallei radio , umhlobo wenene and so on - distribution of material to the offices of non-governmental organisations , libraries and so on , as well as presentations and workshops .
my question to the hon premier is : does he not think it is unacceptable that his office has not yet agreed to these particular requests by the heath commission or that he as premier is not able to tell the house whether the cabinet has agreed to these investigations or not ?
mr speaker , in the light of the answer by the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism , how does he explain the fact that the publicity material issued by omega conference and workshops organisers stipulates quite clearly that this conference or workshop has been organised in association with the western cape tourism board ?
the only way that one can pass on information , whether it be in tourism or elsewhere , is to bring as many of the junior staff involved as possible to see who the ugly minister is , so to speak , and for them to understand what goes on at the coalface .
mr speaker , in conclusion , i wish once again to thank the hon premier ; my cabinet colleagues ; the director-general ; department heads , and specifically mr cedric ismay , the acting head of finance ; and the western cape team finance and all the staff concerned for their diligent input and support during the preparation of the second adjustments estimate for this financial year .
this contract expires at the end of february 2001 , and during the first 12 months the following was achieved - and the amounts i am going to quote are approximate rounded off figures : accounts handed to debt collector , r30,5 million ; cash recovered , r1,7 million ; instalments arranged , r3,2 million ; garnishee orders received , r1,2 million ; irrecoverable accounts returned , r2,5 million .
i am not attacking the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism - i wanted to say " my colleague " , and he is just about a colleague - but on numerous occasions i have mentioned to him that there is r250 million lying in asset management for the privatisation of that portfolio .
the positive effect since officers have been appointed to address the truancy problem in schools , is another sign of the hon minister and his department 's commitment to help and also assist our children to become disciplined members of the community , particularly those who have been seriously neglected .
think of ernie els , breyton paulse , paul adams and our up-and-coming young swimmer zaida jardine from mitchells plain who , at the age of 15 , is already the country 's top breaststroke swimmer in her age group and ranks third overall in the open category , only a few seconds behind superstar penny heyns .
i am aware that the directorate : sport and recreation is involved in trying to coordinate a policy on the question of school sports and that they have made available a sum of r100 000 per annum to the united school sport association of south africa , ussasa , who is charged with the coordination of school sports leagues and competitions .
these things do not just happen ; amongst other things they require a great deal of planning for students with a range of different needs ; budgeting ; curriculum development ; the preparation and delivery of materials ; infrastructure and other resources ; the creation of a conducive working environment ; the assessment of educational outcomes ; and the structured coordination of these efforts .
it is not widely known that in contrast to pupils who follow normal academic programmes , as many as 95 % of the pupils who attend these schools get work when they leave the schools and in this way are not a burden to the state , but make a contribution towards the economy of our country .
i have said this on a previous occasion and i want to repeat it : after some of our headmasters attended a country-wide congress in the eastern cape last year , many of them told me that it was only now that they realise how privileged they are in the western cape and that they have nothing to complain about .
i look at a principal such as the one at phakama secondary school , who stands her ground and says to pupils that she will not let them wander off the school premises at any time during school hours and then faces attack from those very pupils whose interests she is trying to protect .
i mentioned in my speech that if we empower the communities , hospital boards and clinic boards to do their own upgrading by using smaller contractors , it would definitely be far better than to wait for the long process of going though public works to have it done .
i am even more disappointed at the restructuring process when i view it within the context of the statements made by the hon premier in particular from time to time - and i believe he makes those statements within the policy of the party to which he belongs - to the effect that he believes in multiparty democracy .
the political parties need to appoint candidates who will be able to perform , because at the end of the day one can have good procedures and good instruments , but if the people that are appointed to those positions are not people of good potential that can deliver we are failing the whole system .
i am not suggesting - and no one in their right mind would - that we should follow the mugabe principle of taking away people 's rights , because then one may as well put up a sign outside south africa 's borders which reads , " no investors wanted " .
the matter has been debated for many hours and the arguments have no doubt been exhausted and nevertheless the end of this dispute is still nowhere in sight in the beautiful walker bay , and neither i nor the new minister of environmental and cultural affairs can get this matter to go away by wishful thinking .
to guide the process towards safer roads in the province , the provincial road traffic management committee has drafted the road traffic safety management plan , which outlines the process to be followed over the next five years to achieve our aim of reducing the number of casualties due to road accidents in the western cape by 10 % per annum .
the one thing that always concerns me regarding works - and i am sure the hon minister will agree with me - is that the department of health will report that they are building , for instance , 11 hospitals , and the department of education will report that they are building six schools .
had there been a balance , the state could have played a neutral role , but given the historical imbalances between white and black , between the haves and the have-nots , the state must play an active role in the total emancipation or liberation of the poor , to use a simpler word .
to add " and that the committee shall consist of the leader of the house , mr c b herandien , as chairperson , and further the same ordinary members as appointed in the ad hoc committee that the house appointed on 10 september 1999 to investigate certain utterances by the minister of local government .
madam chairperson , budget statement 2 which was circulated with the documentation as tabled in the house , defines the mission of the department as being " to actively promote an environment that will sustain a dynamic world class economy for the equitable benefit of all the residents of the western cape .
( 1 ) expresses its concern about the use of an official dwelling on the premises of leeuwenhof by an official in the office of the premier for the past five years without having a contract in place or paying a market-related rental which could have resulted in a possible loss of revenue ; and
mr speaker , it certainly is a strange day in the house - we referred to the word " strange " - when the hon member ms essop makes the statement that it is not really necessary to register voters because they are all going to vote for the anc anyway .
in other words , mr speaker , whilst i listened very intently to what the hon member mr ozinsky said , and also his quotations from the letters , unless one has the full picture before one , including all the letters , one cannot judge the matter fairly .
madam chairperson , i would like to ask the hon minister of transport and works from which programme the amount of r36 000 was obtained - given the fact that in the last budget debate he said that he required more money - and which programme reflected a savings ?
after the recent promises to the people of manenberg , hanover park , paarl and elsies river that the da will provide safer communities , we ask the minister of community safety why it is that our children are still being gunned down in our streets , and that after the da has been voted in , they are quiet about these deaths .
we can have as much economic development as we want to , we can believe that the panacea for all things is tourism , but if we do not empower communities and restore people 's quality of life and dignity , and do not allow them to speak about racism , we will not be able to build a common destiny .
they effectively have a monopoly over transport and in a situation of crisis they are the only winners , especially if in the long run golden arrow is forced to cut down on staff , because it is unviable to keep paying for work not done or commuters lost .
i told the national minister of transport this afternoon that if he had not concluded reasonable agreements within 24 hours from today , then i would ask him tomorrow to ask the president for more people to be brought here from the national defence forces , rather than to send troops to the congo .
if there is a dispute between hon members that the bill they now see before them is not the same bill they saw in the standing committee , and the amendments were not drawn up within the standing committee , then i feel that we must try to resolve the matter .
with a view to preventing the misuse or inappropriate utilisation of state funds for the benefit of a particular institution or interest group , the committee wishes to recommend that departments undertake a proper analysis and investigation to ensure that all applicable prescriptions are complied with before any specific expenditure is incurred on instruction by a member of the provincial cabinet .
furthermore , dr christopher forsyth in his definitive work on the apartheid era judiciary entitled , in danger of their talents , contends that the apartheid era judiciary failed to understand the plight of south africans who fell outside the then ruling class - the blacks , coloureds and indians .
however , they were not substantively independent , because most of the judges of the apartheid era , and unfortunately most of them are still on the bench today , were an integral part of the apartheid structure which had created and maintained injustice and they made little effort to extricate themselves from this mindset .
the good news , and i must agree with the hon member mr a j williams that we should congratulate the police , is that in all but one of the 11 cases of murder , the saps have arrested a number of suspects and the law is dealing with them .
although the right of the media to keep the community informed is recognised and respected , i fear that at times the perception may arise that farm murders are singled out to some extent and almost regarded it as more important - i do not know whether one can say that murder is more important - than other forms of crime .
at all the meetings of the task team which i attended , i made the point that the work of the task team should not unnecessarily be drawn out , that the matter had been going on since the beginning of 1998 , and that there was no need for us to cause further delays .
the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism 's insistence on remaining on the board is a red flag to me , because if he were so concerned about this development , he would want it to be creditable and beyond question , and for there to be integrity in the process .
indeed , i think there is room for the standing committee dealing with security issues in parliament to call for a session - and i think preferably a closed one - with the responsible police officers and to ask to be fully briefed on what is actually being done .
in terms of section 25 ( 1 ) i may authorise the use of funds from the provincial revenue fund to defray expenditure of an exceptional nature which is currently not provided for and which cannot , without serious prejudice to the public interest , be postponed to a future appropriation by this parliament .
i agree with what the hon member mr dugmore said , it is very clear that we are not speaking about all farmers in the western cape but about those who are largely responsible for this injustice towards farm workers that has been committed , and ten to one they are members of the da .
it is further recommended that the local division of the bargaining council and the provincial administration , as a matter of urgency , reach consensus on the corrective action to be taken with regard to improved service conditions at the ashton , citrusdal , stilbaai and vredendal municipalities as well as the breede river district council , which do not comply with the relevant requirements .
the unauthorised expenditure amounting to r201 654,18 , arising from the procurement of goods and services without complying with the general conditions and procedures as well as the directives issued by the provincial tender board , in particular the fact that quotations for services or specific exemption from this procedure had not been obtained , was considered .
mr speaker , it is my pleasure to announce today that the head of the independent electoral commission in the western cape , rev courtney sampson , is here and is listening to this debate because there are a number of important issues that we think he needs to take into account in the execution of his duties .
concerning the national government 's reluctance to provide azt to pregnant mothers , i can only join archbishop desmond tutu in criticising the government 's plan to buy fighter aircraft , corvettes , helicopters and submarines worth $ 5 billion from canada , france , germany , sweden and the united kingdom .
if one were to compare the situation between cape town and lusikisiki in 1994 - which at that time was part of the cape province - or the situation between cape town and / or danielskuil and springbok , which are now both in the northern cape , one will see how the resources were sucked out of those areas into this province .
mr speaker , i made a sign to the hon minister to indicate to her that we wanted her head to roll ; a sign that not only the hon premier has made on a number of occasions before in the house , including the hon minister of finance and development planning ...
the hard reality is that as a result of the allocations channelled to the province from the central government , by way of allocations and supposedly specified formulae , as well as other national allocations , the province is being handicapped as regards the planning and delivery of services in terms of its own successful management achievements over the past financial year .
at the same time we would like to say to the hon minister that we will never stop our fight for representivity in every institution in this country ; we will never stop our fight against racism ; and we will not be threatened or bludgeoned into a situation where we do not debate each and every issue , including racism .
] for that reason i am amazed that some members of the opposition make such a fuss and attack the effort by the cabinet to assist people who were disenfranchised because they lacked the funds to obtain those identity documents , to exercise their democratic right ...
with this in mind , and in cooperation with the official responsible for transformation , the initiatives of the desks will jointly focus on policy development for the various focus areas of the desks ; development of monitoring and evaluation systems for interdepartmental integrated programmes of action ; development of an overall communication policy ; awareness-raising campaigns ; and advocacy and lobbying policy .
to be determined are : the definition of poverty alleviation , the location of the poverty relief portfolio within the provincial administration , the required structure and infrastructure of this portfolio , the development of a provincial poverty relief policy document , the formulation and development of a policy document for poverty relief and the formulation and development of a business plan for the poverty relief desk .
in the light of his statement in the press that some of the fires in the western cape were caused by arson and others by criminal negligence , ( a ) whether he has laid any charges in this regard and ( b ) what steps have been taken by the saps to investigate these charges ?
mr speaker , to depart from the pally-pally nature of the questions , can the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs tell us whether he would concur with the national minster of water affairs and forestry , that strict penalties should be incurred on private citizens on whose property alien vegetation is allowed to grow ?
whether the salary scale of the former minister of social services and poverty relief was adjusted to that of an ordinary member of the provincial parliament after his removal from his ministerial position on 14 february 2000 ; if not , ( a ) why not and ( b ) what would the financial implications of this have been ?
whether any progress has been made with regard to the refurbishment of the entrance to the provincial parliament and the office accommodation of parliamentarians ; if so , ( a ) when will the plans be approved , ( b ) when will the expected renovations begin and ( c ) when will it be completed ?
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon minister of local government and development planning , given the fact that these regulations now have to be rewritten because they are unconstitutional - as we told him at the time - what the extra cost will be to complete the regulations .
madam chairperson , in accordance with the value for money principles which are encoded in the pfma , we should ensure that the budget targets set in respect of expenditure , deliverables and transparency are reported on by the provincial departments and provincial public entities , and are evaluated for their contribution towards efficient and effective utilisation of funds .
the hon minister of finance and development planning , unable to shift gear or think on his feet , quoted the national minister of finance about the need for cooperative governance as if he were attacking us , but we have repeatedly shown our commitment to cooperative governance .
what is a known fact is that the rsa is totally under-policed by international standards , has a rising crime rate of 4 % , has the highest violent crime ratio in the developed or developing world and has more officers killed on duty and off duty than any other so-called stable country on earth .
our biggest concern regarding this vote is the possibility that it can eventually happen that we have competent staff in this department who are not in a position to bring to fruition the noble outcomes that i have just mentioned , for the simple reason that there is not enough money to do so .
they are the st mary 's children who formed the guard of honour ; the children of the cape town high school who were the flower girls ; the representatives of our flower sellers on the horse carriage ; the cape town opera chorus - what a wonderful choir ; and the girls ' band and the two youth platoons from the uniting reformed church youth brigade .
secondly , we cannot tolerate drug abuse in the western cape escalating or the murder rate being the highest in the country because of central government 's inability to do something about it , whilst tying our hands behind our backs when we so clearly have the political will to do so .
however , over the past year we did manage to effect a r70 million savings through personnel reduction and the following programmes were the prime beneficiaries : the safe schools programme ; bus transport in rural areas ; learner support materials ; the improvement of facilities ; boarding houses for rural pupils and boarding subsidies for the indigent ; and capacity building of governing bodies at schools .
they visited more than 500 families through this project ; only 10 % of street children are female , of whom 2 % remain on the street ; and they resettled 258 children - a very important success - of whom almost 90 % remain in their families and communities at the end of the six-month period .
i hear , however , that a day or three ago a municipality - and i do not need to name it - that had a good credit control policy in place decided that receipts were excellent and scrapped their policy , because they no longer needed to apply it .
the way in which the planning takes place , in particular the fine balance that will have to be maintained in keeping the developer and the entrepreneur happy on the one hand and on the other , seeing to it that we protect our environment and do not damage it , requires good footwork on the part of the province .
they are the st mary 's children who formed the guard of honour ; the children of the cape town high school who were the flower girls ; the representatives of our flower sellers on the horse carriage ; the cape town opera chorus - what a wonderful choir ; and the girls ' band and the two youth platoons from the uniting reformed church youth brigade .
secondly , we cannot tolerate drug abuse in the western cape escalating or the murder rate being the highest in the country because of central government 's inability to do something about it , whilst tying our hands behind our backs when we so clearly have the political will to do so .
] i think the udm owes this house an explanation in regard to the role of their members in a march where certain people , as part of that march , resorted to violent clashes with the police , which at the end of the day led to the death and injury of a number of people , in khayelitsha in particular .
if one brings a motion of this kind to the house which cuts across the entire spectrum of the community then my appeal is that he leaves his cow or bull outside and i shall leave my cow or bull outside so that we can discuss the matter that affects the community .
it also has a great deal to do with the fact that this coalition is in a very deep crisis and the fact that the dp is doubling its votes in places like mitchells plain by doing one thing only , putting up posters which play on the worst fears of ordinary working people in those communities .
madam chairperson , could the hon minister of social services and poverty relief indicate how many members of the personnel of his department were deployed and where they were deployed in terms of the funds allocated under this vote , and whether he has received any report on the functioning of the personnel in his department ?
mr speaker , let me start by congratulating the hon premier on his 60th birthday and expressing the wish that was expressed yesterday , that he spend as much of his remaining decades on earth as possible in a state of quiet retirement , whether voluntary or enforced , and that is on record .
this is a tiny issue , but one has to do a little door-to-door canvassing in an area like tafelsig , elsies river , guguletu or napier to realise that the fact that they cannot even put a little food on their own tables is what makes it impossible for people to live quality lives .
if we do not help our young matriculants to gain the opportunity to find work , they disappear in the masses and begin to wonder whether it was at all worth it to achieve the most important milestone of their young lives , namely to pass matric , with great trouble and financial sacrifices .
mr speaker , i would like to join my fellow colleagues in thanking the departments for their outstanding contribution over the last day or so , and particularly also the chair of the standing committee , whom i think has handled the presentations extremely effectively , with or without the echo in my case .
on 19 may 2000 the hon minister of transport and works and representatives of the taxi associations met to agree to the following : all violence and intimidation must cease immediately ; all legal permit holders have the right to operate ; and the community has the right to use the public transport of its choice .
mr speaker , we believe it very important that this problem will only be stabilised once all political parties buy in to stabilise the situation , and that it will not be seen by the line that the hon member mr isaacs took , that there are political motivations behind everything ; and
mr speaker , most importantly , can we take a minister seriously who in his vision speech to the house on 9 september 1999 , in the one paragraph where he referred to taxis and spoke about the minibus formalisation process , told us that , and i quote from hansard : western cape , vol 2 , p 232 :
( 2 ) urges that the process of settling claims in areas such as kraaibosch , slangrivier and knysna in the southern cape and throughout the province is speeded up to ensure that those who were deprived of land and the productive means to generate wealth can be compensated and their dignity restored .
four international operators were placed on a short list after public invitation and international advertisement , and the hon minister of finance and development planning , who is also the chairperson of convenco , will act on behalf of the province in the team which left for europe last night to visit three of the four possible operators in situ .
of course , we pointed out firstly that the 21 days allowed had expired , and they had been given enough time to submit evidence ; and secondly , that even if they had other persons or bodies to give evidence , weclogo , which is a member of salga , had been well represented .
the board subsequently indicated that the request was rejected as the capital expenditure of approximately r2,3 million could not be justified at that point in time and recommended that additional reprographic equipment be hired for a specific period while quotations were being obtained to be submitted to the board for approval as soon as possible .
mr speaker , i here today by almighty god state that neither i nor any member of my family or associates have any present , past or future interest in any matter relating to any development of the convenco site or , in fact , any other site in close proximity to the convention centre .
finally , we should not allow our concern with countering terrorism to distract us from attending to the socio-economic welfare of the community ; something to which i believe the western cape government remains committed and where it has a proud record , and to which the entire house is indeed committed .
madam speaker , i think that a short history lesson to the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works is an appropriate way to start my speech , since we on this side of the house are convinced that he is suffering from total amnesia as regards the agricultural situation in south africa and more specifically the western cape .
i told the former minister of social services and poverty relief a year ago - and the hon premier is aware of this - when we had discussions when we were going to leave , " peter , a year after the election gerry morkel will drop you like a hot cake .
i would like to request the hon minister responsible and the director-general to look into ways of making this area more attractive and financially rewarding , as well as ways to keep good staff who go through our training systems - at cost to us - only to leave us for the private sector .
whether the department has identified all national , provincial and municipal land in the cape metropolitan area which is suitable for low cost and social housing ; if not , why not ; if so , ( a ) which parcels of land have been identified and ( b ) what process is in place to release this land for housing development ?
if one looks at the agreements with other provinces , like bavaria for argument 's sake , which invested in some of our schools - they have a r1,7 million project in the western cape and others to follow - then i believe this will be similar to that and that we will have an interchange of investments , technology , culture and so on .
mr speaker , as a follow-up question , is the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism and leader of the dp aware of the fact that some of the fundraisers recruited by the dp have taken his party to the ccma for unfair labour practice in regard to how they have been used in this fundraising campaign ?
whether she is aware of it or has directed that learners in schools in the province are tested for hiv / aids ; if not , why not ; if so , ( a ) at which schools were the tests carried out , ( b ) when were the tests carried out and ( c ) what were the results ?
mr speaker , the long delay in publishing the regulations by government has promoted us to be proactive and the board has invited a tender to appoint a suitable service provider to assist them in the formulation of a preferential procurement policy applicable to all provincial contracts .
whether there is a shortage of pharmacists and pharmacy support staff in provincial health facilities ; if so , ( a ) what are the reasons , ( b ) what are the relevant figures , ( c ) whether this contributes to the long waiting hours at health facilities and ( d ) what steps will be taken in this regard ?
i cannot give exact statistics , but we are absolutely determined that they will not go the same route through voluntary severance packages or retrenchment - we understand a retrenchment package will be available next year - so we will make sure that the integrity of the hiv / aids programme is maintained .
the one thing i dislike intensely - i know that the hon premier has raised this matter on occasion - is that he mentioned retired politicians by name , kobus meiring and lampie fick , and started to criticise them , while they were not able to defend themselves .
he talked about the situation of casinos generally and complaints which he had received in regard , i think , to the supplying of goods to casinos and the fact that there were front companies being taken over by sun west or sun international in order to supply the casinos .
this has important policy implications , the most important of which is that we will devote considerable effort and support to those historically disadvantaged schools that demonstrate , according to various carefully identified indicators , that they are making a concerted effort to get the basics in place and serve their students well .
another problem that education in the country as a whole and in the province faces is the power of the teacher unions , which undermines strategies designed to improve productivity and efficiency , and enables them to place demands unrelated to performance indicators , productivity increases or the availability of resources .
" are we too afraid to do our share of transformation and confront the challenges of transformation of education in the province so that when we encounter conflicts as a result , we can at least say that we dirtied our hands in an effort to be part of this transformation process ?
fourthly , i ask western cape general practitioners to consider prescribing antibiotics to the elderly and people at risk preventatively , so that they start taking them as soon as they develop a sore throat , headache , runny nose , and so on , and not wait until they have to take to their beds .
i shall never forget posing a question to the hon premier asking him what he thought about the hon minister 's appointments to those commissions and the exclusion of the minority parties there , and whether there was any limitation on the figures in the light of his supporting a multiparty democracy .
the fact that local government , as a government sphere in its own right , has become an independent partner in the governance of our province and our country , and is empowered to decide on its own affairs , must cause us to give careful consideration to the most appropriate and beneficial purpose of these statutory bodies .
a recent innovation by this ministry is to initiate an annual provincial culture award for the performing arts , to be awarded to outstanding individuals who are from the western cape and who have made a positive change to the cultural landscape of the province , such as mr ray ntlokwana , the most recent recipient of this award .
programmes on the disease are run regularly at the youth camps and the department is a partner in a project funded by the national department of arts , culture , science and technology called the paper prayers project , which looks at engaging hiv-positive people in a printmaking and art therapy programme .
this hon minister has the great responsibility to ensure equity and fairness of duty and to enhance progress in such a way that people themselves continue to change and become people with sound moral values , with a respect for our environment , aspiring to a better tomorrow where realistic dreams and aspirations can come true .
that the house expresses its good wishes to the muslim community of south africa , and in particular the muslim community of the western cape , for a peaceful eid-ul-adhaa celebration , also known as labarang hadj , and further assures all muslim brethren who completed their holy pilgrimage in mecca , saudi arabia , of its sincere prayers for their safe return to their families in south africa .
mr speaker , it is very interesting that the udm in its input here today did not reveal the fact that its national leader , bantu holomisa , in a desperate attempt to hold together what little support their organisation still has , has clearly positioned itself to become a political party for certain taxi organisations .
given the fact that this schedule was out in december 1999 already and the hon minister was not able to obtain the answer to this question , what would his attitude be , should he find that the money was not appropriately spent , when he is supporting the authorisation of the expenditure under this appropriation ?
mr speaker , it is not mere coincidence that , firstly , the work started coming to them by outsourcing and subcontracting immediately after the national government published its white paper on tourism , in which clear emphasis was placed on black empowerment and empowering the communities that were disadvantaged by previous policies .
madam chairperson , i would like to ask the hon minister of housing whether the moneys indicated here as expenditure in terms of the irene grootboom community will be the only expenditures made , or does he anticipate more expenditure having to be made in the light of the constitutional court judgment ?
( 1 ) congratulates the minister for agriculture and land affairs , the land claims commissioner in the province and the dysselsdorp claimants committee on the r25 million agreement reached to settle their claim and allow the community to go back to the land from which they were forcibly removed by the np government ; and
the committee , therefore , wishes to recommend that the director-general takes steps to improve and extend the relationship between the department of justice ( particularly the office of the state attorney ) and the provincial administration and for him , if considered necessary , to propose a review of the capacity problems within the aforementioned department as well as the administration where required , on an urgent basis .
it is very clear that the leadership of the new np , actively supported by the hon premier , has chosen to try again to ride both horses , to play white oppositional politics particularly , and they have put the task team together in order to see whether they can salvage a deal which drives white oppositional politics .
mr speaker , i am speaking about organised smmes , such as the black management forum ; the foundation for african business and consumer services ; fabcos , sabtaco , the african builders association ( aba ) , the black lawyers association , the national black contractors and allied trade forum ( nabcat ) , and the association for advancement of black accountants in southern africa .
vote 2 - provincial parliament [ pr 15 / 2000 ] vote 8 - trade , industry and tourism [ pr 16 / 2000 ] vote 11 - environmental and cultural affairs [ pr 19 / 2000 ] vote 12 - education [ pr 66 / 2000 ] vote 17 - transport [ pr 37 / 2000 ] ;
the committee , having heard and considered evidence with regard to outstanding financial statements of certain local governments as well as the unsound financial administration of the former management boards ( transitional councils ) in the western cape , has taken note of the implementation of management support programmes by the western cape department of planning , local government and housing at deserving local governments .
the committee wishes to expresses its concern about the standard of the key measurable objectives , outlooks and performance indicators of departments and parliament and recommends that they be referred back for review ; that they be tabled in the budget statement 2 document later in the financial year ; and that they form part of this document next year .
it is a watchdog that sees all black corruption as ultimately exploitable , and when it comes to an allegation or even a suspicion of similar corruption happening on the other side , there is a massive defence of the kind and order that we have seen from the hon minister of community safety now .
a member must withdraw from the proceedings of any committee of the cabinet or an executive council considering a matter in which the member has any personal or private financial or business interest , unless the president or the premier , as the case may be , decides that the member 's interest is trivial or not relevant .
that the house , noting the recent bomb explosions threatening also the safety of the premier , calls on the national minister of safety and security to do everything in his power to stem the violence of urban terrorism which is prevailing in the cape metropolitan area .
we have just witnessed that with the hon member ms essop - even if she has to invent quotes , not to mention a picture of a stork sitting on a dustbin , which she failed to mention , and then flogs it to death to extract the last ounce of electoral gain .
any individual racist acts that white south africans may still be perpetrating against their fellow south africans , and those racist acts do happen and we deplore them unequivocally , pale into insignificance against the injustices currently being perpetrated by black leaders in this country against the black fellow citizens they claim to represent .
the committee , whilst taking cognisance of the fact that the matter was investigated by internal audit , that no impropriety had occurred and that steps had already been implemented to effect an improvement regarding purchases of this nature , nevertheless wishes to express its dissatisfaction at the lack of training and disregard for tender board directives .
if we look at the election results of last year and compare them to the election results of 1994 , and this is also in reply to a question the hon member mr n m isaacs asked me yesterday , we will see that the number of votes the new np received dropped by 45,5 % .
mr speaker , in the interests of what the hon premier said in his opening address , as well as the reply by the hon leader of the opposition , i challenge the hon members on that side of the house to visit my office when they need to talk - whether on or off the record .
sir , mr justice davis said in the high court that we were not obliged to provide adults with dwellings , but we were obliged , in terms of section 28 of the constitution of the republic of south africa , act 106 of 1996 , to provide dwellings for children , and then their parents would be entitled to live there .
it was clear that the hon premier 's words , " there is no one in our province whose concerns are not my concerns " , was not meant for the people of elsenburg , or should one deduce that the words " all the people " do not include coloured and african people ?
the iec may say , after the provincial government said that it was going to run a campaign , that it does not have a problem with it , but the point we are making is that the legal advice was that the iec should request the assistance , otherwise the assistance would be interference in the impartiality and fairness of the election .
the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism kept on appealing to the people in the gallery instead of addressing the house because he wanted to be heard by the audience when he said that they were doing their best ; they have not done anything yet .
regarding the social services sector : given the cabinet 's policy guidelines , short and long-term social and economic factors , possible efficiency gains , and the limited potential for revenue improvements over the short term , the overall and individual amounts per subsector have been re-estimated to substantially strengthen the provision and maintenance of an acceptable level of service over the current mtef period .
the relatively small growth in national funding over the medium term - 3 % for 2000-01 and 2001-02 , and 2,7 % for the outer year - is to some extent compensated for by the fact that own revenue is budgeted to grow by 11 % for 2000-01 to 2001-02 , and by 7,4 % from 2001-02 to 2002-03 .
in addition , over recent years , education spending has reportedly favoured technical rather than teacher training colleges , which is an important trend if we consider the need in this province for the development of those skills necessary for the growth of those sectors of the economy which we have identified as priorities .
sir , scof dealt in detail with the bill , which in terms of section 226 ( 2 ) of the national constitution and section 58 ( 2 ) of the provincial constitution , appropriates amounts for the financial needs of the western cape provincial government in the financial year starting on 1 april 2000 and ending on 31 march 2001 .
the hon minister of finance and development planning as well as dr j c stegmann , mr c ismay and all the other relevant officials deserve congratulations on the many initiatives they took , and in particular the availability of more digestible and accurate information in comparison with what we received in the past .
] speaking of her own experience at the dp 's federal congress yesterday , margaret donga - one of only three opposition mps in that great democracy in zimbabwe - reminded us of a very simple truth : " if you want to rule people for as long as you can , keep them poor and uninformed .
we have seen , in the saga concerning the hon member ms essop , how the rules and internal arrangements committee , or more accurately the coalition component of it , has been used as the handmaiden of the executive to do its dirty work - to take out the chamber pot , if you wish .
mr speaker , would the hon minister not have thought , if that was the way the press had reported it and it was incorrect , that it would have been a good cause of action to write to the newspaper and correct what was clearly , in his terms , a wrong perception ?
mr speaker , would the hon premier agree with the frustration raised by judge heath at the standing committee on public accounts that after six months he had not yet received a reply from the office of the premier to a request to agree to these proclamations that he requested ?
mr speaker , i would like to ask as a follow-up question whether the hon minister agrees with the proposal that it would assist if , instead of having only the photographs of the hon premier and the members of the coalition cabinet , photographs of all the members were displayed at the entrances .
mr speaker , i want to know from the hon premier what steps he has taken to assist the public protector in his investigation into allegations of corruption in regard to the smartie town housing development in macassar , which have raised questions about the role of the hon minister of housing as well as new np councillor jannie beukes .
when we have to amalgamate schools - and we know that , for the teachers , it is always about posts - we see how the choice of the parents , particularly the poor parents , that of the teachers and those of all political parties , not to mention that of the anc , clash .
the hon leader of the opposition also knows , because he was part of it at that time when he was a member of this cabinet , that we have changed over because , with the problems that he left us with his old pension scheme , we had to find a new one , and that is what we are doing now .
mr speaker , in the face of what we do not see in the news and the motion that was moved by my colleague on that side of the house to the effect that we have not been involved , i want to say that we have been continuously involved for the past four years by way of the taxi task team .
what i want to say is that that hon member is the first person in this house - i am glad i have as much time as possible , with your permission , madam chairperson - to have criticised the fact that the province does not have sufficient revenue of its own , and he continues to do that .
on 4 december 1999 we invited the principals of some of our schools most at risk to a workshop at which we discussed the challenge of time management , and asked them to complete an audit questionnaire that would enable us to determine the extent of this problem at their schools .
let us admit to them that in the apartheid era they too had the short end of the stick , and propose that we link their resources to the nelson mandela secondary school in crossroads and determine how the two schools can cooperate and utilise the resources at their disposal to the best of their ability .
madam chairperson , during the constituency week i paid a visit to two day hospitals , those at site c and site b. the history of these two institutions is one of long queues every day , and whether there will be a doctor to attend to the patients or not is anybody 's guess .
allow me to draw the attention of hon members for a moment to the scene that has unfolded in the provincial parliament over the past two weeks , one that fills the man in the street with distaste and revulsion , a scene that is redolent of unscrupulous politicking with people 's poverty .
i would suggest to the two hon acting ministers that the one thing that did not really come through in the scof meeting and in our liaison - perhaps there is a vacuum there , or at least that is how i understand it - was the whole element of fiscal and financial accountability .
i have been honest and candid , and while that hon member descends again into his political parrot style , it is a pleasure for me to be able to announce that i have recommended that the provincial housing development board transfer the vacant properties in district six belonging to the board to the city of cape town with immediate effect - free , gratis and for nothing .
we cannot keep having motions repeated in the house and satisfying everyone until everyone understands and is heard clearly , whether the fault lies on the side of the hon member who moved the motion or on the side of hon members who listen to it and have to take an immediate decision on the motion .
no , i think it is very much in line with what the np concept was of regional services councils , where we raised levies in the more affluent areas to provide for the areas where the previously disadvantaged individuals stayed , to raise their standards , to uplift , to build better roads and to improve the infrastructure .
i am pleased to see that the pink book also lists allocations for transfer payments to local governments , specifically for biosphere planning , for example , cederberg , the west coast district council areas of knersvlakte , sandveld and swartland , the breede river winelands , the overberg , little karoo district councils and , of course , last but by no means least , the southern cape area .
this piece of road is extremely dangerous , as those who travel that road often will know , because the slopes are so steep at many places that a driver cannot see oncoming traffic , places where many people who do not know the road well have made severe errors of judgement and have forfeited their lives .
what we have is the new np 's hawk who , by his statements and actions , is impacting fundamentally on the abilities of the dove , the hon minister of transport and works , to deal with this matter together with the hon member mr ramatlakane in a way that all of us know it should be dealt with .
mr speaker , in the first place i would like respectfully to suggest that members of the opposition , the anc across the floor there , have been eating too many red jelly beans rather than the other colours , and that is reflected in their speeches , especially that of the hon member mr strachan , who has most probably been overdosing on red jelly beans .
mr speaker , against this background i have had to satisfy myself that the money was used to defray expenditure of an exceptional nature ; it was used to defray expenditure in the public interest ; the expenditure had the desired return ; and all the legal requirements from a financial regularity point of view had been complied with .
an appeal is made to the hon premier to give hope and deliver on promises , to say that there is hope for the future and to say that the deaths of nadia von willingh , jacqueline smit , valencia farmer , basie herman , jordenia sampson , bertie louw and all the others were not in vain .
one cannot necessarily say too much about this , but for the hon premier merely to say that it is the result of the actions of the western cape government that we were able to achieve these successes , is not fitting for a person of his stature , particularly when he claims integrity .
the anc in this area simply refuses to listen to the concerns that many ordinary people raise , and despite their decades of deep loyalty to the liberation struggle , the people of crossroads are now rejecting what they experience as the anc 's authoritarian and undemocratic actions and attitudes in government .
i am grateful and happy that that is what he is going to be doing , because all we wanted him and all the former ministers of social services to do - and we wanted the hon premier to take charge of this - was to follow the example of the hon leader of the opposition .
that the house notes the impact of the drought on farmers of the southern cape / little karoo , and calls on the national minister for agriculture and land affairs to visit the region and make contact with the farmers and workers in the region and to assess the impact of the drought .
it is suggested that this is being defrayed - i hope that is the right word - for the eventuality of possible legal costs , although it has been very difficult to determine what amounts are being talked about and what the potential is for these possible legal costs , and that negotiations are being entered into with the national government .
i therefore repeat again that if blame - and i use the word loosely once again - is to be put on someone for that , i am prepared to take the blame for it , because as far as i am concerned the total amount of r135 million had to be spent in a particular fashion and business plans had to be provided .
if the hon member ms essop has a problem with the bill as it stands - even in her interpretation of clause 5 ( 1 ) , which i think is not correct , but it is her view - then the hon member can try to move an amendment to this as it stands now .
the committee , having heard and considered evidence with regard to various alleged irregularities in the maintenance of buildings , wishes to express its concern at the lack of co-operation by the works branch in supplying documentation to the heath special investigating unit , as well as the apparent deficiencies with regard to the control of expenditure and contract documentation in respect of building maintenance .
the committee , having heard and considered evidence which indicated that the withholding of the pension benefits of personnel in order that outstanding amounts could be recovered had met with varying degrees of success , wishes to recommend the implementation of standardised procedures with regard to the withholding of pension benefits of personnel who are discharged as a result of fraud or misappropriation of state funds .
prof raymond wacks in an article entitled , " judges and injustice " - in actual fact , it was his inaugural lecture - and reported in the sa law journal of 1984 , contends that south african judges are guided by the morality and institutional history of the white community in exercising the choices in law that they have .
that the house notes the impact of the drought on farmers of the southern cape / little karoo , and calls on the national minister for agriculture and land affairs to visit the region and make contact with the farmers and workers in the region and to assess the impact of the drought .
and presented to the director-general , but not yet released publicly ; that such report should be released to the public of the western cape ; and that the house therefore calls for the publication of this report , and for the suspension of the hon member ms adams until such matter has been investigated by the public protector .
i call upon the media , when they are dealing with this kind of violence , and particularly when it is linked to what happened in zimbabwe , to take care and assist us in this country to establish in what way the emphases can be shifted somewhat and do not reinforce negative perceptions outside .
yes , as the hon member mr n m isaacs could also attest , our history is one of injustice , suffering , pain and a lack of human rights if one was brown or black ; yes , the smell of blood is in the air and some people have blood on their hands , but today we are free .
while we on this side of the house condemn racism , we also celebrate the thousands of examples of non-racialism that also characterise our country , such as those i witnessed yesterday when i visited schools for severely disabled learners , where adults of all races are devoting their lives in selfless service to seriously disabled children of all races .
thirdly , such an exclusive focus on race relations between africans and coloureds removes from the debate the reality of black poverty on the one hand - of africans , coloureds and indians - and white privilege on the other hand , the balancing of which is critical to bringing about a society at peace with itself .
there is a complete disregard for that process when ministers come here and say they cannot provide any detail on the expenditure ; they will obtain the information at a later stage ; they can only speculate about where the money went to and what happened to it ; and they will come back to us with written replies .
i am pleased to be able to report to this parliament that for the first time , in accordance with a nationally approved norm largely initiated by this province , a negative amount is now allowed to be voted for a decreased budget allocation , instead of a nominal r1 000 as stipulated in previous years .
my aim is to enable them to make a direct link between the work of the department and an improvement in their experiences , instead of my efforts resulting in a quagmire of bureaucracy that ends up spewing out an endless array of policies that never see the light of day .
that , in view of the recent statistics on the growing resistance to drugs for hiv / aids , the house notes with concern the controversy surrounding the availability of cheaper drugs for hiv / aids , and calls on all the role-players to put the interests of the patients and the south african population first .
here we have the hon member ms brown who is a champion of civil rights and the downtrodden and who is against racism or any tenet of it whatsoever , and when she is confronted with racism , she does not use the instruments at her disposal such as the human rights commission , which her party created and foisted upon the public .
in this department i would like to single out dr stegmann and mr ismay who spent long hours with us in a very difficult process , explaining to some of us - who , like myself , have never seen a government budget in the past - how these things work and the key issues we should be looking for .
we cannot really keep them with us with the salaries we offer them but we are going to do everything in our power to see to it that we train the people correctly and we shall look at the salary structures so that we do not lose these people , too , in the same way that we have lost many other good people .
mr speaker , it is clear to us that voter registration done by this government is another way of trying to use taxpayers ' money to run new np and dp election campaigns and the voters will see right through it , as they did in the june 1999 elections .
mr speaker , in terms of the reports which the hon minister received from the metropolitan local councils as well as the cmc in regard to the availability of land in the blaauwberg structure , would he concede that available state land in the blaauwberg structure is sufficient to meet a large sector of the housing need in this province ?
( 1 ) whether there is a category of tenders defined as ad hoc tenders or tenders which are finalised not through processes prescribed in defined procedures ; if so , ( a ) what tenders these are , ( b ) how many tenders there are and ( c ) under what circumstances have the tenders been applied ;
there were also applications for exemptions from the process and the provisions of the eia regulations , and those figures are for the same period , that we exempted , 541 ; not exempted , 14 ; awaiting review by the department , 147 ; awaiting completion of application process by applicant , 95 ; and a total of 797 applications for exemption .
in my 100-day speech on 16 september 1999 i indicated that it is a key project of the department of finance to redefine the western cape government 's procurement policies and strategies so as to facilitate and enhance the participation of smmes and businesses owned by the previously disadvantaged sectors of our community .
mr speaker , does the answer by the hon minister of local government and development planning , to the effect that no disciplinary proceedings have been called for against this town clerk , mean that the hon minister will tolerate a dishonest person in the position of town clerk , who is in a fiduciary position , entrusted with public money ?
there are also serious problems in respect of the fact that we are being asked to agree to roll-over funds to the tune of almost r8,4 million when , in fact , there is a serious problem with the preferred service provider who has not been able to stick to the terms and conditions of the tender .
( 1 ) whether any bomb threats have been reported to the police in the province for the period january to december 1999 ; if so , ( a ) how many , ( b ) how many have led to arrests , ( c ) how many remain unsolved at the end of the period and ( d ) how many have resulted in successful prosecutions ;
the first phase involved the stabilisation and rationalisation programme to stem the resignation of skilled staff from the department ; optimise and prioritise the use of funds across administration ; and to establish an infrastructure based on common standards to ensure compatibility , communication and deployment of internet and e-mail technologies .
i also believe he is entitled to be annoyed , because , as far as i am concerned , if he spoke to hon members on that side of the house , it would at least be common courtesy for them to come to him before the sitting and say , " michael , we are not supporting it .
prof bengu illustrated this point by referring specifically to the institution he once headed , the university of fort hare , a once great south african university , which has graphically illustrated a trend over many years showing that the resources invested in that institution have been inversely proportional to the educational outputs .
on 2 november 1999 , in response to a question by the hon member mr e isaacs on funds for disability programmes and projects , the hon minister referred to the " establishment of a database " , " the integrated western cape disability strategy " , " a braille output service or audio cassette recordings " , " sign language interpretation services " and so on .
the hon minister will remember - i do find it rather funny , and let me pick up on what the hon member mr isaacs said when he was talking about disaster management - that when you spoke in september 1999 about the wonderful act that you were going to bring out , we told you that you could not do so .
the fear exists , whether well-founded or not , that in the restructuring of the municipalities controlled by the new np or the anc because they are the two largest parties in the province , there could be cases in respect of jobs in which preference is given to the supporters of these parties .
explanatory manuals on the purpose and preparation of integrated development frameworks have been completed and distributed to local authorities throughout the province , and staff of the directorate : regional planning have paid regular visits to local authority areas , where they have attended community meetings to explain the importance of integrated development planning and the role of civil society in compiling such plans .
i am very concerned - and i am actually scared to raise it in this house for fear that some people may take up what i say - that in this province at present people can pass environmental impact assessments and go through a whole process , and thereafter no one will see whether the environmental impact assessments were implemented .
at a time when many of our people are struggling with the coming of democracy , where many people are struggling with transformation , where people are disappointed in their expectations of the new south africa and where people are struggling with unemployment , it is important that we give those same people something that can help to preserve their identity and their human dignity .
madam chairperson , add to that that this week in calitzdorp there is an auction in execution of certain rdp houses , and the story is doing the rounds there that the farmers are queuing to buy up these houses to settle their workers there , in an effort to circumvent the implications of the security of tenure act .
i do not say that people should object to every application , but if a route is already over-full and another operator is added , and if the inspector says that he cannot grant another parking area because the municipality cannot arrange it , then people must understand that that is the reason for the objection .
it is very interesting - and i am tempted to say that it is a pity - that when the hon member mr marais talks nonsense , he gets the kind of support from his white brothers and sisters on that side of the house , but when he does speak about the evils and problems in his party , they shake him a little .
madam chairperson , given the fact that the cabinet made a decision of paying up to r1 000 , and the hon premier says that a different department could have used a different ratio to determine the payment , who was empowered to make the decision around the ratio differences in determining the payment ?
madam chairperson , my recollection relating to this matter , which i cannot confirm because i do not want to be in contempt of the house , is to say to the hon member that as the year goes by one can see whether one has not been able to fill certain posts which one has anticipated filling in the previous year .
that the house notes with dismay reports that the mayor of the cape town unicity has an excessive number of bodyguards , which are far in excess of those allocated to the premier , and that this is a waste of ratepayers ' money , and further calls on the minister of local government and development planning to investigate this matter .
the department has to deal with an imminent situation where people who have been receiving certain grants and relief from the state will as from the end of the financial year on 31 march 2001 , as a result of changes in policy or a shortage of resources , lose the only monthly subsistence they have been receiving .
i think someone should tell the anc as a whole , particularly those hon members , that the anc no longer runs cape town , that the da does care about what local people say and think , and that we will seek to listen to what they say and address their concerns .
mr speaker , although i have never mentioned the racial aspect in the debates in the house before , i want to say that the taxis have always been seen , or are seen , as the only true , acknowledged black empowerment industry , while the bus operators on the other hand are seen as part of the old apartheid regime , which receive subsidies .
mr speaker , at the outset let me make one quick distinction : we should not politicise our quest for solutions and a public transport system that works , but when we are dealing with whether a government is derelict in its duty , as politicians and the official opposition we have to call a spade a spade .
mr speaker , when the hon minister of transport and works replies to the debate , i hope that he is going to recommit himself to the long-term solutions ; that he is going to suggest an ongoing negotiating forum so that we can deal with problems as they arise ; and that he will also speak to the transformation of the local road transportation board .
if one looks at the original bill handled in the standing committee and the bill before the house today - and this is not actually a motivation , but a point of procedure or a request for clarity - one sees that the wording in subsection ( 1 ) has been changed completely .
mr speaker , i would also like the hon minister to state whether he questions the competence of bulelani ngcuka , willie hofmeyr and others who , i would argue , through their deployment and placement in the prosecuting authority , are showing a determination and willingness to seize assets acquired through crime and so on .
the reason i still have respect for the hon minister of transport and works and the hon member mr marais is the fact that they were among the first group who said that we needed a dispensation where the majority of the people of the western cape would not be thrown to the dogs .
they include the small business centre , the ntsika enterprise promotion agency and the khula enterprise finance ltd. these programmes and institutions were founded to increase the delivery capacity of small , medium and micro businesses and to support their infrastructure and absorb a proportion of the risk and expense of investment in the small , medium and micro businesses .
the flexibility of valuation options and competition between municipalities should be accommodated by the bill ; rating policies should be clear , unambiguous and allow no room for bribery or corruption ; and allowances must be made for people living on fixed income , such as pensioners , and those who genuinely cannot afford to pay higher rates .
mr speaker , we would like to ask the dp as well as the hon premier - who is also a resident of the south peninsula and a member of the party that controls it and a party that continually makes noises about corruption at national level - whether they will continue covering up this issue .
we are saying that in terms of this constitution , we question the hon minister 's participation on that board , given that section 136 ( 2 ) ( b ) of the constitution makes it very clear that an mec may not - and these words are for the hon minister 's own interest and clarity - and i quote :
not only did the hon minister of finance , business promotion and tourism declare his financial interests , his shareholdings , and when he had those directorships - he has now resigned , and he is a director of one , which he disclosed to the board and to the premier as well - but he disclosed all of this to the premier .
( 1 ) expresses its sympathy with all those people who have lost family members in the ongoing violence in the middle east and expresses its concern at the heavy-handed actions against ordinary palestinians by the government of israel in its dealing with this conflict ; ( 2 ) supports all attempts by various role-players to achieve a peaceful settlement ; and
suddenly , it would seem , the da supports the freedom charter ; suddenly the da recognises the contribution of chief albert luthuli in this country ; and suddenly former president mandela - whom they sent to jail for 27 years and who , while he was president , faced a continual barrage of attacks from their leadership - is now an angel .
we have a situation in the province where the dp , through the hon minister of education , insulted many african women , not only in the house , but also in the national assembly , when she said that many people simply come to conferences and their only contribution is to go off with " kos " .
i will listen with interest to the way the hon member mr ozinsky and the hon leader of the opposition - and now the hon member mr gabru - explain why these children are being turned into virtual refugees by the anc government in the eastern cape that is apparently so caring and committed to the interests of the poor .
the country will spend - in this province it will be the medical research council and the universities of stellenbosch and cape town - more than r25 million this year on the development of an hiv vaccine alone , and it is hoped that as medical science makes progress against the disease , more affordable and more effective antiviral agents will also become available .
although the metropolitan casino bid fees provided a major injection of capital into fixed capital infrastructure , further augmentation of this sector is dependent on three things - general macroeconomic growth which should positively influence equitable shares to the provinces , increases in provincial own revenue and public / private partnerships to raise capital to address current backlogs .
sir , i also want to take this opportunity to extend my sincere thanks to the hon premier , members of the cabinet , the chairpersons of the committees , the members of scof and the other committees , as well as to you , the heads of departments and their staff , and my committee clerk , for their cooperation in making such a success of this .
( 1 ) whether the west coast district council may sign a legally binding agreement without it being approved by the executive council or a full council meeting ; if not , whether the agreement between the west coast district council and the owners of the houses on the beach at grotto bay regarding vehicle entry to the beach , is legally binding ;
i do , however , believe that there are still some grey areas as to whether the services that we have received from sita have , in fact , been adequate , whether they have been audited properly , whether we are getting value for our money and whether they are billing us correctly and will bill us correctly in the future .
madam chairperson , may i say , first of all , in regard to the chairperson of scof , the hon member mr ismail , that i would like to recommend that we have a fourth language translated because , quite frankly , i would need to bring the hon member mr ozinsky 's dictionary in to be able to follow some of the choice words which he used in his speech .
might i also point out to the hon member mr louis , about the figures cited by me yesterday in regard to the loss of computers and so on , that i believe - i am not sure of this , so i will have to check hansard - that he quoted the figures in millions , whereas they should have been in thousands .
in terms of this agreement the department provided the schools with infrastructure , including good fences and alarms , and the schools undertook to take responsibility for formulating and managing a safety plan and establishing closer relationships with the surrounding community in a partnership to combat crime , violence , abuse and vandalism .
for that reason it is imperative that we ensure that none of our young people is lost to our society and that the full potential of every young person is developed ; including those young people who have lost their way and are giving us problems , and whom we are so quick to conveniently remove from the community .
i am convinced that the schools which have discipline - where the teachers compel respect at all times , are not absent from their classes for their personal or political activities and do not turn a blind eye to pupils slipping away during school hours in order to loiter on the streets and have a culture of learning - are the schools that will perform .
they are to improve service delivery ; to be more accessible to the communities ; to render services in a more developmental manner ; to make greater inputs into the eradication of fraud and corruption ; to transform service delivery from institutional-based delivery to community-based delivery ; and to provide an understanding of population trends in the western cape , and also within south africa .
i would also like to include dr sutcliffe , who has been with us in the last year , and who reminds me daily that to ensure efficient and effective management , one should be able to show care and kindness , and it should be part of and a very important element for our senior civil servants .
i want to put it to the house that despite what the hon minister told us today - i will motivate my statement - that the coalition government , under the leadership of the former minister of housing , mr morkel , and the hon minister of housing have not displayed sufficient political will to comply with section 26 .
after 1994 new acts , such as the local government transition act second amendment act , 1996 ( act 97 of 1996 ) , appeared on the statute book , which compelled municipalities to implement a range of measures to ensure effective service delivery , proper planning and budgeting , sound financial management , accountability to the local electorate and monitoring of performance .
i would firstly like to thank the hon minister of finance and development planning and his department , not only for the comprehensive budget presented to us today , and in scof - and the other evening in the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling - but also for the presentation document that his department prepared for us .
( 1 ) notes with contempt the false allegations by the dp that the anc intends to replace town clerks with party functionaries ahead of the november local elections ; ( 2 ) further notes that this spurious allegation is consistent with dp allegations that their offices were bugged by the national government ;
madam chairperson , if that is the reply , can we conclude - and i am asking the hon minister - that ministers come here , particularly the hon minister of finance and development planning , and treat the house with contempt in terms of not preparing the answers and not getting the information that is required here ?
mr speaker , my appeal is that positive efforts be made to give our farm people a safe environment and that all political parties in this house will support such initiatives and will not permit individuals with hidden agendas to drive a wedge between employers and farm workers in order to disturb good relations .
it is common knowledge that the anc councillors in plettenberg bay have sent the word out to all those who voted da in the last election , and especially the griqua community of kranshoek who also voted da , that they can now forget about getting any support from the council for services or delivery of housing .
they are generale location in france , which operates several centres , particularly in the south of france ; rai in amsterdam , which is one of the oldest companies in the world , which has existed since 1890 and which runs , among others , the very well-known centre in maastricht ; and the nec birmingham , which runs the very successful centre in birmingham .
the committee , while taking cognisance of the corrective steps which are being implemented as well as the appointment of experienced and trained staff , wishes to recommend that , in view of the important role this department plays in the control of the administration 's assets , the finalisation of the property register by 30 september 2000 be afforded the highest priority to achieve the deadline date .
south africa , strangely enough - and this is aberration in the world , and not an indication that it is necessarily a recipe for success - is the only country on earth that has gone to the extent of physically separating powers by having three capital cities - a judicial capital , an executive capital and a legislative capital .
we need to offer incremental services providing the absolute basics for whole communities with top-up extra services available on an individual household basis ; we require better financial management with more effective early warning systems to detect financial problems before they result in bankruptcy ; and we require a stricter and more equal enforcement of rates and service charges .
mr speaker , i move without notice : that the house notes the huge and ever-increasing economic gap between the black elite and the rest of the black community , and requests the anc government to address the more urgent needs of the underprivileged people and not only the special needs of the affluent few .
however , mr speaker , the owners of bookmaker businesses and staff of the racing club who are , by virtue of their duties , in a position to manipulate criteria which influence the result of an event , to cheat or to misrepresent the tax liability of the licence holder , will still , as in the past , be required to be licensed by the board .
the situation existed that if an operator could show that the gambling game had been played in a private dwelling , club house or similar venue , that it had not been conducted for profit and that no one had received payment in respect of the conduct , the activity would amount to " social gambling " and attract no criminal sanction .
] making it still worse is the fact that when there was dissension in the new np concerning mr jacobs ' appointment as the mayor , it was the hon premier who had to take a strong stand to keep things together by saying that everything and every position would remain as it was in the south peninsula municipality .
] according to the law - not only the law of the companies act but the constitution , not only the constitution but the executive members ' ethics act , and not only the act , but the draft executive ethics code drafted by the anc government themselves - there is no conflict of interest .
i said earlier on that one did not need to make any disclosures , but we decided to make those disclosures in the interests of one thing - so that the anc on that side of the house should not ruin or blacken the chances of the convention centre proceeding .
in reply to the hon members messrs lewis and isaacs , it is because of this principle that i believe it is inappropriate to enter into discussions with people that may be involved in this , as one is then sending out a signal that their actions will actually lead one to adjust one 's laws to accommodate that .
we should also go there in winter when it is 5  and the wind and rain come pouring through the houses , and then ask the people what they think the solution is and why they think that some of them engage in such mindless activities as throwing bricks over the bridges and so on .
having made this assertion , let me say it is also no secret that whilst the urban areas of south africa in general , and the western cape in particular , have a number of sports facilities , most of these are located away from the large majority of our people , whilst in the rural areas there is an extreme shortage of sports facilities .
three different ministers of police service and community safety in the previous round ; a lack of transformation in this province , as far as the police service is concerned ; a string of accusations of corruption and racism coming in continually ; resources still not being utilised adequately in areas where the incidence of crime is worst and the need greatest ; in short , the cape flats is on fire .
i ask the anc to use their influence at national level in order to improve the own revenue situation not only for this province but for all nine provinces , because unless we are able to raise that 4,6 % to a meaningful 15 % , we will not be able to do the special things we need to do in this province .
when we see the urgent campaigns and heart-rending appeals from the people of the cape to keep the central parliament in cape town , and we hear that our representations to the city of cape town requesting the fencing off of streets to create an area around our building that is easier to secure have simply been swept off the table ...
madam chairperson , allow me to add my congratulations to those of other speakers who have commended the speaker , as the responsible political office-bearer , as well as the departmental officials , especially the secretary to parliament , mr pretorius , and his small but dedicated staff for the excellent work they have done on the provincial parliament 's budget .
largely thanks to the excellent preparatory work done by the speaker , by you yourself , madam chairperson , and by the parliamentary staff , the budget for parliament had a relatively smooth passage through the rules and internal arrangements committee , with one exception , and i shall come back to this one area of major disagreement later .
( 4 ) whether the provincial constitution imposes a duty on the province to protect the victims of crime ; if so , ( a ) whether he will make a statement on the matter and ( b ) whether the province is willing to shoulder this responsibility when it comes to the release of sexual offenders for self-monitored therapy ;
as a general comment , despite the fact that one sphere of government is not allowed to interfere with the " geographical , functional or institutional integrity of government in another sphere " in terms of inter alia section 41 ( 1 ) ( g ) of the constitution , 1996 , the directorate : land development management has since 1997 performed a facilitating role in that -
i would like to know if it is the intention of this government to write planning legislation in such a way that it can actually be implemented , so that we do not find ourselves in situations where eight years after permission is given no one knows when decisions taken in terms of legislation are in fact going to be implemented ?
mr speaker , i would also like to ask the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation whether it is correct that when a court case is in progress , or when there is a threat of legal action between a national or provincial department and a home-owner , another sphere of government should step in and undermine the position of the government in that process .
in other areas there have also been problems , because at the schools where there had been a plan to close down , the transport was not arranged timeously or adequately and as a result we preferred to keep those schools open until such time as the transport is adequately arranged and on tap so that the children do not have to miss school .
he said - he did not use these words - that there were still instances of " rent-a-black " in joint ventures where the power and equity stayed in the hands of whites , but there was a black face and perhaps even enrichment , which the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism often refers to .
what further infuriates me is when i hear that there was , in fact , money available for the conversion of the shower cubicles into second toilets , but that the council used the money , again used the money , and not for the part of the community for which it was intended , but another part of the community .
" now i want to make the point that there are , of course , many in this administration who have crossed the rubicon , who have , in fact , taken on the agenda of transformation , but we still have a huge majority who find it more important to resist transformation than to take it on as a challenge and see it as an inevitability .
mr chairperson , the appeal i want to make to the hon minister and the department is to really investigate where these library resources are and to make an effort to distribute the library services to where they are really needed in an effective and purposeful way and with the necessary political will .
it has been allocated as follows : health , 14 projects amounting to r10 million ; welfare , 1 project amounting to r2,5 million ; education , 28 projects amounting to r39,2 million ; agriculture , 3 projects amounting to r3,9 million ; environmental and cultural affairs and sport , 15 projects amounting to r6,5 million ; and general provincial buildings , 15 projects amounting to r22,7 million .
if central government continue to frustrate the western cape in our efforts to tackle crime effectively , it is perhaps time that the western cape provincial parliament decide to advise the hon premier to dissolve the department of safety and security , thereby denying central government a scapegoat for their own inefficiencies .
i believe that one of the solutions on the road that we who sit here must follow , is that we must go out into our communities and , across political affiliations , take hands and begin to build networks and structures in the communities that we live in and see whether we cannot assist in establishing a human rights culture .
as long as the children on the cape flats , the children in the townships and the children on the farms cannot go to school free of fear , as long as the children cannot play in playgrounds without fear , and as long as mothers wonder whether their children or husbands will come home safely , we cannot speak about true freedom .
an increase in the police budget of 8 % , plus r1,1 billion spread over two financial years , as against a total budget of r14,5 billion , is not a budget that can combat crime in the country particularly if we bear in mind that we have a shortage of many thousands of policemen who have to be appointed to make up the backlog .
on behalf of all the voters who were involved in the final round through the officials of the western cape province the new np says - and it is as full of life as it always has been , and we shall continue to play such a strong role in the future of the western cape - that it is grateful to the officials who protected the constitutional rights of our voters .
madam chairperson , since the hon minister of housing seems to be far more informed about where the money comes from - because it deals with housing and planning - we would like to ask the hon minister from which programmes or subprogrammes the amount of r30 192,91 came and how it was divided between housing and planning ?
the budget is a sizeable one , but i am convinced that we have to use our best endeavours to see if we cannot find other alternative methods of helping our poor communities to sustain themselves with the various multipurpose community centres where people are being trained and educated in various skills which are being funded partly by donor countries and donor agencies .
one can look at this crisis through the eyes of many of the parties - and i feel particular empathy for the bus drivers who have been risking their lives - but today i want to address this question from the perspective of the children and their parents for whom the disruption and the trauma has been very significant .
mr speaker , i have heard only part of what the leader of the house said here today , and it reminded me of an article in the sa law journal of november 1988 , in which dr christopher forsyth labelled the decisions of the highest court of appeal in security cases during the 1980s as " the sleep of reason " .
municipal demarcation act , 1998 ( act no 27 of 1998 ) .
that the house expresses its condolences with the family , friends and comrades of the late fred carnessen who was , as a member of the communist party representing langa , a member of the provincial council during the nineteen fifties , and further notes his active role in the struggle for liberation , democracy and non-racism which will not be forgotten .
mr kruser , the new np chairperson of the executive committee who resigned a few days ago , and the ceo of the council , mr koekemoer , on numerous occasions stated in the press , on the radio and in council meetings that the issues raised in the report had been dealt with and there was no reason for further investigation .
i have also read the media reports on the matter and they amount to the following : firstly , an allegation that there is a conflict of interest ; secondly , a quote from the constitution , section 136 ; and , thirdly , a reference in the debate today to the executive members ' ethics act , act 82 of 1998 .
however , the question is : do i regard the 40 years of business experience i have gained as being an albatross around my neck not to be used for the benefit of the province , or do i become completely and utterly emasculated because i have a weak opposition that have nothing better to do than see ghosts where ghosts do not exist ?
besides extraordinary levels of serious violent crime in our province , including the brutal murder - which the hon member mr byneveldt referred to - of at least five young girls and other children in various parts of the cape in recent weeks , many innocent civilians and officials of the state have become targets of the urban terror campaign .
it emerges out of a perspective of struggle - and i had this debate with the hon minister of education some time ago - which sees the main evil of apartheid as a civil rights evil , that the defining problem of apartheid was that it divided people on race and then put that division onto the statute book .
there are enough south africans who prefer the vision of one nation growing in prosperity and united by peaceful commerce and a common vision , to the tired and defeatist analysis of the anc that we are mired in two racially antagonistic nations - a line that has been used yet again in the debate over the last day .
] in all these towns the voters ensured , by the choice they made at the polls , that bad government would now come to an end. the da , with its new approach of prosperity for all , openness , fiscal discipline and proven leadership , will see to it that the damage done by the anc in these towns is repaired and not repeated .
mr speaker , the failure of the anc everywhere in government hangs like a millstone around the neck of the hon leader of the opposition in the western cape , because it is a simple matter for the people of our province to compare and contrast the quality of government in the western cape with the disastrous governments in anc-controlled provinces .
as regards the questions for written reply of the hon member mr ismail , i want to remind the hon member that if a minister does not answer questions in writing in time , the rules specify a procedure whereby the hon member can put them in the house as questions for oral reply to compel the minister to answer the questions .
whether he , with his undertaking to the cape high court on 6 june 2000 regarding the redeployment of three police officers stationed in claremont , fully considered the statutory or other authority and powers entrusted to him to act in such manner ; if so , whether he will make a statement regarding such authority and powers ?
whether he visited vredendal on 26 november 1999 at the invitation of the municipality of vredendal during the opening of the common grounds project for the empowerment of disadvantaged small farmers ; if so , whether he expressed himself in favour of the project ; if not , why not ; if so , what steps did his department take to actively support the project ?
( 1 ) how many disabled persons are presently employed in the provincial administration : western cape , in view of the white paper on an integrated national disability strategy released by the disability desk in the office of the former deputy president , which called for representation of disabled persons in national , provincial and local government departments ;
mr speaker , regarding criteria , could the hon minister of economic affairs and tourism give us an indication of how much emphasis has been placed on empowerment with respect to the framework and criteria for the sale of provincial assets , and whether or not empowerment has been applied to any of the sales or rentals that have been put in place up to now ?
in regard to the staff and what he quoted as being imbalances in the staff of finance , i want to make it absolutely clear that i believe that history , whether recent or distant , needs to be used in order to correct policies of the past that were incorrect or perhaps were not implemented as they should have been .
mr chairperson , in particular it is crucial for them to understand that nominating educators to fill posts - and the anc would do well to listen to this and wake up the hon member mr mckenzie - is the most important function a governing body undertakes and it must be done with the educational interests of children in mind .
] the minister in the office of the premier : madam chairperson , to begin with i want to thank the hon member dr van zyl , ms brown and messrs winde , louis and isaacs for the positive contributions they have made and compliment them on the way in which they have dealt with the portfolio of social services , and also parts of the poverty relief issue .
] i have said , and i have given my word on many occasions in this house over the past years , that if this is the incorrect version and the version that the hon member ms essop has given in the house is correct , i will find the official and give him hell in the house .
that the house notes with concern that the target date of 1999 for acceptable representation of staff in the provincial administration which was set in 1996 has now quietly been shifted to 31 december 2002 , thereby showing the staff of the provincial administration and the people of the western cape that the provincial government is not serious about transformation .
( 2 ) further expresses its concern with the decision of the premier to refer an investigation into possible misappropriation of state funds with regard to orthopaedic and prosthetic devices to an internal investigation rather than the heath commission , which has resulted in a delay of more than two years and could result in a possible loss of state funds .
madam chairperson , given the reply that , in fact , there were four people who were deployed from that office at a cost of r1 000 for the work done , could the hon premier then indicate to us whether this was the standard amount given to all those civil servants deployed during this particular period ?
madam chairperson , my question is , given the fact that he now has the information at his disposal that this province should have organised volunteers to assist with voter registration and not necessarily paid those volunteers , that it was this province 's decision to go the route of payment , unlike the rest of the country , ...
the truth is that the da and the provincial government , with all its failings - and i am more conscious of our failings than the hon leader of the opposition is - delivers better to the support base of the anc in this province , than anc governments deliver to their own support base in provinces which they control .
mr speaker , it is good to see in the newspapers that the bus operators have publicly denounced violence , but we call on all the taxi operators to publicly denounce violence - and not denounce violence only in the office of the hon minister of transport and works , but publicly .
one should see what has happened between the tabling of the motion and now in the light of the hon member mr mckenzie 's warning in it months ago that the new np should assert its leadership over the coalition , allow its members to publicly condemn dp attacks on them and prevent instability within the new np .
any national regulatory framework for rating in south africa should ensure that rates are levelled fairly , efficiently and at the lowest possible cost , but it must be left to individual municipalities to choose between the options of a flat tax , a composite system or the system that we prefer - rating on the site value of a property before improvements .
by allowing municipalities in effect to levy a lower property rate in previously disadvantaged communities , the bill recognises that although a society which affords each human being equal treatment - and that is the goal of the anc government - it cannot be achieved by insisting upon identical treatment in all circumstances before that goal is achieved .
when the hon premier plants a tree as a symbolic action against racism , we hope that his symbolism will go beyond the planting of that tree , and that he will start acting where he finds that there is serious racial discrimination , as well as racist attitudes and prejudices being perpetuated and still supported by members on that side of the house .
according to the auditor-general 's report the department applied to the western cape provincial tender board for ex post facto approval for the non-compliance with the tender board 's conditions and procedures with regard to certain contracts for the rendering of security services at various schools for the period 1 september 1995 to 31 december 1999 , which had been entered into in terms of delegations under emergency conditions .
expenditure constraints include the system of central bargaining which results in rising salary and wage rates , a staff establishment legacy which is still difficult to overcome due to the limited scope for managing personnel costs , and the ongoing problem of unfunded mandates when new functions and responsibilities are devolved to us without a proper and sustained matching commitment of funding resources .
in short , we on this side of the house believe that south africa must choose between two models of change , one which focuses on race and uses racial categories and considerations exclusively ; and another which focuses on individuals , the disadvantages they suffer because of past discrimination , and ways in which to make up the deficits that are a result of that discrimination .
] however , these powers may be more illusionary than real , because closer scrutiny of the rules reveals that they are limited by the power conferred on the speaker acting in consultation with the rules and internal arrangements committee to subject the exercise of the powers of the committees or a particular committee to certain prohibitions , restrictions and conditions .
whether he attended a meeting at the offices of the south african national parks ( sanp ) in knysna during the provincial cabinet 's visit to the southern cape on 16 and 17 november 1999 ; if so , ( a ) in what capacity and what was discussed and ( b ) whether any employees of the provincial administration of the western cape were present ?
there are other building blocks in policy , like the way the tender board procedures could be simplified and the tender board could become far more accessible to small black businesses ; looking at the details of the contracts ; and looking at how specifications are drawn up and how at the point of specifications certain businesses are already locked out of the system .
mr speaker , in the light of the unnecessary violence perpetrated towards mcdonald 's , our fellow capetonians and their children over the weekend following the middle east protest at the green point stadium , what role does the hon premier see the provincial government playing in bringing about an atmosphere of religious tolerance and understanding in the province ?
( b ) the national departments of justice and health , as well as the saps , are equipped to deal with rape victims , and prevent incidents such as the one of the eight-year-old girl who was raped in kwazulu-natal on 7 march 2000 and who waited for four hours to be attended to by the district surgeon , who first treated the rapist .
what i wanted to say is that the hon member mr louis can testify that when he came to my office with the proposed motion which i asked him to change , i said to him , " michael , the first thing that comes to mind is that i am going to tell you that it is a waste of time .
i therefore want , firstly , to appeal to the elderly - that is , those 65 years of age and older - high-risk patients , people with chronic diseases such as diabetes , asthma , heart disease and lung disease , chronic smokers with chronic bronchitis or emphysema , those suffering chronic renal disease and the immuno-suppressed to be vaccinated against the flu as soon as possible .
the above-mentioned assumption of this office is furthermore motivated by the content of chapter 2 of the copenhagen declaration on social development , eradication of poverty , which was drawn up in copenhagen during 1995 just prior to the united nations fourth world conference on women , where poverty alleviation was identified by almost all affiliated members as the top priority to address .
it has moved from where it was in our first year in the house , where the department was steeped in patronage from the old apartheid days and had to administer a fragmented social welfare system based on very narrow racist practices , to today where i feel the department has started meeting the needs of the poor and vulnerable .
that the house notes with serious concern the sewage spillage that , once again , occurred at the sunvlei sewage works outside macassar , and further notes the serious impact it has on the environment and community , and calls on all relevant provincial departments to put pressure on local government to find a solution .
the hon ministers of economic affairs and tourism , and of community safety , sport and recreation , and the hon member mr silke cannot speak out about this matter because of their background of being in the privileged class who have no history of addressing the plight of the poor people in this country , especially in the western cape .
before making regulations under subsection ( 1 ) , the minister must cause a notice to be published in the gazette , and in a newspaper circulating in the declared area and may consult with transport consultative forums established in terms of regulations to this act or other transport legislation applicable to the province of the western cape , stating ...
i call to mind chantine veldsman - shot and killed before her parental home ; clive mohammed - shot and killed in his bed ; deogan petersen - shot and killed in a playground ; and his sister tried in vain to get him out of the way of the bullets and she was shot in the head and as we speak here is fighting for her life in tygerberg hospital .
that the house expresses its concern about the increase in violence in the province , and in particular the escalating gang-related violence on the cape flats , and further calls on both provincial and national authorities as well as all community leaders to urgently address the current scourge of violence and to specifically investigate gang-related activity in the prisons of the western cape .
] how seriously will they take them when they know that the hon minister of education goes into the director-general 's meeting and says , " i want the police and the army mobilised now " , and a few hours later it is done , but they shut up when a fundamental crisis unfolds in places like khayelitsha and nyanga ?
the icc in durban estimates that since its opening - and i must say it is an extremely well-run conference centre and one should respect them for what they have done - the centre has already in its one and a half years of operation injected about r800 million into the region .
i would like to forewarn the hon minister and hon members in the house who did not want to look at the shareholders ' agreement that there is a draft municipal finance bill , similar to the public finance management act , which has not yet been published - it will be published only on friday - which retrospectively outlaws investments by municipalities .

the committee , having heard and considered evidence which indicated that journals were not always supported by proper documentation and information by most of the departments , wishes to recommend that the attention of financial staff of all departments of the administration again be drawn to the requirements with regard to the proper compilation of journal entries in order that the true financial position of the administration is reflected in its books .
mr van schalkwyk must choose - and it will take an enormous amount of courage to make this choice - whether the new np is going to pretend to be a truly national organisation essentially of whites and coloureds , or a regional organisation incorporating especially the western cape and the northern cape , essentially an organisation of coloured people and coloured interests .
that the house expresses its concern that the dp councillor , yvonne woods , who admitted saying that the mouths of coloured people are filthy and that coloureds breed like rabbits , remains a councillor of the south peninsula municipality and continues to draw a salary , and that this strengthens the perception that the new np / dp coalition protects unashamed racists .
i therefore ask that we be helped to give all the citizens of the province a better life ; that we should all pay our rates ; and that we should all be proud enough to say that we are paying a rate which is justified , so that service delivery can take place not only in all the townships , but in the entire city of cape town .
the test that we have to pass on both sides of the house , at a time when there is a very grave risk that our community will be divided on religious lines in particular , is to see to it that there is no greater split in our community and that we in fact remain the mouthpieces for our entire community and keep them together .
mr speaker , if hon members on that side of the house care to look at the current opinion poll statistics on whether black anc supporters actually support affirmative action , they will find that 52 % of their own supporters now do not support affirmative action and , in fact 52 % now support merit-based options for south africa .
what does the farm worker say whose head was held under water ; the one in albertinia who was hanged upside down in a shed ; the one who was dragged behind a van ; the one who was struck with a spoke from an ox wagon ; the one who was assaulted with a pistol ; and the many other people who experience racism every day in the rural areas in the cape ?
the anc will be putting up information tables and a petition in claremont and newlands to appeal to and engage with the large numbers of people in those communities who want to reach out , who want to build bridges , who want to build non-racialism , who are afraid of the danger that the da wishes to wipe away with a magic wand the problem of racism , the problem of divisions .
mr speaker , i thank the hon premier for never failing to address the required chapter xi , section 198 ( a ) of the constitution , from which we can derive that security is the collective responsibility of all peace-loving citizens across political divides , and which implies maximum policing powers to the provinces .
as the hon member mr louis pointed out , the premier of a province is the representative and personalisation of that province 's inhabitants , just as our head of state is in relation to the country as a whole . the premier is a person who , as a consequence of his position , can count on the respect and regard of his electorate , irrespective of which political party he belongs to .
my colleagues and i have seen and listened and heard the voice of the people who have suffered at the corrupt and incompetent hand of the anc ; and having done so , let met tell those hon members this : if they want to unleash the dogs of racism against us , we will unleash the lions of truth against them .
madam chairperson , in spite of all the nice things that the speaker told us about in his speech , in spite of all the things that we have got for our parliament and for which we are very grateful , and in spite of all the improvements , we are still by far the most effective , cost-saving parliament of all the provinces in south africa .
speaking about vote 2 , we should say that for the first time vote 2 has been subjected to a zero-based budgeting process , and in this regard i think we should commend the officials for the good work they have done in starting the budget from scratch and trying to establish what the needs of parliament are .
mr speaker , on a point of order : i refer you to rule 44 of our standing rules , which states that a member should be allowed to deliver his speech without being interrupted , except in the case of a point of order being raised or a matter of privilege arising , or on account of the presence of strangers in the house .
mr chairperson , just yesterday when the principal and governing body of phakama high school in crossroads put guards at their gate and tried to enforce an agreement to prevent students leaving the premises during school hours , students stoned the principal 's car and created mayhem that required police intervention to control .
during the past financial year , in partnership with works - and i would like to thank the department and the hon minister of transport and works very sincerely - r45 million was spent on building or completing the following six new schools , namely driftsands primary , harry gwala secondary , khayelitsha secondary , zinsa secondary , zola secondary and encotsheni primary .
four schools of skills will open in atlantis , oudtshoorn , paarl and in pacaltsdorp ; a new school for learners with special educational needs will open in george ; four youth care and education centres will open in faure , george , ottery and wellington ; and two special youth care centres - i prefer to call them secure care centres , because that is what they are - will be functional in rawsonville and tokai .
sir , allow me the opportunity to indicate , with reference to some examples - i hope you will allow me the time today - to show what methods we could use , requiring an underlying political will , to stretch our budget a little and in the process help to bring the communities , schools and institutions in the western cape together in a real sense .
they are public awareness and education ; training ; early intervention - and this is very important - and prevention programmes with the focus on family reintegration and family strengthening ; a 24-hour service , which includes the emergency placement of children ; a database - we are busy with that now - to track the movement of children in the system ; and more research , monitoring and evaluation .
mr chairperson , i think it would be instructive for us to note , as we have heard the announcement from the hon minister of housing that the provincial land in the district six area is going to be released to the cape town municipality , that there is a great sense of excitement throughout our country and our province as the land restitution process begins to gather momentum .
that the house , on the eve of world tuberculosis day , notes the alarming increase in the prevalence of tb to 600 per 100 000 people in the western cape over the last two years , and therefore resolves that the tuberculosis emergency declaration which was so successful in 1997 be reintroduced in the western cape to meet the challenge of tb .
madam chairperson , i now move to the tourism green paper which was published on 27 september 1999 as a discussion document aimed at providing direction on the strategic imperatives for western cape tourism and a framework for synergising and directing efforts of the various players , public and private , in the tourism industry in the province .
after an in-depth analysis relating to the department of agriculture in the first term of the government , from 1994 to 1999 , as well as a review of the current agricultural budget that serves the rural community , including the proposed policy on the settlement of farm workers , it is quite clear that the strategy in the western cape is aimed at duplicating the historic patterns of agriculture .
we felt that section 30 ( 1 ) ( l ) of the road transportation act , 1977 ( act 74 of 1977 ) deals extensively with the whole issue of seizing of motor vehicles and that we should not insert a separate clause regarding the impounding of vehicles , but just extend the definition of section 30 ( 1 ) ( ( l ) .
what the minister essentially said - and it would need the support of this house and hopefully the hon minister of agriculture , property management and works as well - is that there are farmers who have refused access to inspectors of the department of labour to ascertain whether child labour and also other forms of abuse are being practised on farms .
( a ) notwithstanding the tender board 's recommendations , the administration proceeded with the purchase of the equipment ; ( b ) the matter was not referred back to the tender board as a matter of urgency when the latter 's decision of 15 july 1997 was brought to its attention and was only reacted to after the office of the auditor-general queried the matter ;
7.2 the committee wishes to express its extreme dismay that the state attorney in conjunction with the appointed counsel , is not taking decisive steps towards the finalising of this matter and wishes to expresses its concern over the possible loss to the administration due to the prescription of any claim that may be made in respect of recovery of the amount .
7.3 the committee therefore recommends that the head of the department enter into high level liaison and discussions with the office of the state attorney in order that immediate steps be taken to afford this matter proper priority and that a report on the progress in this regard be submitted to the committee within 30 days of the date of this report .
that the house , noting that the national union of metalworkers of sa has called for the anc to be removed as the leading party in the tripartite alliance due to its unsatisfactory performance in the various spheres , therefore concludes that the tripartite alliance is becoming increasingly dysfunctional to the detriment of governance in south africa .
what further worried us was that although the ceo insisted that he would not show the audit to anyone - and he has not shown it to anyone - mr kruser , the then new np executive committee chairperson , told the argus that he had seen the report and found no evidence of any irregularities .
in addition , section 3 ( a ) and ( b ) of the intergovernmental fiscal relations act 1997 provides that the budget council is the body where national and provincial governments consult on " any fiscal , budgetary or financial matter affecting the provincial sphere of government " and " any proposed legislation or policy which has a financial implication for the provinces .
that the house notes with concern that learners once again had to be sent home on 8 february 2001 because of gang activities and that as a result thereof another school day was disrupted , and calls on the minister of community safety to immediately and as a matter of urgency attend to the problem and report on the matter as soon as possible .
so i asked him whether he wanted us to arrest those people , hold them for two or three days over the weekend , because that is invariably when the people get drunk , take them to the courts and tie up police officers and vehicles , only to be told by the prosecutors that they were not going to take the case .
when one links this to the percentage of the budget allocated to the economic development vote then that gives one food for thought , namely that a development in the province that could specifically help us to generate funds by way of economic development , tourism and so on , receives something like 3 % of the overall budget .
using the provincial human development index - i am sure hon members have all seen that index - which ranks residential groupings by census place names in terms of poverty and their vulnerability to poverty , it was found that 32 of the highest 115 are located in the mitchells plain magisterial district , 9 in the north west of the province and 17 in the karoo and klein-karoo regions .

mr speaker , eventually that person influenced those people to such an extent that despite the fact that that employer wanted to go and negotiate with the workers at the anc office , and despite the fact that the woman from beaufort west pleaded with them to return to the farm , he refused to let the farmer negotiate with them again to return to the farm .
their traditional supporters are sick and tired of the broken promises ; they are sick and tired of the lack of jobs which were promised in 1994 ; they are sick and tired of the high crime levels in spite of the hiding of the actual figures ; and they are sick and tired of the all-pervasive corruption - even within the ranks of the anc .
( 1 ) an albertinia farmer , who has been charged with attempted murder , kidnapping and assault for allegedly tying a rope to the feet of a sixteen-year-old child and then hanging this child up from the roof of a shed on the farm , appeared in the riversdale magistrate 's court on 19 june 2000 and was released on r2 000 bail ; and
sunwest did indeed pay the r135 million to the province , but there had been an amendment of the cabinet 's earlier decision , so that the r135 million could also be spent on other issues , and in the event the greatest beneficiary of that was the hon minister of transport and works through construction and the department of education and others through social services .
the committee , having heard and considered evidence with regard to the fact that prescribed annual stocktakings were not carried out at all institutions of the department , wishes to recommend that the department insures that all institutions under its control undertake stocktakings in terms of the prescriptions and in the event of inability to comply therewith , proper planning of stocktakes in conjunction with treasury be undertaken .
( 1 ) notes with shock and horror the extremely cruel manner in which basie herman and jordenia samson were killed in dysselsdorp over the weekend of 26 to 27 august 2000 ; ( 2 ) expresses its condolences and sympathy with the families and next of kin of the above-mentioned two persons and wishes them strength in this dark hour ;
mr speaker , i approved a request from the speaker of the house in terms of section 7 of the western cape exchequer law that the provision for the constituency allowance payable to political parties be increased by r168 000 to r2,4 million to accommodate an increase from r4 500 to r4 833 per member per month as from 1 april 2000 .
] but when people of colour in this country and this province decided to align themselves with the new np , we did not allow that past history of ours to cripple our vision to come together collectively to work out something for a better south africa , not only for us but for our children and grandchildren .
viewed by the industrial development corporation as the region with the second highest growth prospects for the 1998-2001 period - 3 % per annum , compared to 3,4 % for mpumalanga and below 2,5 % for the other seven provinces - its share in idc activities in the country over the past five years has been 23,7 % by number of investment projects and 42 % by investment value .
if i were to summarise , in a few lines , my comparison of this year 's budget with that of last year , i would say that , having applied stern fiscal discipline during the past year , we have succeeded in crafting a budget for the next financial year which should reinforce our position as the country 's leading province in so many respects .
mr speaker , thank you very much for the honour of giving feedback as chairperson of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling today , for the first time , and for the first time in this millennium , on the western cape appropriation bill , [ b 5--2000 ] as introduced by the hon minister of finance , development planning and gambling referred to by the speaker to the relevant committee .
madam chairperson , it is also important for us in future - we might not be able to do so now - to investigate the kind of salary we pay administrative personnel , so that we can retain the expertise that we have built up here over the years , and not lose it to the private sector , which could attract those people with better salaries .
whether the provincial government has commissioned the compilation of an objective and definite report of the province 's tourism facilities and services and the quality of such facilities and services ; if so , when ; if not , whether the provincial government intends commissioning such a report ; if not , why not ; if so , what are the relevant details ?
in view of our poor economic circumstances and the consequences this entails for choirs of this calibre and the fact that they are real ambassadors for our province , does the hon premier envisage that it might be possible for us to accord them recognition in some way which may give them a financial incentive to continue to compete at the level at which they are at present ?
whether the provincial government has commissioned the compilation of an objective and definite report of the province 's tourism facilities and services and the quality of such facilities and services ; if so , when ; if not , whether the provincial government intends commissioning such a report ; if not , why not ; if so , what are the relevant details ?
it is a terrible thing to say , but if one is going to be sick in south africa , one may as well be sick in the western cape , because , according to statistics from the health systems trust , the western cape has the highest distribution of health personnel per 10 000 of the population , in terms of doctors , nurses , dentists and pharmacists , compared with all the other eight provinces in south africa .
i am sure that people who have been ministers and not mecs previously are fully aware of the fact that they cannot know everything that goes on in the administration and they have to be able to apply their minds based on information given to them by officials and on occasions to ask officials questions in order to test those figures given .
- i will answer the hon member 's question - of what this house heard , that they would be paid approximately r1 000 per month , i would say approximately 18 people would then have been employed in social services to assist with registration , but i could be wrong if the amount of r1 000 per month is not correct .
madam chairperson , since this is a finance act and we are dealing with the detailed schedules , could the hon minister indicate to the house whether or not he has organised that his officials , who are able to feed him with this information and the details here today on this particular matter , have been asked to be here to assist the him with these questions ?
madam chairperson , following up on my previous question , and given that the hon minister of transport and works has had no commitment to get this money reimbursed , meaning that this important department has lost r36 000 , is he satisfied that he has sacrificed r36 000 in this financial year and will he not run out of money before the end of the financial year ?
the vulnerable in this province also include the youth who , with great ceremony , we dispatch from our schools , certificate in hand , and we return most of them to the ghettos where the only meaning in life will come from the competition they have with one another about who can more brutally force their way up the gang hierarchy .
that the house expresses its condolences to the family of the golden arrow bus driver , michael magadlela , who was fatally shot , and condemns this barbaric action , and calls on the provincial government , in particular the saps under the leadership of the minister of community safety , sport and recreation , to protect the communities from violence and intimidation , and to bring the perpetrators to book .
] they undoubtedly must also have realised that they could not expect us to agree here to a piece of legislation based on a shareholder agreement when we had not had the opportunity to peruse it thoroughly and obtain proper answers from the hon minister in regard to some of the matters about which we have certain concerns , and had at that stage .
that the house , in view of the alleged malpractices at the prince albert hospital with regard to management style , leave , promotions , appointments , salary scales and discrimination regarding tasks such as the cleaning of the mortuary , requests the provincial minister of health to investigate the recent allegations of racism and specifically the unequal adjudication of staff members at the hospital and to report to the house as soon as possible .
sir , indeed , proof of this is the restructuring of local government via the local government : municipal structures act , which not only serves to shape south african cities into large bureaucratic and potentially inefficient megacities , but also wishes to confer on our local structures all-powerful executive mayors that can rule the roost like dictators without any direct political accountability to the very people who elect them .
hon members will recall that mr theron was assassinated last thursday , a week ago , and on the friday morning i phoned my national counterparts , the minister of safety and security and the minister for justice and constitutional development , and told them that we could not continue with the security of our justice officials in the uncoordinated manner in which it was currently taking place .
it seeks also to persuade blacks not to pursue equality , or even equity , and accuses the very victims of racial inequality of being racists for trying to redress those inequalities and implement mechanisms such as affirmative action , employment equity and many others as efforts at re-racialising society , as if society had been deracialised in the first place after 1994 .
( 2 ) deplores the fact that groups / organisations , six years after the arrival of democracy in our country , and despite the fact that they even sometimes declare that human rights must be maintained , still cannot accept that people have the right to freedom of association and also have the right to decide to which political party they want to belong ;
( 1 ) an albertinia farmer , who has been charged with attempted murder , kidnapping and assault for allegedly tying a rope to the feet of a sixteen-year-old child and then hanging the child up from the roof of a shed on the farm , appeared in the riversdale magistrates ' court on 19 june 2000 and was released on r2 000 bail ; and
if in the course of the inquiry it is found that this farmer is indeed a member of organised agriculture in the western cape , then that will send a very clear message that it is not only this house that is prepared to isolate certain farmers who give other farmers a bad name , but that agriculture in the western cape is prepared to take a stand on this specific matter .
( a ) obtain clarity whether such cases , where the required approval / exemption had not been obtained , should be treated as unauthorised expenditure and who the final authority is in terms of the local government transition act , 1993 , to consider the possible approval of such unauthorised expenditure and what the basis for the determination of the amount for the recovery of such overpayments is ;
the standing committee on economic development , having considered the subject of the tourism amendment bill , [ b 50f-99 ] ( ncop ) , referred to the legislature in terms of the rules of the national council of provinces ( ncop ) , begs to report that it confers on the western cape 's delegation in the ncop the authority to support the bill .
i want to ask this house whether it is fair to the citizens of this province for us to hear from the hon leader of the opposition that we , the cabinet on this side of the house , including my colleagues in the dp , have basically done nothing correct at all since june 1999 , and that we have actually failed in everything we have done .
the establishment of a component to provide training in the field of staff management to functionaries of the administration , for which the amount of r1,5 million has been allocated ; the development of dozens of policy frameworks in terms of the public service regulations of 1999 ; the revision of all human resource practices ; the building up of a network with other major employers and tertiary institutions in the western cape ; and the optimisation of service delivery .
communication services delivers professional communication services to the departments in the following functional areas : media liaison for those departments that do not have capacity in this regard ; publications , which include personnel newsletters , annual reports , flyers and posters ; rendering a language service in the three official languages of the province ; rendering marketing and promotional assistance to the departments ; and providing support regarding internal communication between management and personnel .
madam chairperson , the hon minister in the office of the premier has a budget of r4,4 million to fulfil four crucial development programmes , namely the establishment of departmental and provincial gender structures ; the formulation of guidelines and policy ; education and training programmes ; communication strategy ; and awareness raising campaigns.the only worked out programme thus far is a special project for the protection , promotion and the enhancement of the rights of persons with disabilities .
mr speaker , given the recent firing by the hon premier of rev bantom on the basis of moral conduct , and in the light of recent allegations of inappropriate conduct by the driver of the former minister in the office of the premier , what actions will he be taking and can we expect these actions a year later , as seems to be his practice ?
( 2 ) the department has on several occasions confirmed - and communicated it as such to the west coast regional council that manages the area concerned - that all activities that take place on the beach and adjoining areas and that may negatively impact on any sensitive biota , not only the black oyster catcher , must be conducted with great discretion , for instance in the control of access for 4x4 vehicles .
it asks how many contracts have been awarded and to whom ; what the policies and criteria applied for procurement were , specifically in that instance ; if there is compliance or not , as the hon minister of finance and development planning has promised this house ; and whether migrant labour or labour from another province has been used , and if so , under what conditions , and if not , what the nature of the problem is .
i saw in him a person with a sincere compassion for the community he serves , and a person who is prepared on a 24-hour basis to devote his all to improving the lot of his community with the utmost dedication ; yes , even a person who would not hesitate to arrest a man who threw a cigarette but out of the window of a moving vehicle .
mr speaker , i sincerely hope that all hon members have had a well deserved rest and that they are keen to continue where they left off in the last century with delivery in terms of our 2020 vision , as we promised our people during the 1999 election and will as politicians undoubtedly promise our people during the local government elections scheduled for november 2000 .
that the house notes with grave concern the continuing deaths of innocent children caught in the crossfire of gang-related violence , and further condemns the loss of four young lives over this last week , and calls on the national minister of safety and security to immediately address the lack of a police station in bonteheuwel which serves to aggravate the current situation .
poverty impacts on children from poor families in all parts of their lives , for example , not having at least one nutritious meal per day ; living in an overcrowded house ; no money for school fees ; perhaps an abusive alcoholic parent ; and the chances of perhaps becoming a child prostitute are very great .
as applications of this type are at present being assessed on a more or less ad hoc basis by the department , problems are being experienced in approving such applications , as they relate to the number of dwellings , clustering versus linear positioning of units , setback development lines from the high-water mark , sizes of erven and actual houses , fragmentation of the natural areas and the management of the remaining natural areas .
following the receipt of lengthy legal opinions from senior counsel and consultations with affected parties , it has become clear to me that the original decision to rezone that property was inconsistent with recent developments in this field of law , and that there thus exists a basis to review and set aside the decision approving the application for rezoning .
very often - i am sure hon members on that side of the house will agree with me - one develops a certain perception of people , for example that they are doing a bad job , are biased or whatever . however , i can say without fear of contradiction that my former cynical view of that department , from a local government perspective , was totally and utterly incorrect .
mr speaker , i sincerely hope that all hon members have had a well deserved rest and that they are keen to continue where they left off in the last century with delivery in terms of our 2020 vision , as we promised our people during the 1999 election and will as politicians undoubtedly promise our people during the local government elections scheduled for november 2000 .
mr speaker , that is why the point made by the hon member mr marais regarding the unicity and municipal policing is so valid , because that is the only mechanism left if government is not prepared to fulfil its role of keeping a safe and secure environment - which , i may say , is entrenched in the constitution .
we also know that by making a difference in the rendering of social services and poverty relief is concerned , a greater effect will be seen in the rest of the community , which will make the western cape an even more attractive tourism destination and create an even better atmosphere for trade and investment and will eventually enhance the quality of life of everyone living in this province .
mr speaker , the approach of the hon member mr r williams reminds me a little of the patron who really likes to see a beautiful omelette on a silver platter come into the dining-room , but is quite unprepared to deal with the breaking of the eggs and the messy process of actually making the omelette in the kitchen .
the committee , therefore , recommends that urgent steps be taken to ensure that heads of department and / or representatives are fully prepared for meetings during which all matters in reports relevant to them are to be discussed and that steps be taken to strongly communicate to all institutions and departments of the administration the importance of appearing before the committee .
mr speaker , i am sure the house would agree with me that it is rather ironical when someone like the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation stands up and talks about judgments in zimbabwe which have been interfered with , whereas the party that he represents deliberately manipulated the high court , by loading it with np yes-men , in order to remove coloured people from the voters ' roll in this country .
therefore believes that if there had not been such a prompt response and close working together of government and public bodies the disaster would have had a massive effect on the tourist and other industries of the province , and therefore thanks all volunteers , sanccob , other ngos and government departments for the thousands of hours of hard work they contributed to the clean-up , and congratulates them on the success of the clean-up operation .
the committee wishes to express its concern that out of a total of 23 monitoring visits , five cases of mismanagement and / or possible fraud had been identified , and therefore recommends that the necessary staff be provided to immediately institute a system of monitoring the records of all institutions which receive financial assistance from the administration and that the provisions of national treasury regulation 8.5 be strictly adhered to .
madam speaker , if i had to analyse the basic difference between the hon premier 's opening address and the speech of the hon leader of the opposition , and had to deal with them in the form of a balance sheet , i believe that we would be talking about the positive , as far as the hon premier 's address is concerned , compared with the total negativity of the hon leader of the opposition .
i would call it responsible and reasonable top-slicing , because the speaker had to accept that in anyone 's terms an increase of 57 % is quite good , and in a province where there are other big needs to be met from a decreasing global amount available to cabinet , parliament 's budget could not be correctly adjusted in one giant leap .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon minister then , given that he has said that the land falls within a sensitive dune area and that the nature in that area should be preserved , does he not think that the houses that are situated thereon and are not used for nature conservation reasons but for residential reasons should not be removed at this point .
these principles are protecting the rights of individuals and respecting language and religion ; giving equal opportunities to all ; accountability , cost-effectiveness and efficiency ; the devolution of responsibility within the education system ; partnerships between the state , parents and the private sector ; safe , stable and productive learning environments ; relevant knowledge and skills-linking with economic needs ; and responding to societal problems such as tuberculosis and aids .
he himself might not have direct financial interests , but there are spin-offs in the very conceptualisation of the hotel project , and also the canal project , which he has now suddenly technically delinked from the convention centre , but which apparently starts at the point of the convention centre and ends at the victoria & albert hotel - and that is not going to benefit the family and its family trust ?
yes , perhaps it is true that " aliens " were involved , because in the late seventies and early eighties , when we became aware of this terribly complex disease for the first time and realised the gravity of the matter , according to reports it was brought into the country by air stewards - and i do not know whether it was ours or those from other countries .
vote 1 - premier [ pr 85 / 2000 ] vote 4 - housing and planning [ pr 102 / 2000 ] vote 7 - health [ pr 105 / 2000 ] vote 8 - trade , industry and tourism [ pr 16 / 2000 ] vote 10 - social services [ pr 81 / 2000 ] vote 13 - local government [ pr 88 / 2000 ]
mr speaker , i too , would like to add my thanks to that of the others who spoke about the cooperation we have had over the past week in the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling and for the cooperation from the administration and all the relevant departments and for the way in which they made their submissions and the way in which we were able to conduct discussions with them .
mr speaker , regarding the old refrain of blaming apartheid when they cannot come up with anything else , i want to say to hon members that unless we pull on the same side of the rope in this province , and in this country for that matter , and stop attacking one another about apartheid and the past , we will not get this show going .
i would like to recommend that the following ideas be promoted , pursued and implemented towards the promotion of the disabled person 's quality of life : a disabled representative at provincial level ; a disability director and a disability desk ; user-friendly built streets ; education , housing and transport for people with disabilities ; accessible skills and entrepreneurial training facilities ; and provision for adequate and affordable health services for the disabled .
[ ms k a mqulwana : madam chairperson , before i deliver my speech , i would like to request that when the hon premier or the hon minister in the office of the premier answer questions again in the house , they should please explain what i perceive to be conflicting statements , because in the standing committee it was made clear that there was no strategic document on the youth .
it is sad , however , to see that having adopted the douglas report , we do not have the means to implement it , because officials who do not have much to do with this parliament , but do have a great deal to do with the administration , get involved and say to the speaker , indirectly or directly , " you cannot do that .
the r60,2 million of over-recovered revenue realised during the 1999-2000 financial year has been allocated during the 2000-01 financial year to votes as follows : r125 000 to education , for the purchase of computer equipment ; r447 000 to environmental and cultural affairs and sport , to meet legal costs and to fund the purchase of library books ; and r59,6 million to economic affairs , agriculture and tourism , the predominant elements of this being -
as a response to the growing concern about the aids epidemic , the welfare sector nationally developed a social welfare plan on aids which has five strategic focuses , namely : the development of an appropriate policy ; a decline in the prevalence of hiv / aids though targeted preventative interventions ; management of the impact of aids on social security ; the development of affordable community-based care and support models ; and the formalisation of strategic alliances .
madam chairperson , perhaps this sounds frivolous but i am making the point that what scares me most about the non-delivery of that hon minister is that they have handed over to her a r10 million budget for poverty relief - that , to an hon minister who deals with the most vulnerable and marginalised sections of our society , those who are the key victims needing poverty alleviation !
i ask that we approach the process with the attitude that we will protect even those municipal employees who do not walk around with their political affiliations on their sleeves , and that we will try to ensure that the people who remain with the municipalities are those who largely possess the expertise to continue rendering the same service , if not a more effective service , in the smaller structures .
i appreciate the work done by all the parties that have been trying to bring stability , and a solution to the crisis , especially the anc , who have spent sleepless nights bringing ideas that could be a solution to this problem , though they have known they do not have the power to implement any decision .
what is more , i believe that one day in the future of the house we shall reach the point at which all of us in the house will be able to say that we are here as public representatives to serve all the people of the province , wherever they live , whatever language they speak or whatever their appearance , and that we shall not raise unnecessary issues relating to that aspect .
3. the hon minister of transport and works and the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation immediately to call on the national ministers of defence and transport and the national commissioner , mr selebi , to assist with manpower , because we know that it is one thing to have good legislation , but it is another thing to be able to implement legislation .
the speaker announced that a vacancy had occurred in the representation in the house due to the resignation of mr m g e wiley on 31 august 2000 , and that the vacancy had been filled by the nomination by the new np of mr m hoza , with effect from 1 september 2000 , and that the member had taken the oath in the speaker 's office on 7 september 2000 .
the standing committee on economic development , having considered the subject of the tourism amendment bill [ b 50b-99 ] ( ncop ) , referred to the legislature in terms of the rules of the national council of provinces ( ncop ) , begs to report that it confers on the western cape 's delegation in the ncop the authority to support the bill with the following recommendation :
the committee , having heard evidence on the reply to resolution 10 , dated 22 october 1999 , wishes to express its dissatisfaction that there is still no consensus between the provincial department of local government and the western cape division of the bargaining council , as well as the parties thereto , on the procedure and / or authority needed when a municipality grants additional remuneration and / or fringe benefits to its employees .
the committee also wishes to recommend that accounting officers exercise the proper care and control of all matters falling within their responsibility as the committee intends to take a strong stance in future towards the application of the provisions of the pfma , especially regarding the recovery of irregular and unauthorised expenditure by responsible officials as well as the implementation of disciplinary steps in cases of financial mismanagement .

the standing committee on economic development , having considered the subject of the meat safety bill [ b 29b-2000 ] , referred to the legislature in terms of the rules of the national council of provinces ( ncop ) , begs to report that it confers on the western cape 's delegation in the ncop the authority to support the bill .
that the house , noting that the minister of housing has not yet established the rental tribunal , as provided for in the rental housing act , calls on the standing committee on governmental affairs and community safety , to convene a meeting to discuss the matter , and further calls on the minister to explain why this has not happened .
i find it interesting that this was discussed not only in the western cape anc caucus , but also in their national caucus , where it was decided that they would now , for a change , have to isolate totally the national leader of the da , mr tony leon , and that overtures would have to be made to premier morkel and mr marthinus van schalkwyk in an attempt to cause a rift in the da .
madam speaker , you have already called me to order and , as a disciplined member of the house , i shall not repeat that the hon member is a liar , but if one examines what appears in hansard and which they have thus far continued to harp on , i cannot understand that as yet they have been unable to come up with anything else .
on 12 january 2000 the residents of the houses on grotto bay instituted an ex parte application in terms of rule 56 , a mandament of spolie against the west coast district council , in which they claim that entry to their houses - the possessory demand in terms of a spoliatus action - was one-sided and outrageously prevented and the specific court was requested to issue an injunction that would immediately reinstate their possessory right .
if they come to me , and i am sure to the hon minister of education , too , and say that they need a little disbursement money for the pta of a specific area to water the fields , and they do not want a king 's ransom , but are prepared to do it just for a small disbursement , we shall definitely look at funding such a project proposal .
what i am saying is that unless we can convince the anc government to act harshly against crime , unless we can convince them to spend less on armed forces and more on the police , and unless we can convince them not to centralise the police function but devolve it to the provinces , all the debates we have in this house will be of little consequence .
it is therefore quite clear that the accusation can only be that the speaker decided not to convene the house immediately but there can be no accusation that the speaker did not regard this as an important matter and did everything in his power to bring the matter up for debate on the first occasion on which the house sat .
madam chairperson , since this was a cabinet decision , could the hon minister of transport and works explain how he is able to provide this sense of detail , which should have been dealt with in scof but which is now being dealt with here , and other cabinet members are not able to provide this kind of information on the programmes for which the money was spent from , and the answers are even termed in phrases like " speculation " , ...
the anc , responding to the invitation by the hon premier to be constructive , would once again say that the government of this province has a unique opportunity to persuade those who voted for it from amongst the powerful , that the future lies in finding that balance by drawing the powerful into a strong partnership to make all our citizens more equal .
since the crisis in the transport sector began , as many hon members have pointed out , we have seen the deaths of mr ganuganu , mr mtshondo and mr swarts , and of a 15-year-old girl referred to by the hon member ms phenduka as zandile smith , who died in the khayelitsha day hospital , apparently because taxi drivers threatened doctors , saying that they should not come to the hospital .
the committee is also of the opinion that the absence of such an agreement might lead to possible loss of the administration 's funds and , therefore , recommends that every effort be made to expeditiously finalise a service level agreement with sita and that the committee 's concerns be brought to the attention of the national department of public service and administration by the director-general of the provincial administration western cape .
the committee , having heard and considered evidence with regard to the reappointment of a part-time district surgeon , notwithstanding the fact that the person was under investigation in a case of alleged fraud , wishes to express its concern about this situation and recommends that , as a matter of urgency , alternative measures be considered in this regard without negatively affecting standards of medical service in the area .
the committee , therefore wishes to recommend that , with a view to enhancing financial competency in the province , the director-general , especially in the light of the pfma , enter into discussions with the national department of finance towards reviewing the conditions of service of financial staff and affecting an improvement in this regard and where a material breakdown in financial management occurs , it should attract immediate and thorough intervention .
( 1 ) calls on the premier to use his powers under the western cape provincial commissions act , 1998 , to institute a commission of inquiry , with the power to summon witnesses and to call for other evidence , to further investigate the serious allegations of corruption and irregularities in both the land use development and building survey directorates of the south peninsula municipality as recommended by the van niekerk inquiry ;
we can say as much as we want to , and he can write affidavits as much as he wants to , but the perception in this province is that for many years there has been an old boys ' club , even while he was in the city council , who have rapidly progressed in their own economic empowerment , and left the majority of black people out of their empowerment circle , and they are continuing to do business as usual .
more perniciously , this philosophy assuages the feelings of whites , saying that their sometimes ill-gotten gains under apartheid are , in fact , a standard that they should hold up for the rest of society to attain , and that they need only to maintain those standards of living , those standards of wealth , education , health care and so on , and that they need to make no sacrifices in their lifestyles .
we believe that we have finally come up with a way that will fulfil the criteria of the financial and fiscal commission , and it works as follows . all transactions that are routed through the financial institutions of the province of the western cape - that includes banks , building societies and all money collection and disbursement agencies - will be subject to a levy , thereby creating an enormous , a gigantic tax net .
mr speaker , the only reason i decided to be the last anc speaker and to speak for only a few minutes is that the hon premier and i , together with the hon minister in the office of the premier - and i now realise that she had gone cold on that particular day - had the occasion to watch some cricket together the other night .
mr speaker , i would also like to add that what we find quite unusual is that anc members in the constituency represented by the hon member mr fransman , are expressing their delight to the dp workers that the anc government in the western cape - because they still believe there is an anc government in the western cape - is providing free id photographs and free money to the registration campaign .
in fact , we need to be asking whether this has more to do with the fact that there is no agreement on these policies in that alliance , or does it have to do with the fact that there can be no agreement because the dp , with 11 % of the vote , has 60 % of the budget in key portfolios where procurement is vitally and strategically important .
we begin with the end in mind , as the hon member mr louis has said , formulate the development and all the outcomes we want children to attain at every level of the school system , and then the curriculum experts get down to preparing it so that teachers know what to do in the classroom and the end-user finds it easy to implement .
what i would like to see is hospital managers - perhaps this is a fantasy in terms of how the public service manages itself - being able to do their own hiring and firing , and to do so in a climate of relative freedom in order to allow them , as managers of these very important institutions , to establish the most efficient services .
the reason for the urgency in finalising this bill is that in order for the province to be financially operational within the prescribed legal framework from 1 april 2000 and to maintain its sound financial management , this direct charges bill needs to commence on the same date as the public finance management act and the western cape appropriation act on 1 april this year , being just more than a week away .
mr speaker , a stalemate in negotiations about the continued peaceful existence of both the bus commuter service on the one hand and the taxi industry on the other hand in khayelitsha is a very serious and potentially dangerous matter , and the issues are in my opinion as follows : firstly , free enterprise versus competition in this market ; secondly , the democratic right to freedom of choice of a community , and we as ...
why then did those provinces manage , as far back as 1998 , to introduce the necessary legislation and resolve the problems , while the western cape government in 1998 appeared to be more concerned about drafting a provincial constitution and kicking the anc out the provincial government , thus removing a minister who was effectively dealing with this process ?
if he had known at that cabinet meeting that planning , local government and housing were not planning to fill posts to the value of r458 000 , would he not have made a different decision about using that money for a three-day registration drive , or would he have asked that that money be seconded to his department for employment of the officials who need to do the work ?
according to section 152 ( 1 ) ( a ) to ( e ) of the constitution of the republic of south africa act , 1996 ( act 108 of 1996 ) , the objects of local government are to " provide democratic and accountable government " , " ensure the provision of services to communities " , " promote social and economic development " , " promote a safe and healthy environment " and " encourage the involvement of communities " .
the standing committee on education , environmental and cultural affairs , having considered the subject of the education laws amendment bill [ b48b-2000 ] ( ncop ) , referred to the legislature in terms of the rules of the national council of provinces ( ncop ) , begs to report that it confers on the western cape 's delegation in the ncop a mandate to support the bill .
that , as a result of the recent fatal shooting that took place in bonteheuwel , resulting in the closure of schools for the past two days , the house calls on the minister of community safety to urgently send reinforcements to stabilise the situation , and further calls on the minister of education to take the necessary steps to normalise the situation at the schools .
as president thabo mbeki pointed out in his state of the nation address on 4 february , at no other point in time have we ever been as well placed as we are today to take decisive forward steps to achieve the progress necessary to meet the challenge of ensuring that all of us act together to achieve high and sustained rates of growth for our economy .
while we are moving out of the recession which has bedevilled this and other developing countries in recent years , and while interest rates have fallen and gdp growth is predicted to average around 3,4 % over the next three years , south africa 's growth prospects nevertheless remain inadequate to the challenges of a host of unmet socio-economic needs that confront us , particularly in the fields of unemployment , poverty , education , health and welfare .
] if that is not the case , that hon member should ask the hon member mr mckenzie , who is subject to an investigation by my department at the moment , about meetings that he has held with cpos where he has said , " you have to support the anc in the local government elections ; we will see to it that you become professional officers " , and a whole host of other related political matters .
madam chairperson , i know from international examples how these suggestions can practically uplift the poor , but the anc government at central level continues to prevent a pluralism of views in the provinces ; it prevents regional diversity - which is so important where each of our provinces has its own wonderful strengths and opportunities - and the anc at central level simply prevents experimentation at a local or provincial level .
] it was only a few weeks ago , and i thank him for the compliment which i believe he extended to me , but it is a sad thing about politics that only a few weeks ago , from those benches over there , the hon member who is journeying in another country was screaming that i was incompetent , i was incompetent , i was incompetent , and calling for my resignation .
madam chairperson , i dream dreams and i see visions of this day in the next period of four years at the end of this parliament , when we discuss votes in this parliament , and the hon member mr mckenzie has got it into his colleagues ' heads that if ever there is an opportunity for them to make an appeal for their constituencies , for their service areas , then it is the debates on budget votes .
mr speaker , i present today an amendment to the road transportation act , 1977 ( act 74 of 1977 ) that has the potential to contribute to overcoming the crisis experienced since the first two weeks of april this year in our province , in which the golden arrow bus service and other transport operators have been intimidated and prevented from entering khayelitsha and other nearby suburbs .
mr speaker , i move without notice : that the house expresses its concern about the disturbing delays in pension and grant payouts experienced over the last month in the western cape , and further expresses its sympathy with the elderly and indigent who were severely inconvenienced during the payout process , and calls on all role-players to ensure that our citizens never have to face such humiliating delays again .
that the house , in the light of information given by the minister of economic affairs and tourism in the house on 20 june 2000 , investigates the non-fulfilment of responsibilities of the chairperson of the standing committee on economic affairs with regard to the standing committee 's preparation and submission to the ncop summit on small , medium and micro enterprises held on 8 may 2000 .
if we look at the bill itself , as hon members will know , the sections deal variously with the definitions ; shareholder authorisation ; the objects of convenco - with the protection that if it strayed from these objects , we would not be authorised to contribute to it any longer ; representation on the board ; financial regulatory provisions ; control and reporting ; and then retrospective operation until 8 june last year when the original shareholders ' agreement was signed .
the committee , having heard and considered evidence which indicated that timeous and adequate replies to the auditor-general 's informal queries and management letters were not supplied , thereby hampering the execution of the audit as well as the finalisation of the audit report , wishes to recommend that heads of departments take steps to ensure that this department and all other departments pay prompt and thorough attention in this regard .
the standing committee on economic development , having considered the subject of the construction industry development board bill [ b 59-2000 ] ( ncop ) , referred to the legislature in terms of the rules of the national council of provinces ( ncop ) , begs to report that it confers on the western cape 's delegation in the ncop the authority to support the bill with the following recommendations :
[ interjections . ] and it took none other than the auditor-general , mr shauket fakie , to reveal that not the eastern cape - not such a bantustan like the eastern cape - but in fact the national department of welfare based in pretoria failed to spend not 10 % , not 50 % , not 80 % but 99 % of their r204 million poverty relief budget in the 1998-1999 financial year .
the fourth , fifth and sixth floors will be upgraded ; an office for public participation will be set up at the 7 wale street entrance ; the interpreting and sound system in the chamber will be improved ; interpreting booths will be installed in the two committee rooms ; a separate telephone exchange will be brought into use ; and unutilised space , such as the old coffee room , the committee room on the sixth floor and the penthouse flat , will be converted into open-plan office space .
but , with god 's guidance i truly believe that this government and all the people of the province are well on their way to realising our vision - a vision recently echoed by none other than our uk visitor , mr peter hain - of making this the most desirable province to work in , live in , learn in , visit and do business with .
in a business environment , if any individual in that business goes to the directorate and says , " directors , i want to know if you will give me permission to go and do research , and ask the university to do research , to see whether there are any additional ways to raise revenue in this business , " it would be impossible for the directorate to say no .
there is no way in which the school will ever reach its full potential , especially if one compares it to a certain former model c school that has a budget of r3,5 million , where business donates generously to the employees ' children , 23 governing body posts are filled , the teachers are paid incentives of up to r250 000 per year and even the principal receives an allowance for initiating progress at the school .
that the house notes that the recent eastern cape congress of the new np has paved the way for cooperation between the anc and the new np in the eastern cape and that the new np regards dialogue with the dp as a waste of time and that this development only serves to place the coalition in the western cape under further suspicion and to emphasise it as extremely unholy .
i request that this request really be taken seriously and that we as a province , particularly in this phase of transition to new municipalities and in the absence of guiding legislation relating to the functions and responsibilities of the various categories of municipalities , play a monitoring and supportive role to ensure that municipal services do not collapse , but that the communities continue to receive the services to which they are entitled .
i shudder to think about that situation : the worst thing that could have happened would have been that those who got onto the buses , for whatever reason they did so , became the targets of instability and this detracted from the main crisis , which is the effect on black lives , and focused the attention on the prima donnas who believed that they wanted to make a point .
mr speaker , i move : that all elected and nominated members of the house meet , under the chairpersonship of the chairperson of committees , to deliberate on the draft western cape fiscal policy ( wcfp ) for the 2001-02 - 2003-04 medium-term expenditure framework ( mtef ) , and that following the deliberations the following members shall constitute an ad hoc committee to formally consider and report to the house on the policy :
the standing committee on education , environmental and cultural affairs , having considered the subject of the adult basic education and training bill [ b42b-2000 ] ( ncop ) , referred to the legislature in terms of the rules of the national council of provinces ( ncop ) , begs to report that it confers on the western cape 's delegation in the ncop a mandate to support the bill .
the committee also wishes to recommend that accounting officers exercise the proper care and control of all matters falling within their responsibility as it intends to take a strong stance in future towards the application of the provisions of the public finance management act , 1999 , especially in regards to the recovery of irregular and unauthorised expenditure by responsible officials as well as the implementation of disciplinary steps in cases of financial misconduct .
] he did not have to explain which programme the funds in his department came from ; he did not have to explain how many members of his department were deployed and where they were deployed , and what the consequences for his department were ; and he did not have to apply his mind in yesterday 's debate as to whether or not he supported the vote and agreed to the decision .
and we keep in mind that there is not even a possibility of expanding the space available to us here in the foreseeable future , then we must be able to tell the city fathers of cape town that the physical location of parliament may appear to be very favourable , as the speaker said - central , easily reached - but these are the very factors that create problems for us .
regarding the inferno that gutted the or tambo informal settlement in wellington , whether he has received the list of names and details of the victims who were applying for emergency relief aid ; if not , why not ; if so , ( a ) whether aid was made available , ( b ) how soon was it granted and ( c ) in what form was it granted ?
i would like to say to the hon minister that if this process and the new regulations from 1 april 2000 are being devolved to local government and local review boards , there is no doubt that the people involved will need to be trained - trained regarding not only the regulations and the different legislation at the national , provincial and local government levels , but also legislation on town planning , environmental matters , disposable waste , and so on .
the minister who then dealt with the matter - and i think correctly - decided to go to tender to find a consultant who would advise on how this particular r10 million should be spent in order to comply with the specific condition laid down by the cabinet that the money had to be spent according to a business plan approved by the cabinet .
the committee , having heard and considered evidence with regard to the overall financial management in the administration and having taken cognisance of the year-on-year decrease in the number of qualified audit reports , nevertheless wishes to express its concern that all the qualifications appear to be directly as a result of deficient internal checking and control measures and recommends that concerted efforts be made to place this matter on a sound footing .
mr speaker , the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling reports the western cape ninth cape gamblng and racing amendment bill [ b12-2000 ] , dated 5 september 2000 , as follows : the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling , having considered the subject of the western cape ninth gambling and racing amendment bill [ b12-2000 ] , referred to it , begs to report the bill without amendment .
after the new np in the council had tried to stop the matter from being discussed any further , and had ensured that no further action would be taken by the council , and after i and other anc members and , i may say , dp members , had had numerous discussions with civics , ratepayers ' associations and citizens of the south peninsula , i proposed the motion we are discussing in the house today in may 2000 .
transformation as it relates to the broader provincial administration , which is currently the responsibility of the directorate : corporate services as the leading department ; transformation as a support function to the three desks in so far as it relates to gender equality , the rights of the disabled and also youth development ; and the monitoring and evaluation of progress made within government departments with regard to all transformation initiatives , which is currently the responsibility of my office .
mr speaker , many of these projects and proposals are authorised by the hon minister and i would like to ask him this : in terms of his overall view - we had a thick document that we had to go through at the time of the budget debate - does he think the way moneys are being transferred actually does take into account the demographics of this province and the gender biases that he says he has built into their criteria ?
they have failed miserably , and yet hon members on the other side of the house - as well as their fellow travellers , sympathisers , " poofters " and appeasers - dare to attack me in my personal capacity because i had the courage of my convictions to get up and say openly , " yes , there is no business plan for the poverty relief desk that was established last year on 15 november 1999 .
that this house notes the march on 15 march 2000 by 500 people in citrusdal under the banner of the anc to protest against liquor stores opening their doors to children and the local police station where it is believed that racism prevails , and supports the struggle of the people of citrusdal to protect their children , eliminate racism and transform the police .
] i am sure we all appreciate the period that we are going into ; a period where there is no election in sight for at least three years and we all have the opportunity to focus less on our parties and more on our people , to speak less in sound bites and more with clarity and meaning , and to cast our visions in the longer term , as opposed to the immediate .
mr speaker , arising from the hon minister of housing 's reply , would he not have concerns as the minister responsible for housing that , despite his admission today that his department has not identified even provincially-owned land for housing , asset management is proceeding to sell certain provincial assets which many people in the community believe would be more appropriately used for housing ?
whether he or his department intends setting up a provincial microbiological monitoring programme for all the holiday resorts in the province with the aim of ensuring that the water at all the holiday resorts is fit for consumption and that faecal pollution causing gastro-enteritis , dysentery , cholera , typhoid fever and hepatitis is properly kept in check ; if not , why not ; if so , ( a ) when and ( b ) how will this programme be managed ?
the committee also wishes to recommend that accounting officers exercise the proper care and control of all matters falling within their responsibility as it intends to take a strong stance in future towards the application of the provisions of the public finance management act , 1999 , with regard to the recovery of irregular and unauthorised expenditure by responsible officials and the implementation of disciplinary steps in cases of financial misconduct .
despite the destructive criticism i have heard in recent times , as well as the malice , i do hope that the budget i am going to submit to the house will do justice to the important groupings for which i am responsible , namely women under the gender equality desk , the disabled under the rights of the disabled desk and the youth , as well as the poor in the community who were also entrusted to me recently .
as far as my budget is concerned , i wish to address an invitation to any hon member present in the house today , and indeed i want to issue a challenge to him or her to rise if he or she is of the opinion that the rights of the disabled , the empowerment and development of women , and youth development , were not accorded cinderella treatment over many years in this province and in the rest of the country .
i believe that the problem should be tackled at its core , and that is why i intend asking the rules committee to define the parliamentary precincts more clearly in the western cape law on the powers and privileges of the provincial legislature , 1995 ( act 3 of 1995 ) in order to bring the control and management of the appropriate parts of this building under the control of the speaker and later that of the envisaged parliamentary management team .
madam chairperson , in the situation in which the final approval of a bill takes place in the second reading debate - a bill just goes to a committee and comes back for the second reading and is then finally approved - there is yet another guarantee for the parties that are not in government that they can put amendments on the order paper , so that that bill is not steamrollered through parliament .
whether he or his department intends setting up a provincial microbiological monitoring programme for all the holiday resorts in the province with the aim of ensuring that the water at all the holiday resorts is fit for consumption and that fecal pollution causing gastro-enteritis , dysentery , cholera , typhoid fever and hepatitis is properly kept in check ; if not , why not ; if so , ( a ) when and ( b ) how will this programme be managed ?
this side of the house insists that the hon minister and the hon premier must make a statement to the public of the province why three years after the adoption of the constitution of the western cape one of the centrally important issues has not seen the light of day and has not been debated in a province where the protection of the environment is a matter of life and death for generations to come .
the total of 50,6 % of the provincial budget which used to go to local authorities has come down to 12,9 % , thereby reducing provincial powers in respect of local government to establish , maintain and expand local authority structures ; promote civil protection and maintain fire-fighting services ; ensure the administration and execution of property valuations , advisory services ; and provide assistance with elections .
since about 50 % of the taxi operators were kicked out by the administration process , the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation made a public statement at the new np conference to the effect that no further legalisation would be provided , but that all that remains is to crush - i repeat , is to crush - all the illegal operators and set up a monument on the n2 .
i wish to tell the hon minister that the dp and i support this bill and trust that this amendment to the legislation will be the solution , giving him as minister responsible for transport in this province the power to control the taxi presence in problem areas and restore the rights and dignity , which we all fought for , of the people of khayelitsha - their right to safe , reliable and affordable transport .
however , we want the hon minister of transport and works to tell this house how , over the next 30 days , we will set up a forum to negotiate this issue , to resolve the issue of permits and to deal with the matter so that at the end of the day commuters do not suffer and the transformation of the transport industry is addressed and the fundamental questions are resolved so that we can build stability throughout our province .
mr speaker , the commitment by government will further be noticed when people are not turned away without receiving medical treatment ; do not have to stand in long queues at the hospitals ; the shortage of staff in the khayelitsha day hospital and the guguletu clinic is addressed ; and when the economic growth that the hon premier talks about benefits every citizen and is not simply something that is written on paper .
that the house notes with concern that during the term of office of the present minister of community safety , sport and recreation the saps have failed to overcome gangsterism , and that all his efforts in this regard have been ineffective , and further calls on the premier to do or say something to show that this new np / dp government are serious about combating crime .
mr speaker , further to this the cost of loans for people starting micro enterprises should be brought down by amending the usury act ; one-stop licensing shops should be set up where entrepreneurs would be able to complete all the formalities regarding the establishment of a business ; tax exemptions for an initial period of a new small business venture should be implemented ; and small business with a turnover of less than r2,5 million annually should be entitled to account for vat on a payments basis .
the standing committee on health , social services , office of the premier and corporate services , having considered the subject of the national health laboratory service bill [ b52-2000 ] ( ncop ) , referred to the legislature in terms of the rules of the national council of provinces ( ncop ) , begs to report that it confers on the western cape 's delegation in the ncop a final mandate to support the bill with the following recommendations :
last year , for the first time , i introduced in this province a process of consultation by advertising , calling people in , communicating with them on a regular basis , having presentations before the budget and after the budget as well , and discussing it with as many people as possible in business , ngos and so on in order to form an opinion of what the feeling is with regard to the budgetary process .
even though i am not a member of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling , i would like to support the committee in their recommendation of a multiparty monitorial committee to see what happened once the hon premier had entered into this type of relationship.the committee would filter through the details of new relationships and see to it that they were put into practice through wesgro , the department of economic affairs , tourism and agriculture or another institution .
mr speaker , what we are dealing with in this issue is the misuse of public office by a political party , and i am very interested to hear the hon minister of environmental and cultural affairs - and this must be the first time a minister has stated this in a provincial parliament - can attend one meeting both as the deputy leader of his party and as a minister at the same time .
given his present understanding that the fact is that the rest of the country did this on a voluntary basis , and if he had had the opportunity to save the r9 000 in this financial year - i repeat , in this financial year - and he could have campaigned and mobilised people to do this on a voluntary basis , would the hon minister indicate whether he would have authorised the expenditure of this money ?
if i were a judge and came from a background in which i had grown up in an iron shack where i often did not have food to eat , and i heard a case about a child involved in a theft , and that child explained to me that he had to steal because he had no food in his home that evening , i believe that i would hear that case with a particular empathy .
madam speaker , the udm wishes to condemn all forms of violence , crime and criminality , wherever they are committed , whether they are committed in a home , in a street , in an alleyway or on a farm , and through the use of whatever object , be it physical , with a blunt unknown object , using firearms or a bomb and whoever it is aimed at , and we wish to reject it with the contempt it deserves .
for example , we need to ignore the protestations of popcru and recruit highly qualified managers into the saps ; we need to improve the lot and life of ordinary policemen and women , and introduce performance-related conditions of service ; we need to get police officers out from behind station desks and away from guarding government buildings , such as this one , and onto the streets where they belong by outsourcing all non-core political functions to the private sector , as the hon member mr winde mentioned in his speech .
moreover , i would be failing in my duty if i did not mention that the members , across political lines , have assisted more than ever this time in drawing up the report , not thinking of the next election but of the next generation , not looking to the success of their individual parties but the success of the province , and not drifting but steering the future budget into calmer waters .
as a solution to the problem we should perhaps look at the following : firstly , the employment of about 20 % local teachers , who should be in the near vicinity of the schools and could deter vandals ; secondly , the teachers should be encouraged to move back to the towns where they are employed ; and thirdly , the creation of after-school centres where children can play , do their homework , visit the library or sleep .
i would like to take this opportunity to address a matter which is of major concern to all of us who believe , and i am firmly of that conviction , that sport and recreation , in other words , non-competitive sport , at school level is a critical factor in not only a holistic development of a child but also in the maintenance of our international standing in respect of sport and in achieving representivity at all levels of sport .
the criteria for financing will no longer be based on a sense of entitlement or the notion that " i exist , therefore you must finance me " , but rather on - i want to mention some of the criteria - effectiveness , relevance of expected outcomes , social integration , diversity and equity , services that cover more than one service level , the integration of special development areas on all service levels , and , very importantly , a service link between social services and social assistance .
this framework is intended , firstly , to ensure that infected and affected children have access to integrated services that address their basic needs ; secondly , to provide the impetus for the development and implementation of approaches that effectively capacitate and mobilise children , families and communities to combat many of the effects of the disease ; and , thirdly , to develop a long-term strategy that will prepare south africa adequately for further challenges .
madam chairperson , in answer to the first remark which was not a question in regard to the pfma , perhaps we would be better advised in this province in so far as the pfma is concerned if the national minister of finance had carried out an undertaking to send out teams to all the provinces in order to train not only the officials but also hon members of the house in so far as the pfma is concerned .
the committee , having heard and considered evidence with regard to possible overpayments totalling r816 470 and r33 788 in respect of catering service contracts , wishes to recommend that it be supplied with : a detailed list of overpayments in this regard ; a progress report on the steps taken to finalise the matter ; a report on the steps taken towards recovery of the overpayments , and details of disciplinary action taken against any officials in this regard .
two additional back-up centrifugal pumps have been given to the area ; electricity upgrading has been done ; two generators have been installed at a cost of r1,8 million ; the wall of the macassar retention dam , which was breached , has now been repaired , and the sewage is now being pumped to another dam ; the sewage spillage has been done away with in that particular area ; and odour-control equipment has been installed at the macassar pump station .
matters currently enjoying attention are the street child programme ; places of safety for the youth ; socio-economic consequences of hiv / aids and tb in the western cape province ; the recent fires in the western cape and the feedback from the task group appointed by the cabinet ; the plundering of marine resources and the impact of operation neptune in the overberg - the operation which the central government has unfortunately abolished ; and the urban reconstruction strategy as well as the focus on the manenberg and mitchells plain areas .
i want to state quite clearly here that the facts do not support that contention , because at the time the first request for volunteers was made , on 16 november 1998 , to deal with the round of voter registration that was coming at the beginning of december , both these ruling parties were engaged in constitutional court cases against the iec and both these parties were sending messages out to their voters , saying : " do not worry , do not register .
i want to say to the hon premier that since he pointed out in his opening address that he was the premier of all the people in the western cape province , we hope that in the history of the house we shall never put the hon premier or any premier who follows him , in a position where he finds it necessary to point out that he is the premier of all the people in the province .
sir , i challenge the dp to tell the house and the coloured people when they have ever been of benefit to us , because when the coloured people needed them and asked them to stand by them , it was prof richard van der ross who said in the cape town city hall that the most honourable thing the white liberals could do was to resign their seats in the city council , and they never did .
whether he is aware of the inhuman brutality which occurs daily against farm workers on farms in the province , with specific reference to the farm de rust near vredendal , where mr victor mcotshana died on 31 july 2000 , because of his atrocious living conditions on the farm , as well as other similar cases ; if so , ( a ) whether he will make a statement on such brutality and ( b ) what steps will be taken to address the problem ?
that the house expresses its dismay with the employment of illegal immigrants by certain white commercial farmers in the boland region , as reported in the cape times of 30 march 2000 and confirmed by the police in the same issue , whereby they make themselves guilty of practices which resemble slavery , while poverty and unemployment are the order of the day amongst south african citizens in this region , and further requests the minister of agriculture to immediately investigate this racist and illegal work practices .
calls on organised agriculture to investigate whether this farmer is one of their members and if so , to expel him from the organisation , by so doing sending a clear message that such human rights violations and racism will not be tolerated , and further expresses its deepest concern that the dp and new np appear more concerned about the situation on farms in zimbabwe than the plight of farm workers in the province .
the standing committee on health , social services , office of the premier and corporate services , having considered the subject of the chiropractors , homeopaths and allied health service professions amendment bill [ b66-2000 ] ( ncop ) , referred to the legislature in terms of the rules of the national council of provinces ( ncop ) , begs to report that it confers on the western cape 's delegation in the ncop a mandate to support the bill .
( 1 ) whether he has complied with the provisions of the western cape land administration act by annually reporting to the provincial parliament on the status of provincial immovable assets , which includes property earmarked for disposal , development and transfer , in line with land redistribution and / or land reform programmes ; if not , why not ; if so , what are the details of the ( a ) categories , ( b ) amounts and ( c ) interested parties ;
in the 1999-2000 financial year 15 sport codes have been assisted with hosting national and international events , including the following : the absa national athletics series ; the sa judo nationals in the boland ; safa , with women 's football and the netherlands ' national team ; an international karate match between south africa and new zealand ; the sa nationals in figure skating ; an interregional basketball tournament ; sa sailing was assisted with the 2000 cape to rio race ; international dragon boat racing ; the western province under-17 interprovinical soccer championships ; youth sailing championships ; and the international series of western province hockey .
it is difficult to single out schools for praise , but i must mention schools such as cedar high and glendale secondary in mitchells plain ; lavender hill secondary and hillside primary in lavender hill ; mount view secondary in hanover park ; john ramsay high in bishop lavis ; beauvallon high in valhalla park ; excelsior secondary in belhar ; and guguletu comprehensive secondary - and we know those schools face many other problems .
in pursuance of resolution 17 of the committee 's report dated 31 may 1999 , the committee , whilst taking cognisance of the envisaged new disciplinary procedure for the department of education and the steps taken to implement the new disciplinary procedure in other provincial departments , recommends that the director-general arrange a symposium for the members of the committee and with all other stakeholders in order that a more comprehensive appreciation of all the role players ' parts in the process can be obtained .
that the house expresses its concern about the high incidence of hiv / aids amongst nurses , who are the very persons entrusted and trained to support those infected with the dreaded virus , and , because hiv / aids kills our people and because we should all stand together to fight this disease together , calls on all political parties to stop trying to score political points with regard to this matter .
calls on organised agriculture to ascertain whether this farmer is one of their members and if so , to expel him from the organisation , by so doing sending a clear message that such human rights violations and racism will not be tolerated , and further expresses its deepest concern that the dp and new np appear more concerned about the situation on farms in zimbabwe than the plight of farm workers in the province .
in view of the similar circumstances at the department of education , and to enable the committee to ensure that the process followed with the appointment of security companies in general comply with the fundamentals of state procurement , viz. fairness , transparency and cost effectiveness , it recommends that the aspects surrounding the procurement of security services at all departments , and in particular the department of education , be subjected to a forensic audit by the administration 's internal audit component as a matter of urgency .
despite the assurance given by the hon minister of education during a previous debate in the house , that the pupils of these institutions will not be included in mainstream education , the hon member mr lewis , after attending a public hearing at wellington , reported to the standing committee that a senior official of the department did tell the parent community of that institution at wellington that the pupils would be incorporated in mainstream education .
however , may i say , and this is what worries me , the next morning , wednesday morning , when we expected a massive full-scale operation to enforce the law , i was informed by the police that they had been told to go softly , softly on the taxi drivers because the national minister of safety and security wanted to come and speak to the taxi industry that afternoon and try to negotiate some sort of settlement - with no consultation with my colleague , whose responsibility that sort of negotiation is !
we only need to look at the newspapers over the last few days , at what has happened at the church in rocklands - about which this government has been deafeningly silent ; what is happening in newlands now around the soccer issue , which the hon minister of transport , sport and recreation has yet to mention in the press , and no one on that side of the house has mentioned in this debate ; and at what is happening in many of the schools , as we discussed yesterday .
i want to tell the hon member ms mqulwana that the following could have been in place since 30 july 1995 because her comrades were party to the hon minister 's document : the selection of the smt , and the hon minister of education would have been responsible for that ; the appointment of a youth commissioner for which the hon minister of education would have been responsible ; the launch of a youth council ; a youth policy document ; draft youth programmes ; and a youth policy document presented to the provincial legislature , followed by a provincial youth summit .
madam chairperson , if our province cannot secure equal opportunities for those who were discriminated against ; if we cannot educate the uneducated for the management cadre ; if we cannot give faith to those who are despairing ; if we cannot win back the trust of generations of our youth who are on the verge of being lost to this nation forever , our newly found political democracy and the peace process will have been in vain and our newly found freedom will be hollow .
i regard his speech as very inappropriate , this coming from a hon member who has not been to any scof meetings that i attended where we discussed the budget , an hon member who has not even attended one meeting of the standing committee on health since i took up my post , an hon member who did not even go to the trouble of reading what i said in my speech apart from listening to it .
to crown everything , the hon members on that side of the house , and anyone would be able to say who they are , are trying to justify their malicious , personal and venomous " nat attack " on me by - and now i must use the afrikaans expression - " knaend te kerm soos ' n kat oor ' n derm " about the absence of a business plan for the desk concerned with poverty relief , instead of focusing on the real issues .
that the house expresses its deepest sympathy with the families and friends of those who lost their lives in the road accident in the vanrhyns pass , and commends the national deputy minister of agriculture and the leader of the opposition in the provincial parliament for joining the vanrhynsdorp community in a wreath-laying ceremony on 4 june 2000 , and further calls on the provincial department of transport and works to take measures to ensure greater safety for those using this pass .
that the house notes that the leadership of the dp did not invite the new np to the talks on a united opposition , and further notes that the leader of the dp in the province has not yet responded to the challenge of the deputy leader of the new np in the province to make public the minutes of a meeting held between the new np and the dp in the province about cooperation during the forthcoming election .
the committee , having heard and considered evidence with regard to the purchase of sound equipment , wishes to express its concern at the departments lack of following tender regulations and the lack of supporting documentation and recommends that consideration should be given to the creation of a central advisory body for the review of all departmental needs in respect of audio visual equipment and a possible centralised procurement policy in respect of this type of equipment and that a cost benefit analysis be undertaken before each purchase .
the committee , having heard and considered evidence which indicated that the excess was due to a grant to the amount of r5,696 million received from the department of state expenditure in respect of the improvement of conditions of service of temporary teachers as from 1 july 1998 which could , due to a delay , not be included in the department 's budget for 1998-99 , recommends that the unauthorised expenditure of r3 850 140,72 be referred to the provincial parliament for authorisation .
7.1 the committee heard and considered evidence which indicated that , notwithstanding the serious concern expressed regarding the delay in addressing this matter as mentioned in resolution 9 of its report tabled in the provincial parliament on 31 may 1999 , little progress towards recovering the overpayment of r3 714 641 had been made or that legal action had not been taken against the company or persons involved in the possible fraud .
the problem with rates and the problem with the opposition to it is because the entire system of local government and the economic imperative that has been applied at local government , is in fact the economic imperative of the anc that still results in this country producing a lower than expected growth rate ; it still succeeds the economic policy of the anc ; and it still succeeds in this country in producing lower economic expectations and fewer jobs .
the anc appeals to the house to appoint an inclusive commission of inquiry into the conditions on farms that give rise to violence to ensure that we do not only address that which will enable us to catch offenders , but ensure that we also address the root of the problem and find ways , when that root has to do with poverty and the social evils in our community , to do something about it .
or is it a case , which is endemic to the thinking and ideology of the dp and new np , that where conflicts of interest occur and measures are put in place to ensure that corruption does not take place in any form , this is only worth noting and raising when it applies to an anc government or when it does not apply to structures and processes where the so-called black lite do not benefit ?
that the house notes with dismay the orchestrated increased attacks on the independence and integrity of the south african judiciary by the anc , and further strongly condemns members of the house who publicly take part therein , viz the chief whip of the anc by casting of aspersions on former judge president e l king in the chamber on 18 april 2000 , and the anc whip mr m l fransman , about the sentence in the boesak case at the prison in malmesbury over the past weekend .
mr speaker , how seriously can the taxi industry take the government when the hon minister of community safety , sport and recreation , in response to the inflammatory statements about closing down the town and to the perpetrators of violence and death and so forth , says , " although i cannot give you all the details , i must tell you we will not be soft on the perpetrators ; we know who they are and we will be making arrests very soon .
in broad outline this agreement provides for the following : the convention centre should be larger and the size , design and so on had to be decided on by convenco ; sunwest had to buy in as a non-voting shareholder of convenco and contribute the r140 million to convenco for the construction of the site ; the three public authorities would commit an amount of r60 million each , thus making a total of r320 million available for the development of the icc ; shareholding arrangements had to be devised ; and the provincial contribution needed to be authorised .
in the light of the above-mentioned resolutions which indicate various cases of non-compliance with prescriptions and procedures , the committee wishes to recommend that accounting officers exercise the proper care and control of all matters falling within their responsibility as the committee intends to take a strong stance towards the application of the provisions of the pfma with regard to the recovery of irregular and unauthorised expenditure by responsible officials and the implementation of disciplinary hearings in cases of financial misconduct .
mr speaker , in the face of the constant theme of the hon premier and the cabinet that this is the best province , and given the fact that his budget from the national government has increased , can he account to the people of the province for the decreased quality of service delivery as seen in the long queues in which our people have to stand at hospitals , the lack of medicine , the poor service at police stations and the long payout queues where our pensioners have to stand in the rain ?
key components of the strategy will be interventions aimed at , amongst others , focusing more sharply on areas identified as having relatively high prevalence of hiv / aids ; delaying the age of first sexual contact ; expanding the syndromic management of sexually transmitted diseases ; reducing the incidence of mother-to-child transmission ; continuing with our programme of voluntary counselling and testing at every one of our health facilities ; destigmatising aids ; and coordinating hiv / aids prevention activities between governmental and nongovernmental organisations .
it is correct to place on record that if blame is to be allocated , and i also take co-responsibility for it - i was not in office , but i do not believe that one should shirk responsibility - after the initial successes in the joint operation at the beginning of last year , there was a lapse on the part of both intelligence and security forces in staying on top of the situation , which has resulted in the situation being out of control at the moment .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon premier which of the following requests for proclamations from the heath commission to the office of the premier have been agreed to : the oostenberg tlc for corruption , fraud and misappropriation of funds ; the calitzdorp tlc for maladministration , fraud , corruption and unlawful expenditure ; the great brak river tlc for maladministration and irregularities ; the robertson tlc for maladministration , fraud , corruption and unlawful expenditure ; the worcester tlc for maladministration and unlawful expenditure ; the west coast district council for maladministration ; the grabouw tlc for maladministration ; and the napier tlc .
having heard from the hon member mr ramatlakane on the other side that it is a national competency , which is what he interjected , i want to draw his attention to the fact that it is my function to hear from experts , as many as there are within this province , in order to be able to go to the budget council and present those views , because i am not an expert with a complete world of knowledge - and that gives the hon member mr dugmore an opening .
that the house notes with dismay the orchestrated attacks on the independence and integrity of the south african judiciary by the anc , and further strongly condemns members of the house who publicly take part therein , viz the chief whip of the anc by casting of aspersions on former judge president e l king on 18 april 2000 in the chamber , and the anc whip mr m l fransman , about the sentence in the boesak case at the prison in malmesbury over the past weekend .
mr speaker , how can it be any different out there if representatives of the people make remarks like , " brown people have dirty mouths " - and i am translating freely ; that one of our strong points is our ability to " breed " ; that my daughter takes offence when a brown child calls her mother and says , " mommy " ; when black mothers in parliament are in any event only there to take food , and that is why they attend congresses ...
( 1 ) in the light of the dramatic increase in the budget of the department of health since 1998 to the proposed figure of r3,3 billion for the 2000-01 financial year , whether he could provide the figures for the same period for ( a ) the tb prevalence , ( b ) waiting times for hip replacements , ( c ) waiting time for patients at community health care clinics , ( d ) all categories of staff lost at the different levels in the department of health and ( e ) the shortage of medicine at health facilities ;
mr speaker , i want to ask the hon minister of local government and development planning whether he is satisfied with the actions of the municipality of darling , given the appointment of the former town clerk , after he had taken a package , to a post which had not existed previously , the size of the municipality and the transformation process which would necessarily involve supernumerary posts and which means that the municipality may have to pay out a further large sum of money to the former town clerk who has now been appointed as town secretary .
at the schools at which our children get to school in difficult circumstances , whether it is because their parental homes are not all that could be desired as a result of socio-economic circumstances and there is no motivational support ; or because crime , violence and gang activities make it virtually impossible for the pupils to follow a normal school career ; or because the pupils are simply not motivated because they see there is no future for them and they often lack the role models to encourage them to achieve their ideals .
that the house calls on the minister of community safety , sport and recreation to urgently investigate allegations that members of the saps in khayelitsha were drunk whilst on duty on friday , 2 june 2000 , resulting in their failure to respond to a call from community leaders to arrest a suspect who had fired shots at a resident , and further expresses its concern at the apparent failure to act against members of the saps who are guilty of such behaviour .
that factual position is that under the new np and the weak , tired leadership of the hon premier , the western cape has failed to eradicate racism in this province ; under the weak , tired leadership of the western cape they are failing to address poverty in the province ; and under the weak , tired leadership of the hon premier the western cape has failed to address the issue of the safety and security of our people .
madam chairperson , the various planned policies referred to by the hon minister are developing policy and initiating legislation to establish measures to protect consumers from unfair business practice , including the establishment of a consumer tribunal in the province ; preparation of a liquor policy , which i will come back to later ; facilitating and formulating policy on effective property management , and programmes for economic development between departments and spheres of government ; and facilitating and administering the development of policy strategy and regulatory framework for tourism in the western cape .
mr speaker , in a letter that the current president , who was then the vice-president , wrote to judge kriegler on 25 january 1999 , a month after this issue came up , he made it quite clear that the government was assisting the iec to find volunteers inside and outside the public service to carry out the registration work with a view , amongst other things , to the prudent utilisation of public funds consistent with the comments made by the auditor-general when he reviewed the 1994 accounts of the iec .
let me tell the anc , the hon premier has appealed to all the parties in the house , including the acdp and the udm , to look beyond political boundaries and rather to be concerned about the people of this province and to determine what we can do for the people of the province , rather than scoring political points and telling one another what is better and what is worse - that the new np is bad and the anc is better .
given that the hon premier and the provincial government have received a number of golden arrow and silver arrow awards from the pmr for their handling of issues like service delivery , how does he justify their receiving those awards to the people of the province in the light of the pension queue chaos which has persisted throughout the year , long queues at day hospitals , a shortage of medicines , continued crime and urban terror in the province , the fact that a medical waste bill has not yet been introduced in the house and a range of other matters ?
the solution lies chiefly in ensuring that municipalities are paid rates for state-owned properties and for services they perform for other spheres of government ; it lies in municipalities sticking to providing good and effective basic services , rather pretending that they can offer services they cannot afford ; it lies in efficient , impartial debt collection ; and it lies in billing separately for all services that can be charged on a consumption basis .
mr speaker , if the hon premier is confident that these charges are baseless ; if he is confident of the support of his party ; if he is confident of the support of the dp , even though tony leon , the leader of the opposition in the national assembly , says that he does not want to blow wind or air into a dying party ; if he is confident that the charges of negligence , misleading the house and incompetence are baseless , let him have a ballot on the motion of no confidence .
the goals of this component for the following year are 300 in-house training courses , which amounts to a 50 % increase on the previous budget ; the outsourcing of computer literacy courses to the value of r1,2 million , which also amounts to a 50 % increase ; a third pep programme ; the establishment of a leadership program for officials , which is a cabinet priority ; basic skills training in isixhosa ; senior management courses ; liaison at the national and international levels with training counterparts ; increased focus on training in the rural areas of the province ; and the development of the second phase of the kromme rhee campus .
( a ) the period of training was as follows : three weeks ' basic protection course at paarl training college ; one week 's orientation at provincial protection services - i would like to remind hon members that i was hauled over the coals by the national minister of safety and security for giving cpos eight weeks ' training and he has given these people four weeks ' training ; four weeks in-service training under the supervision of permanent police officers ; further in-service training as part of the unit 's training goals for this year ; and each guard has an average of three years ' experience in the security field .
( 1 ) welcomes the intended visit by the public protector to smartie town on 19 april 2000 , and also expresses its concern that despite repeated allegations that new np councillor , mr jannie beukes , had authorised payments to the contractor before the houses were built , this councillor was elected as chairperson of the housing committee of the helderberg municipality with the support of the premier ; and ( 2 ) expresses the hope that the visit by the public protector will ensure that those responsible will be held accountable for their actions .
when there is wide-scale corruption ; when through their policies they are hostile to the employment of people and jobs are shed at an unprecedented rate ; when our fisherfolk go hungry and have to watch their cronies taking it all for themselves ; when our schools are collapsing as a result of farcical national policies , some of which are now being reversed ; when the justice system is collapsing ; and when crime has nullified the benefits of human rights and democracy as a result of the incompetence of the anc , they still expect our people to vote for them .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon adams whether , given that he told the house in march that the outstanding projects at that point amounted to r3,7 billion - and i am sure it will be agreed that it is a huge amount of money - it is still his intention to outsource the approvals of eias , or whether he is looking at some way of raising funds from the applications in order to apply that to improve the capacity of the department .
that the house appoints an ad hoc select committee to investigate and report on whether the minister in the office of the premier deliberately misled the scof hearing and further deliberately misled the house on 6 march 2000 , during the debate on vote 1 of the western cape appropriation bill on the non-existence and / or existence of a business plan for her ministry that deals with crucial matters of youth , gender , the disabled and poverty relief , the committee to have the power to call for papers and to hear evidence .
the committee , having heard and considered evidence on the above-mentioned treasury reply , wishes to express its serious concern at the fact that this matter has not received the necessary attention and recommends that , as a matter of principle and to emphasise the administration 's concern over public funds , immediate steps be taken towards the recovery of the misappropriated rdp monies from the ladismith municipality to prevent prescription , and that a report on the progress in this regard be submitted to the committee within 15 days of the date of this report .
mr speaker , the amendment of section 75 of law 4 of 1996 , which replaces subsection ( 3 ) , means that when any person is found guilty of an offence in terms of this law or pays an admission of guilt fine under section 75 of the criminal procedure act , 1977 ( act 51 of 1977 ) , such a person will also carry all costs incurred by the board and by the provincial administration : western cape which is now being included , and of course the saps , for transport expenses incurred and the storage of any gambling equipment and so on unless the court rules otherwise .
mr speaker , i would like to ask the hon premier the following : given that mr hernus kriel , who , in fact , played a central role in ensuring the election of the hon premier by actively lobbying against the election of his chief opponent , the hon member mr marais , and whose succession policy ensured this , has now joined the dp , and given also that his son has joined the anc , does he not think that these developments are a vote of no confidence in him as premier , as well as in the new np ?
mr speaker , in view of the fact that the charge on which the town clerk was found guilty has an element of dishonesty and in view of the fact that the town clerk is in a fiduciary position , entrusted with large sums of public money , does the hon minister of local government and development planning agree with the porterville council , whether or not it is pursuant to a legal opinion , that the town clerk acted in a personal capacity and that it was a private matter and therefore disciplinary proceedings are not called for ?
whether the membership of the western cape provincial tender board has been changed ; if so , ( a ) what procedures were followed to select the new members of the tender board , ( b ) what are the names of all the current members of the tender board broken down into their sector representation , ( c ) what are the gender and racial breakdown of the current membership , ( d ) what is the term of office served by each of the members on the tender board and ( e ) who is the ( i ) chairperson and ( ii ) vice-chairperson of the tender board ?
to enable the learners to write paper i ; after consultation with them , to give them a break and allow them to refresh themselves after completing paper i ; after that time to enable them to go back and write the paper that they had seen , which was creative writing ; and then to keep them at the principal 's house overnight , which they agreed to do , to ensure that they were not in contact with any of the other learners .
when it comes to new and small businesses that are starting up now , particularly transport enterprises , where the people have to pay through the nose for heavy vehicles and extra heavy vehicles and they may get contracts , for example to transport bricks for the casino in goodwood for a period of three months or six months , have they to pay the same money for a licence - which is calculated on the axle mass load - as the big companies like unitrans and others whose vehicles travel about 500 000 km to 1 million km with 30 tons to 40 tons on our roads every day ?
the subcommittee will , in my view , be able to look fruitfully at the involvement of all the portfolio committees in the budget process ; the discussion of committee reports and even their consideration in the house ; the involvement of the executive in the recommendations and discussions of committee reports ; the continuation of the good practice of having motions or subjects for discussion by parties on a regular basis ; the authorisation of portfolio committees to initiate and implement investigations ; and the elimination of the duplication of the committee stages , in which a committee of the whole house duplicates the standing committee .
according to anthony giddens , who pioneered the thinking around the " third way " in britain and has been the major adviser to the current labour government , a study they did at the university shows that the main beneficiaries of our r218 million allocated to institutions are indeed the middle classes , and that there are far too many layers of professionals , managers , administrators and so forth who benefit from our money before the left-overs of that process start to reach the people who actually should be the beneficiaries .
that this house notes the march on 15 march 2000 by 500 people in citrusdal under the banner of the anc to protest against liquor stores opening their doors to children and the local police station where it is believed that racism prevails , where a coloured person alleged to be drunk is treated brutally and more harshly than the white person who is accused of attempted murder ; where police shifts are divided according to race and where police visibility in the crime affected coloured area is poor and non existent ; where the senior management of the police are completely white ...
the anc in the western cape makes an urgent appeal to the top management of the police service - note , not the hon minister , because he cannot and will not do anything - to put steps in place by way of focused operations on the cape flats to make things safer ; to reallocate resources , as the hon member mr byneveldt said , to the crime-ravaged areas , and to ensure an urgent implementation plan to examine the impact of drug-dealing in the rural areas and to find emergency mechanisms to address them .
mr speaker , in this respect it is important to note that notwithstanding the fact that we acknowledge each individual 's human and constitutional rights and that we will strive to grant every individual what he or she is due in terms of the social assistance act , our assistance is aimed at the community at large , and our specific projects - both current and the ones we will endorse in future - intend to rather teach our people to fish than to give them fish .
the department of education to appoint truancy officers and to keep the children off the streets ; business against crime to install cameras in the manenberg area ; sports bodies for sports clinics and to extend the school day ; municipalities to do their basic municipal service provision - which i may say we are struggling with at the moment because we are dealing with cape town ; the national secretariat who are helping to declare the schools gun-free and also finance some of the projects ; the south african police service who are targeting shebeens amongst other gangster-related activities ; and the welfare department who are ensuring that home visits take place to restore family units .
to transfer the administration of the laws applicable to the western cape nature conservation board in terms of the nature and environmental conservation ordinance of 1974 , the environmental conservation act of 1989 , the seashore act of 1935 and the mountain catchment act of 1970 ; also to provide for a new definition of department ; to provide for an increase in the number of members of the board ; amend the provisions regarding the appointment and secondment of persons to the board ; and provide for matters incidental thereto .
over the past two and a half years , development planning has been the subject of a sica investigation , the principal purposes of which were , firstly , to ensure that the chief directorate fulfils its constitutional obligations as regards provincial planning , regional planning and urban and rural development ; secondly , to ensure that no overlap occurs between the roles and responsibilities of the various directorates and chief directorates within the province ; thirdly , to rightsize the personnel establishment of the chief directorate : development planning in order to ensure its efficient and effective functioning ; and , fourthly , to improve service delivery .
mr speaker , the commitment of the government will further be noticed when a support system has been put in place that will enable the people who have fallen out of the grant support system to survive ; when the people in k section , khayelitsha , site c , as well as the people in uitsig and elsies river - who are still squatting - have access to land and houses to enable them to lead a better life ; and when the mayor of the unicity has made up his mind to deliver on his election promises and supplies a free basic amount of water and other services to the poor .
when the anc campaigned in the 1999 elections and resulted in them becoming the biggest party in this province , they pledged to do five things : to reduce crime in the western cape by working with the national government ; to speed up housing delivery by making land available and ensuring that local government supplements the national subsidy ; to grow our economy and create new jobs and business opportunities ; to equalise resources for all the schools ; and to introduce tough measures to protect the environment .
i understand the circumstances of the poor ; i understand the dilemma of the victims of abuse , as the hon leader of the opposition has said , and the problems of the community ; the street children ; the single mothers and parentless childhood that many children of this province have to grow up in ; the disabled and the effect of hiv / aids on human beings in general , but especially on children and the poor , to mention only a number of the plights of our community which needs our understanding and sincere compassion , as the hon leader of the opposition has correctly stated .
the committee , having heard and considered evidence with regard to discrepancies in respect of payments to consultants which included original contracts not being available , the lack of proper certification of accounts and the lack of proper authority for a particular contract , wishes to express its concern and recommends that the necessary steps be taken to ensure that contracts entered into between all departments of the administration and consultants include detailed descriptions of what aspects are to be addressed , properly determines rates of compensation , defined time limits and outputs as well as any other condition which could be applicable to the relevant circumstances .
mr speaker , in my budget speech last february , i informed this parliament that the government of the western cape subscribed , without qualification , to the six so-called " clusters " for budget policies , which had been spelt out by the national government : meeting basic needs of the people ; accelerating infrastructure development ; laying the basis for sustained economic growth and job creation ; developing our human resources ; ensuring the safety and security of the citizen and the state ; and transforming the organs of government to reflect the developmental and people-centred nature of our democratic state .
mr speaker , the eighth amendment of the western cape gambling and racing law of 1996 is necessary to amend and to insert certain terminology in order to abolish licences for racecourses and racecourse premises ; to make exceptions in regard to the obligation to advertise certain licence applications ; to make provision for procedures obliging holders of operator licences to disclose to the board cheating and other infringements of the act or a similar act ; to regulate operating methods of licence holders ; and to make provision for declaring goods forfeit to the province in cases where an admission of guilt fine is paid and for related matters .
i therefore want to ask the hon minister and the department to address the following aspects : firstly , building the capacity of the family and making appropriate resources , services and support accessible to enable communities to support their orphans ; secondly , facilitating the mobilisation of communities to develop openness about hiv / aids so that families can access services as early as possible , with schools , churches , clinics , village development committees and burial societies involved in this mass mobilisation ; thirdly , informing communities regarding the impact of the aids epidemic , and the orphans in particular ...
that the house , in view of this week being national water week , and that the provincial government , in partnership with the tygerberg municipality , has launched a project in bongani , khayelitsha , to clean up the wetlands and waterway feeding into the kuils river , supports this initiative and thanks the more than 50 volunteer residents of the bongani informal settlement who are cleaning up the area , and further expresses the hope that this project will extend well beyond national water week , and if supplementary funding could be accessed from government and / or the private sector , it could carry on for an indefinite period , with the resultant benefit to the wetlands of the western cape .

2.3 the tender board , inter alia , gave evidence that in terms of section 5 ( 2 ) of the western cape provincial tender board law , 1994 ( law no 8 of 1994 ) the board may approve ex post facto any action of a provincial department whereby any power conferred upon the board by said law or the regulations , has been exercised , if the board is satisfied that such action of the provincial department concerned took place in emergency circumstances or was in the best interest of the province ; provided that it took place without negligence , and that the province did not suffer any damage as a result thereof .
they are , firstly , the reprioritisation of goals towards greater environmental sensitivity - r6,8 million , which equates to 23 % ; secondly , the phasing in of the planning and development act and its regulations - r5,8 million , which equates to 20 % ; thirdly , capacitating local government to do integrated development planning - r8,7 million , which equates to 29 % ; fourthly , the drafting and promotion of an effective provincial strategic plan - r3,8 million , which equates to 13 % ; fifthly , the effective participation of local government in provincial goals and objectives - r2,6 million , which equates to 9 % ; and , finally , the outsourcing of activities - r1,7 million , which equates to 6 % .
matters that the department of transport and the standing committee could and must consider - and this may possibly offer us a solution to the dilemma that we are faced with - include inter alia : the enforcement of existing legal contracts ; the protection of commuters and their right to use the transport of their choice ; keeping open channels of communication for further and sustained discussions and negotiation ; considering the entire issue of subsidisation of public transport in general ; the legalising and issue of permits and the use of routes ; and a search for solutions to the tension that prevails currently as a result of competition and the market , on the one hand and survival , particularly of taxi owners , on the other .
