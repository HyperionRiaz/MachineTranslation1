yes , we know .
that is true .
that is gratifying .
no schools !

that is important .
everything is open .
this is unacceptable .
bash the unions !
i thank him .
i am coming to that .
i have not .
there we go .
house in committee :
questions were answered .
what happens now ?
he has been released !
what governs ministers ?
and his employer .
in what respect ?
forget the millions !
am i right ?
are the allegations true ?
that is a reality .
a more efficient police force .
no , they have not .
the balance are whites .
what is the solution ?
the legislation is available .
now it is checkmate .
they can scrutinise it .
house resumed : bill reported with amendment .
we need to look after it .
because they are black ?
i will investigate it .
it is a query .
the list goes on .
he kept them out .
we do not say that .
yes , they are running scared .
well , they do not .
is that a question ?
how many people must die ?
i move further :
blacks are racist too .
coloureds are racist too .
what did you say ?
why are you criticising it ?
it is much appreciated .
they are the following .
i am looking at them again .
the minister of education :
a policy would do .
i could not hear .
this happens time and again .
i am definitely going to allow it .
in the direction of home or work ?
they did the specifications .
this is something that hurts agriculture .
i hope they are listening now .
they rape , rob and murder .
the same percentages apply to vehicles .
that is on the table .
these are the issues .
who are prosecuting ?
that is not nice .
it is happening .
let me give an example .
there was not a word .
it makes one think .
all of us have a responsibility .
oh , what a racist remark !
i withdraw that statement .
" they sit on the tail .
they did very well .
are they really aware of that ?
it is a unique project .
they make so many mistakes .
he has probably gone .
the answer reads as follows :
the same applies to rural communities .
it is a critical fund .
to me that is reprehensible .
that was never the idea .
they dealt with the problem themselves .
this leads to serious disciplinary problems .
i am talking about those other jews .
the answer is a deafening silence .
it is fairly comprehensive , strict legislation .
which councils spent the money ?
our letter read as follows :
what machine are we talking about now ?
and then there is nick botha .
it was truly outstanding investigative journalism .
each member has three questions .
we do not know ; we are asking you .
that strategy cannot work .
i will take that into account .
there is no such thing !
our treasury dealt with this exhaustively .
i am committed to this country .
sir , the third area is procurement .
bill read a second time .
bill read a third time .
his interests will have to be declared .
he should know better .
tolerance went out of the window .
no solutions are in sight .
there are black people who are excluded .
we know where we stand with regard to that .
why do they carry on over that ?
they have come to their senses .
then i have to cut that cake .
it can be submitted again later .
because there is an investigation into it .
that was done with my concurrence .
i am not aware of it .
it was not a march .
i will speak to the department about that .
of course i agree with him absolutely .
i have nothing to do with that .
one cannot alienate principals .
we are talking about one or two words .
we must bring life back into the city .
therefore , it just does not make sense .
yes , but we are now attracting the votes .
that is why we wanted to change it .
i cannot but say amen to all of those .
that issue , in itself , is very important .
no , this cannot be right .
i will not simply close everything .
it is appropriate that we discuss that .
but we would get nowhere with that .
not to take evidence !
why did they not do it ?
they had to pay people to work .
so you are not authorising this amount .
that is my understanding of the matter .
the time for just talking is past .
i know exactly who i am talking about .
his address will also make a difference .
i do not have that before me .
he should listen to the other side .
wishes to report as follows :
we must stop seeking excuses for criminals .
that is what is behind all of this .
here they say , and i quote further :
but we did not say that !
next i want to refer to the departments .
i did that for a purpose .
we can no longer tolerate crime .
absolutely nothing is happening in those schools .
i have some genuinely good news .
that is by the end of march .
i repeat what i said earlier .
i just wonder how successful this is going to be .
what criteria are used when allocations are made ?
we can only do what we can .
we will support them in doing so .
together we can and will make that difference .
of course , we need to strengthen these in this financial year .
we should hand those projects over after three years .
i really take my hat off to him there .
i believe , however , that that would have been dishonest .
there are some people who benefit from it .
make an effective delivery of your speech now !
i shall also make a few remarks about that .
you are on the way to the barber .
what has that to do with this matter ?
which we all know they lost .
no , sir , i do not have the time for that .
scof has the power to investigate it .
yet , we are authorising it .
let us get this session over with .
we have a lot to be thankful for .
not a word was said about that .
what is the process involved here ?
they should give me an opportunity now .
are you saying that these businesses are not ?
i take it that the motion will be adopted .
there is no sustainable development for farm workers .
many of them have been here since then .
that is the word i used .
yet we find incidents like this happening .
they are there for everyone to read .
we certainly do not have a problem with that !
yes , we can come forward with new ideas .
the youth are of particular concern to us .
we are not claiming credit for anything .
there , it is not business as usual .
i would like to thank him for his patience .
yes , but we have gone a little further .
sir , it is working ; we are going to the people .
but let us leave that for the moment .
there are three areas i would like to speak about .
there must be criminal investigations where these are warranted .
according to rumour this will not be the case .
we expect them to exercise their leadership .
maybe there is some positive reason for his not being there .
firstly , the lack of nursing staff remains a problem .
paying patients can afford to be choosy .
today he said nothing about any legislation .
on my recommendation the process is not being terminated .
he probably had not read the whole newspaper report .
the spreadsheet is currently being updated with inputs from departments .
i certainly did not take the decision on my own .
there must be a lifestyle and behavioural modification .
i would like to know who received this tender .
i think we need to show that it is our baby .
not all are converted on the same evening .
let us disagree with each other in this house by all means .
again , people have not consulted the act .
the committee concluded its deliberations on the bill .
the committee did , however , note the following :
we all know what happened to their relationship .
it is not a point of order necessarily .
to us it is about the delivery of service .
cash should not be kept on the farm .
of the cape town city council , and a director , was present .
there can be no false notes in this regard .
the chair does not really have a problem with that .
i am not going to go into detail about this .
in fact , he did have a point here and there .
they will not be able to make a major breakthrough .
this raises many questions about the provincial government .
if they differ with me , they should say so .
he has only a certain role to play .
i would like to single out someone very special , my father .
i thank the very efficient chair of those proceedings .
one cannot achieve it that way .
i believe we require an exercise like that .
not much was mentioned in this regard in the debate today .
one cannot alienate any one of those sectors .
we may boast that we have the best matriculation pass rate today .
the category cannot be the sole determining factor .
it is incredible to see how it has improved .
i said in september that i would do it .
mr speaker , i move :
we are heading for the local government elections later this year .
do not ask me what they all do .
whether they will keep me there for longer , i do not know .
we hope that a similar situation will not occur .
we should be able to create jobs through transport and public works .
we do not have to do this publicly .
the staff of the department know that i support them .
i had to agree to it because of the urgency of the matter .
not as fruit , but in a snide way ?
i think there is no comparison between the two .
that is one of the most important things in our communities .
the plan must now be established and positive action must follow .
we have inherited a sophisticated infrastructure on which to build .
i would like to make a ruling on points of order .
that is why we believe that government needs to step in .
we are not prepared to politicise this issue .
my constituency is khayelitsha and i live in that situation .
the amendment i have before me is as follows :
bill not referred to committee of the whole house .
the accuser is the community that established that democracy .
it did not happen yesterday , but it does happen .
this was a symbolic gesture , in order to get publicity .
it was a rape , and we warned them about it .
may the almighty spare him for many , many more years .
it is a pity that we have to tell one another this .
it is in a letter that landed on my desk .
we can do that , and the fund could be monitored .
at the time the budget for the current financial year had already been finalised .
where inequality is great and radically defined , democracy is the victim .
i thank them for that and for their change of mind .
i challenge you to say that outside this house .
it sometimes takes a bit of hard bargaining to get them here .
it is a good point , however , and we shall look into it .
this is another phenomenon that characterises the nature of change .
are the schools getting on to a more equal basis ?
up to today we do not know what has happened there .
i referred to my ministry , not the department .
he referred very selectively to certain sections in the constitution .
every time he switches sides as easily as the wind changes direction .
in my opinion , it can only be interpreted in one way .
one is to start rumour-mongering .
it will not be broken up and go to any other organisations .
i ask that you rule that debate be conducted in an orderly fashion .
are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice ?
we initiated them and we will certainly continue doing that .
the coalition is working well despite attempts to make it stumble .
bill not referred to committee of the whole house .
for the moment these are the schedules that we would like to deal with .
that is the point we are making .
i have seen the lines of suffering and sorrow on faces .
however , she cannot motivate now .
this in itself can never be a reason for murder .
that is the kind of watchdog that we are dealing with here .
it appears to be an all-out war against the state .
that is why i say that we should stand together .
i am sorry for the colleagues who had to go that way .
i have the fullest confidence that my views will be realised .
it is simply because those schools do not have equipment .
i do not for one minute believe that matters are going to get better .
no advertisement goes out before it has been properly evaluated .
the issue here is the lack of implementation of policy .
they discard the rest and lay it at somebody else 's door .
when did you tell them to appoint a consultant ?
he is an acting judge , who may become a judge .
what i want to point out here is the way employment is being handled .
one can look at his speech and see the answers there .
we , too , must take our places like people who appreciate their responsibility .
a copy of my speech is in the stack of documents in front of him .
and in order to do this we need to further stimulate our economy .
this is one of the areas of my greatest concern .
many others simply do not know what is going on .
i am wholly committed to reversing this negative trend .
possibly not everyone will agree , but those are our statistics at present .
we can therefore proceed and hopefully settle the matter as soon as possible .
the development is expected to be completed in the next two years .
there are thousands of our people who have been there for years .
i want to congratulate our department on the outstanding implementation of this programme .
we will not , by doing this , be encroaching upon the autonomy of local governments .
then development could progress more rapidly and not get so far behind .
the trend for this region is precisely the same as it is nationally .
these new rules of the game present substantial challenges to companies and to our regions .
there is a perception that tax on mechanisation will promote labour-intensive practices .
however , we need more resources to do this job adequately .
i would like to congratulate them on their magnificent wins thus far .
while we are talking about that , let us bring it back to the western cape .
nowadays they make allegations that i do not want to cooperate with them .
now we ask the question : did the other provinces do this too ?
one can see that they have had a difficult day .
let me reply to a number of the issues raised .
i wanted us to stand by what we stand for .
perhaps this signifies the importance he attaches to the debate .
this is not and cannot be subjected to discussion .
up to now they have had nothing to be ashamed of .
are there any objections to the motion being moved without notice ?
as i always say , promote the positive and get rid of the negative .
unfortunately , at the moment we have a coalition which divides instead of unites .
what is more , the eastern cape is awash with borrower funding .
the full amount will be spent by the end of this financial year .
we are in the process of developing our own provincial policy .
what then happened was an attempt to nurse the project .
where in the document does it say that posts are reserved for people ?
a very important fact to consider is the influence of absenteeism .
i am aware of the fact that things are not easy in this regard .
i urge the department to consider this source of revenue seriously .
we should use it to save the province from uniformity and mediocrity .
more people , particularly the frail aged , would then be able to go into those homes .
this is inevitable , and the national government is going to implement it throughout the country .
more details about this will be announced during the course of the year .
one does not have to go far to find proof of this .
these are matters which are very close to my heart .
secondly , we have to get joint agreements from the municipalities in that specific area .
it was a service that was jointly decided upon and jointly expanded .
his ministry will propose appropriate institutional arrangements to resolve this debate .
it concerns us , as we see there is a lot of emphasis on planning .
this would not have happened , i believe , in a white school .
they may become a priority in future , but we are still talking about it .
we are all unhappy about the allocation , but what can we do about it ?
i thank them for adding lustre and charm to the occasion .
one moment they apply it , the next moment democracy does not suit them .
at that stage we were not faced with the same situation .
why are our innocent children executed , maimed and raped on a daily basis ?
what steps can i take to stop myself from saving ?
but it is equally important to make the people of the western cape secure .
we are dealing with state moneys as agents and therefore it has to be dealt with properly .
there are two or three cameras which could cover a fairly substantial area .
i then put the second part of this amendment , which reads as follows :
it is untrue and that is definitely not their standpoint .
i ask him to do so again formally after this ruling .
violence is the norm and murders are often committed with seemingly gratuitous cruelty .
this province has all the resources at its disposal to deal with crime .
i do not think it is fair to our people in the western cape .
i believe that any idea that anyone comes up with deserves investigation and consideration .
in fact , there are very few africans in these posts .
every political party knows precisely where the programme is and when it is .
is it parliamentary to tell a member that he is racist ?
when he was in health , he knew that we had shortages .
the people 's interpretation is that they are not safe in their society .
many crimes committed against them are of a sexual nature or sex related .
the educational interests and rights of children in the classroom are all too often ignored .
it is sometimes very difficult to change them , but it is urgently necessary .
the result is this budget , which , though not yet optimal , is a start .
i was haunted by the very real possibility of legal actions against the board and me .
the president also gave awards , especially in this province .
in his budget speech he spent some considerable time on the state of local governments .
i think he said that he was on page three and a half .
most notably , we shall define in a very different manner what culture is .
i want to name a few examples , as it raises the question of criteria .
i also wish the department well with its budget in the new year .
in the third place , the tourism board is involved in several development projects at schools .
more criminals walk free than are apprehended and put into jail .
sir , i do not say that we should be blind to problems on farms .
in fact , i asked whether the gentleman should be paid .
i do not know ; i cannot tell you , but as soon as it is ready .
that national legislation takes precedence over whatever we are concerned with now .
this is an extremely wrong principle that people are following in this regard .
that is the question that the farm workers ask every day , during my rural visits as well .
perhaps he was right when he said that we are today talking to him .
perhaps it is steps of this kind that we need to take in the process in future .
nobody in the house should become idle bystanders to the practice of racial discrimination .
let me say again , i am born of this country and this continent .
then there is creating an enabling environment for economic growth .
i say today with passion that i will not let that happen .
as yet there is no indication that this trend will reverse .
they did not have too much fault to find with the essence of the story .
if a business wants to perform , it invests in its own infrastructure and systems first .
what i do have a say in regard to is how they must be utilised at what stations .
we said that we would do something for him and forward it .
i have just been to beaufort west the past weekend , which is another classic case in point .
and that that is the sort of communism that he wants to import into our province ?
the directorate has directed much of its energy and limited financial resources to these ends .
if we want to be proud of our province , the good things have to be communicated .
we can blame forever , and certainly , where blame is due , it must be accepted .
the sign , used subsequently in the same speech , indicates the original language .
i do not think that just anyone can do that .
what earth-shattering difference are we going to see in health between last year and this coming year ?
he goes further , in fact , and says that he is not going to leave any stone unturned .
i must make it absolutely clear that local government is a sphere on its own .
it has always been my view that agriculture must be approached from an economic point of view .
on the other hand i think that some of the farmers are shooting us in the foot .
we are regularly sent to the open graves , but there is no urgency .
i must add that when he gets under way , he reminds me of john vorster .
it is that spiritual revival , as i would call it , that must take place within those communities .
that has nothing to do with it and it is something we can handle another day .
at that time , was he applying his mind to that and from where did the savings come ?
the first priority is the provision of security to all the people of the western cape .
the committee wishes to express its appreciation for the submissions provided by provincial departments .
i used almost the same wording that i used in the standing committee .
if the bill is agreed to today , a limited number of types will be given to me .
recently a farmer hanged him up by his ankles in a store .
we are all tired of wringing our hands and expressing sympathy .
they wanted to move the school into an area that was next to an open drain .
in politics there is a time to come and a time to go .
i want to recognise that and thank them most sincerely for the service they gave .
it is something they do not realise and they do not recognise it .
what he said was that technology was now being employed , because machines do not go on strike .
nor will it help us to stretch the money that we have .
a programme for unemployed women with children under the age of five years has been introduced .
i fully intend to extend existing and new international cooperation agreements .
i could have signed it , because a lot of documents cross my desk every day .
the act refers to provincial ministers , and he did not necessarily assume the responsibility .
i know the fellows there , i know who the men are who are in charge .
they might have been able to do that , but do they really need more egg on their faces ?
as it has been put into operation , it is unfair and they are indeed going to change it .
it is not only a pleasure , but also an honour for me to know them .
fortunately it will be possible to advertise the vacant posts before long , and that should bring some relief .
i also wish to convey my sincere thanks to the chairperson and members of the standing committee .
i want to thank the local governments and congratulate them on their participation in some of these programmes .
the act has not yet been proclaimed , but there is a good document on the table .
i hope and trust that the board will not be appointed and driven by officials .
it is important and i believe that we have been doing the correct thing in this regard .
there are times , particularly at the start of a debate , when the pot boils over a little .
there are documents in the bags that i will be referring to in the course of my speech .
in fact , the plan was originally opposed by the national government and the national department of health .
it is wonderful to see that business is now also putting its money where its mouth is .
and when i say this , i am prepared to walk the talk .
the moment the challenge is there , they start giving it a different name .
every year pharmaceutical companies invest billions of rands in research aimed at the broadening of medicine .
our colleagues here have worked through them , and they have been identified and agreed upon .
what is a requirement , is that at least two types of municipalities per category must be established .
i ask you to give a ruling on it in order that this precedent not be created .
when i say this , i do not say that the motion that was moved is not important .
i am pleased to see that this is also contained in the bill .
i stated in the press as well that he is a liar , and he knows it .
her references to children and the aged are critical issues that we need to look at in the province .
does it mean that if one does not support a person , that person must punish one ?
show me the man or woman who has the nuts and bolts to fix the past .
i have raised this issue previously in the house , but i want to raise it again today .
there is much to be told about the moral leadership of the police service in this province .
why did he not look at the situation of all the victims of the tornado ?
they build new houses for the coloured workers and build nothing for the black workers .
i am being very honest when i say that i am digging myself in there .
sir , let me show that there is political interference in this process .
whether that period is nine months or three months or three days makes no difference .
let us pull together because the situation is far too serious to do otherwise .
what i am saying here is that one does not have to get emotional about the matter .
i have also had the regular experience of visiting classrooms to find no teacher in them .
the first point i want to mention is the way in which monetary allocations are made to schools .
i think he is a remarkable man to work with two ministers and two departments .
many people got wiser from the initiatives taken in the office of the premier .
another objective is putting new structures in place for the transformation of local government .
what is very clear to all of us is that poverty affects a particular class within our society .
the moneys received have been channelled to a few major projects which are due to start this year .
truly , it is always a privilege to serve under him and to be of assistance to him .
that is why i addressed this invitation , let us create an environment in which everyone can make money .
i can see that he has gained good training in public transport in recent times .
murders , rapes and crime on the cape flats are merely crime on the cape flats .
the police have also achieved a great deal of success after the death of the children on the cape flats .
he said the savings also came from posts that were frozen , and so forth .
it was a speech which would undoubtedly have left many people in this province satisfied and reassured .
they must leave the pipes alone as well as certain railways , but why are all airports and harbours excluded ?
i admit that i am not entirely capable of really placing the whole matter in perspective .
i would like to thank the chairperson and members of the standing committee who dealt with this matter .
after all , that is the sacred purpose of the intelligence service , to ensure that they are infiltrated .
we are accused of not looking after the interests of the young democracy sufficiently .
they know , of course , that the national minister of labour has said that a code of conduct will be drawn up .
equally important are the rules of this house , and the respect we accord to the chair .
i was there that morning when the election took place , and they simply did not want to take part .
thousands of teachers who supported this government at that time have received a slap in the face .
that family are of a certain colour that he might not recognise as being part of his world .
those people who did not have the opportunity to vote will now be able to do so .
it is the fastest-growing epidemic in the world , and we are leaving behind a generation of orphans .
here there is simply no room to serve the people of our province with dignity .
all were educators who have come from schools where they had caused major problems in the past .
i want to know whether she is satisfied with that and whether she is aware of any particular problems .
however , none of the participants of the project registered for the course , which unfortunately , had to be cancelled .
the central government had nothing to do with his cabinet resolutions , and we have copies of those .
how real is the concept of freedom if the padlock to economic freedom remains solid and intact ?
let us not suddenly , with the protection we enjoy here , criticise the winner of the licence .
we had to wait for the lead of the national government in this regard before planning for ourselves .
one cannot only talk about sport for children and then leave the parents behind .
these are some of the negative aspects that i found while visiting my constituency .
i want to refer to what is happening in the western cape , specifically with regard to this branch .
agriculture should run the farming activity and it should be run as one of its small farms .
there are , however , still certain shortcomings in municipalities , including the fact that complaints are not responded to .
the sooner we can get national government going , the sooner we shall be able to get on with transformation .
we obtained the relevant court order and instructed a company to carry out the demolition .
we are expecting the same delivery while we are throwing our levels of commitment to the financial plan out of the window .
i believe very passionately in developing the content of the strategic objective that he presented .
those are the types of mechanisms that we have to consider dealing with the huge problem of enforcement .
in addition there is a communal toilet that they use but it is out of order more often than not .
moreover there is a surplus , so they can do so with pleasure ; it will help all of us .
to achieve this goal , effective communication with all the communities of the western cape will be a greater priority .
we are going to win the constitutional court case and then you will not have to register in that way .
this goes to the nub of the seriousness of what is going on in this country today .
municipal structures act and selected portions of it , out of a position of weakness , wondering what they could retain .
the provincial government also have the express responsibility to see to it that they perform their functions effectively .
we do not , however , subscribe to the misguided view that judges and their pronouncements are always above criticism .
i am not here to discuss the matter with him today at a personal level .
no gain can be had by any party riding the tiger of opportunism in this context .
people will say that the second part of the motion includes some degree of politicking , and so on .
all citizens of the province have to be secure , not only those who live in the better areas .
he knew that he would never again be in the cabinet as far as this party is concerned .
we cannot always simply say that the national government has not given us the funds .
that is one of the major factors that we are encountering at the moment , which we will have to look into .
we must accept that the area has grown ; it has grown faster than the system .
we are also proud to say that we can see that there is progress in this department .
this will lead to an even greater boost in quality of life in our province , which i referred to earlier .
this leaves the impression that this is a form in which the old order still seeks to survive .
there is a high level of commitment from the teachers , even under these difficult conditions .
it is state policy to send young doctors out to peripheral hospitals and clinics to do their year of community conscription .
of course , my department and i are not the only ones who deserve credit for the good progress being made .
before starting my prepared speech , however , i would like to thank the officials of the department of housing .
one cannot deny that there are municipalities that , despite these difficulties , are financially and administratively stable .
in fact , 50 people from that area have volunteered to assist us with the project , with no reward .
the speed at which this happened was incredible , but two years later the act was not yet in force .
in earlier years , when i was young , we thought that in agriculture the farmer makes you his slave .
i need not reiterate , as i did recently in my budget speech , everything that my department is doing .
if he feels that mismanagement took place , he should stand up in the house and ask for an inquiry .
if she wants to know how i run my department , she should wait until i apply for my budget .
if we focus on issues of this kind we will improve the quality of life of the people in the western cape .
i could issue instructions now to close them , but what would happen to those half million people ?
i can give the house a copper-bottomed guarantee that any future contributions will be in terms of different agreements .
as i understood it , there was an agreement with the acting chief whip that the error would be corrected .
as a result we as a black majority were never able to share in the organised and formal agricultural sector .
when he did do this , on the same day he was first assaulted and then chased off the farm .
if we can achieve that alone , we will be well on our way to a better future for all .
it was only after the last incident , in a reasonably long list of incidents , that there was active intervention .
that is why i was in the streets of khayelitsha yesterday , talking about the responsibility of men .
i genuinely believe that that borders on contempt of this house , and certainly of the people that he represents .
another special day is international day for the elimination of racial discrimination , but i will get to that later .
the poorest of the poor in this country and in the province are deprived by circumstances of all rights .
our participation in this critical national debate will continue , especially in those areas to which we give priority .
he mentioned a very important issue , which was the inconvenience to commuters , certainly during the height of the conflict .
is it both the bill and the regulations , or only some of the regulations that flow out of the bill ?
i hope and trust that in this way we will be able to continue helping the needy people in the community .
it is unpleasant for the people , it is not right and nobody should have to live in such conditions .
having said that , a certain member of the clergy knows better than us that the devil is often in detail .
the voters ' rolls have to be brought up to date and the parents have to be elected to the management bodies for a month or two .
after being trained by these developers , our people are employed temporarily for the duration of the project .
strategic development programme has been established to coordinate specific functions that the department of transport contributes to service delivery for our clients .
as we all know , the department of transport 's ability to generate its own revenue is its lifeline .
the school had a serious problem with its toilets , which were in a very serious state of disrepair .
it was a very noble gesture to bring it up in the house and i support him in that regard .
however , minister after minister has come and one has heard them saying that they declare war against crime .
in that way one could ultimately try , as far as any initiative in the province is concerned , to get the support of everyone as far as possible .
i have allowed speakers on this side and that side of the house to address me on this .
therefore the money could not be spent and accordingly it was possible to make this amount available from savings .
yes , we could have used the money for the brown issues , but it was not under my portfolio .
he should not authorise it , as with hindsight he will see that this was the wrong decision .
it is there that one is actually creating the people who can grasp the opportunities to go into the future .
i want to convey my appreciation for the fact that the safety of the inhabitants of the western cape is the top priority of this government .
they should bear in mind that a mistake cannot be repeated in order to rectify another mistake .
the first half of the morning was spent listening to what the banks themselves had to say .
die intelligensie staan in diens van die staat en is ' n demokratiese verantwoording verskuldig aan die regering van die dag .
the people of our province are feeling insecure , from those in the office of the premier to the least amongst us .
they could dislike us for that and not because of our race or colour .
on the other hand i accept that members of the opposition have a crucial role to play as an opposition .
the time has come , without doubt , for the interests of the people to be put first by the opposition too .
whilst there is deregulation of the sector at the national level , there is much more regulation at the global level .
eight and a half months is eight and a half months too long to struggle without these essential services .
we owe it to our farm workers not to allow the benefits experienced by other sectors to pass them by .
when we talk about transformation it is important to distinguish between three important issues in order to get clarity .
we obviously cannot deregister them , but we do anticipate many of them will fail .
he does not read the magazines or newspapers or listen to the radio , because i am shining !
it is sad to have to mention that no significant transformation of education has been initiated by this province .
this agreement will have to be negotiated to spell out the role of all the parties who take part in the process .
this makes one grasp the extent of the need that we have to deal with , and of the need that could still confront us .
they wanted to proceed with the appointment of a town clerk , but they were persuaded that they could use the services of a nearby municipality .
that framework is going to lay down the basic guidelines on how all development in the medium and long term takes place in the province .
this is not simply appropriate transport , as is stipulated in one of the documents , but an integrated public transport system .
we shall carry him , because he carries the message of reconciliation , hope and confidence , where it is very necessary .
it is actually a shocking indictment of the public servants of this province and also the head of the public servants in the province .
sir , these requests came from the central government , and this province bent over backwards to comply with these requests .
in fact , there were a number of volunteers from the public service who volunteered for this task .
he was informed accordingly and for that reason he left the house in order to abstain from voting .
i do not know whether we in the western cape are really concerned about the aged and the women of this province .
if one takes that family as a representative of families in the city , one will know their terror and fear .
we have been afforded the opportunity to join the initiative , and the western cape is grabbing it with both hands .
it means a representative on that board and that means bringing other people in to normalise the situation .
just because one owns a home , that side of the house suggests one can pay unlimited amounts of money .
she and the white mineworkers ' union representative spoke the same language , while , ironically , others got up and differed with it .
the chair was notified that the motion would probably be withdrawn , but it has not officially been withdrawn .
he referred the case to the director of public prosecutions for finality as to whether or not he should prosecute .
however , what happened yesterday in the house gave the impression that there were no rules in the house .
it was almost as if it was expected that people in that area would die in the way in which they do .
is it the department of doing nothing , or is it a department dealing with gender , youth and the disabled ?
political will is a difficult thing , but political will is something that is born out of a passion to put matters right .
i do believe that we should take a great deal of care to see that we do not make the same mistake in the future .
when he is not able to criticise anything or thinks that things are not going right , he blames apartheid .
what we did was we closed down the one school , which means ipso facto , one could argue , an amalgamation .
the answer is really to speed up the system and to unstop the blockages that we are experiencing .
the moment we get national legislation , it will be easy to change to the national legislation and that framework .
sir , i wish to focus more on the role that the department of development planning will in future play together with local government .
we have here , firstly , the figures for the entire department of planning , local government and housing , and i want to go through those .
we should make resources and a strategy available that will confirm the status of the western cape as the cultural leader among the provinces .
this act makes provision for the rights of the aged under the constitution and was passed to combat abuse of the elderly .
sir , one of the members of the community that came to see me on friday and asked for protection was murdered today .
in his book he writes that one has to win the emotions of the population and get them on one 's side .
they should go and listen to what the national minister of safety and security says he envisages doing to resolve the situation .
the regulations of the police stipulate that if a march takes place or if there is a strike , there has to be a police presence .
only hard work brings success , and the kind of success that a premier , a cabinet , leadership and a parliament can be proud of .
we cannot and may not allow law and order to be undermined and to allow people to act above the law .
it does not mean that one cannot do it ; it simply means one has to follow the right procedures .
when i have done that and i am then satisfied that there is a need for an inquiry , we will do that .
it should be given to any other person so that when we discuss hotels , the rest of us do not become worried about it .
this requires of the employer and the employee to plan together , communicate effectively and , more important , to care about one another .
i can go through this list and say that these nine objectives will become the gauge by which the government can be measured .
however , one thread has been running through this debate , and that is the threat of racism , of which this side of the house is being accused .
their only salvation in life was to have a " dop " every now and then because they had lost their jobs .
one cannot in a short time eradicate apartheid and apartheid policies , and poverty , and build an economy for poor people .
however , we have to accommodate a process of public participation here , and the regulation and the act will have to be dealt with concurrently , unfortunately .
we may be looking at a different way of outsourcing in terms of the department appointing consultants at the expense of the developer .
yesterday i visited three people who had been very seriously injured on a train travelling between cape town and khayelitsha .
he further stated that if anyone had any questions on the matter they should direct them to the national government .
the money was therefore paid out to the professionals on that basis and there will certainly be no interest on that .
my only discontent about this action is that it was done through other structures and the provincial government was kept in the dark .
if i were to ask where the member is who should be sitting in that bench , the reply would be that they do not know .
we have the greatest access to these tools right here in our province , yet why do we not celebrate these achievements more often ?
let us , all of us on both sides of this house , form a team and work together in the best interest of all our people .
such a flight would surely be an indicator of a loss of confidence in the system and certainly could be detrimental to the system .
no less than three companies have approached me with the news that they might be forced to close down if the situation does not change .
i do not think that such a sophisticated and educated person as he ought to make a statement of that nature in this house .
we need to look to the future and help our people on the way to prosperity , and not always stick in the past .
most businessmen that addressed the summit said that they had not had a holiday in the past two years .
i am being very honest with him , i do not have figures relating to how much money came from planning , local government or housing .
furthermore , that office will enable us to attend congresses and conferences without necessarily incurring heavy expense .
if one actually stands up and makes statements like that , one is impugning the integrity of individuals that really want to make a contribution .
what we must say to one another is that we must be able to implement this legislation consistently in our communities when it becomes law .
statistics show that the inputs made thus far to prevent this form of crime have not been very successful .
in other words , it is a question put before the house to consider and to make a decision on .
the defence also argues with conviction that the guilty party can be none other than the predecessor of democracy , apartheid .
let me point out three principles , and illustrate how they operate in practice in this situation .
the employment it creates and the general spin-offs and natural competition between developers are what economic competition is all about in a free market .
by the way , within the very first week the mayor used the mayoral fund and went off to worcester to buy herself a few smart outfits .
it is that kind of racism which prevents an effective government from delivering to the poorest of the poor in the province .
the scourge is then further entrenched by the family , who do not want to speak about it and the embarrassment that has befallen the community .
if i had been in a position to do so , it would probably have taken us three hours to do that .
again , we must not lose sight of the fact that rural development and its implementation must be planned in conjunction with the local authorities .
it is also interesting to note that the western cape is the most desirable place to live , according to that report .
the outcome of these discussions will give a clear mandate to sport organisations to fulfil their respective roles in a meaningful and constructive manner .
although this is not much money , it is important that we see to it that every cent is used for the purpose for which it is intended .
perhaps these issues should be publicly debated because they affect the future of the constitution and the freedom of all citizens .
we must stop hearing how the great trees are falling and rather stand quietly and listen to the little trees growing , just as this desk will grow .
in the past year we have had a few communities marching to our buildings to protest their need for housing .
i will now deal with the specific points , and i would rather stick to the facts than deal with the person himself .
this is indeed good news for our new matriculants who have the dedication , ambition and drive to enter these markets .
he said that the volunteers would receive no monetary compensation , but that they would find a way of assisting them .
are we in the house not also trying to canvass votes with the blood of people 's lives ?
fourthly , the issue is not legal versus illegal , if the issue is violence and intimidation , power and the infringement of rights .
we are going to give them the opportunity , however minor , to form part of that process and take it forward .
once again we are in a situation in which we complain and talk about it and so on , but when do we proceed to action ?
in addition , the bill paves the way for the potential separation at a later stage of horse-racing from gambling in terms of legislation and regulation .
the only other point that has been made is that because he owns hotels which are in the vicinity , there is a conflict of interest .
if employers and employees in the agricultural industry endeavour to achieve this , a fine future awaits agriculture in the western cape .
one of my requests is that when promises are made to schools , however limited , they must not be empty promises .
we have long experience of an education department that drove everyone to distraction with promises which ultimately proved to be empty .
the fact is that i have ministers who also address these things , and that is why i said that my ministers would come .
was he aware that his department 's opinion and submission were submitted as the official submission on behalf of the provincial parliament of the western cape ?
i think that we as a community should also take those people by the hand and escort them to a place where they can be cared for .
however , if we by education , job creation and that sort of thing can raise the standard of living of our people , that is what we will do .
the matter is currently being addressed by the west coast district council , the provincial department of local government and housing and the national department of public works .
we welcome the fact that a report will be submitted to the treasury on this matter , but we on this side of the house want to go further .
we are not sure why this is taking place , but is very clear to us that it is happening .
often it is impossible simply to decide yes or no , left or right , white or black ; then no decision is also a possibility .
he has said countless times when questioned that he will do this , but the details are again not here .
he pointed out very clearly that the assets of the western cape do not lie in minerals , but in its natural beauty and , in particular , in its people .
it has not happened for the simple reason that we are dealing with a general effort to get this centre on the go .
the people on the cape flats voted for the government and it is the moral duty of the government to protect their children .
however , for that to happen , the people who are meant to be the leaders of society have to play a more positive role .
they delude themselves by saying that we are only getting better and that the economy is growing , it is booming .
those who speak about the issue of race will tell one that it is about speaking about those who are poor .
how is that side of the house going to make sure it becomes a reality , because it definitely is not a reality at the moment .
people who want to come to cultural events but are unable to do so because of some or other obstacles or impediments , must be assisted .
i am talking about young boys who grow up surrounded by gang members who try to lure them into a life of theft and drug abuse .
i believe that it gives this province a genuine opportunity to make an effort to cut out criminality before it starts .
if we do not do that , we will not be able to counteract the setbacks suffered by the province recently .
they should try and find out how we can manage it in an effective way for the benefit of the people in the province and the whole of the country .
in addition , input from ordinary members would also allow for a greater debate on where we would seek cooperative agreements and avoid any embarrassment that this may cause .
one should not try to be an authority if one says that one is still new , because then one has to suffer the consequences .
the one thing that we are determined to do , and we are going to roll it out further , is taking cabinet to the people .
however he sees the questions , whether he sees them as too long or too unfair , he would have to deal with that politically in answering the questions .
the reality of the matter is that there are a number of people who are entering there and some of them cannot even speak english or afrikaans .
sport and recreation should be an important aspect of our efforts to uplift the quality of life of all our people , especially of the previously disadvantaged sector .
i told myself that this was the last time that i would ever stand up in this house and talk about the people in the residential units .
when those amendments are referred here , which i expect to be the case , we must deal with them as soon as possible and in the best possible way .
it can be reduced to approximately one month if the minister of land affairs would delegate the authority to issue these certificates to provincial governments .
since this is an emergency measure , i assume that we shall also grant extra protection in certain respects to the police and traffic officials in those areas .
the reason it took three days to arrest the man was the fact that no one was available to carry out the arrest .
government do not just assist in building houses and distributing soup ; it also means keeping democracy alive .
taking up the challenge means that i have to give the assurance that the cabinet of the province and i understand what i have to do .
several international and local companies are interested , but a lot of water will have to pass under the bridge before we get to that .
are we saying that we are perpetrating a fraud against our shareholders , deceiving them into believing that we will honour this agreement ?
if they want to set up a mall or the equivalent of a mall in a black area , the banks tell them it is oversubscribed .
if any of these pillars are threatened then surely the government of the day has failed in its duty to procure the welfare of the state .
the defendant is the state , and we who are gathered in this house today , and everyone who has made a contribution to make democracy a reality .
they said that he had developed the figure of a myth while in jail and now he had to prove what he was really made of .
all we ask is that the good farmers of the western cape should stand up and declare themselves declared to remove the rotten apples from the basket .
i want to repeat for the benefit of the house the correct order of events with regard to letters that came from the national government to the province .
the department has highlighted many interesting issues over the last week and in my speech i wish to highlight some areas which need improvement and assistance .
it was the opinion of the state attorney that , under the circumstances of these thefts , the officials involved did not forfeit the state 's cover .
this is the reason for providing security and an environment in which business can generate growth and jobs must underpin our programme of action .
this is partly due , firstly , to the lack of qualified teachers , and , secondly , to a lack of popular appeal .
particularly when criticism is levelled , we take it very seriously and we see whether we are able to improve those things on the basis of what has been said .
we certainly do not buy into the notion that we cannot exercise a prerogative to govern and that everybody must agree before we do anything at all .
we hope that this year we will come closer to achieving the objectives of greater equity in education through the application of the norms and standards .
even if we work as hard as we can and move as fast as we can , we cannot do this job quickly enough .
health care of good quality cannot be provided if people encounter a health service where they are not dealt with in a way that bespeaks sensitivity , dignity and respect .
it was stated earlier in the debate that the intention of spending this money was to avoid taking teachers out of classrooms .
this banner is displayed against the background of a premier who on one occasion was himself responsible for our safety in the western cape for a period of two years .
there has been a convention in this house over the last six years that , despite that provision , notices of motion are heard as soon as the sitting begins .
from there we take them on to apply for their business and then we stay with them for two or three years to assist them .
the commission of inquiry should not simply investigate attacks on farmers but should also investigate attacks on farm workers , family violence on farms and all relevant aspects .
one of the things he mentions on the tapes is that he has a very clever dog that barks only at black people , not at white people .
perhaps the question today is whether we have gathered together in this chamber enough will , political and otherwise , to address and tackle the problem .
he says that we have nothing to be ashamed of when it comes to achievements , but that is being a bit too modest .
our families and churches need to educate the new generation about what is right and what is wrong , and to inculcate moral and ethical codes .
men who for years escaped or refused to pay maintenance will be tracked down and held responsible for the care of their children .
i was there to deal with matters relating to my two portfolios , but i have been in on a number of occasions and also watched it on my television set .
the provincial government commits itself to leading the clean-up of the province , but success depends on the enthusiastic participation of others .
it is important from an economic point of view to raise the profile of the region so as to enhance the capital inflow into the province 's economy .
the first is a new issue to me and most people but , from its severity , evidently not a new challenge .
the argument forwarded here is that it is necessary to turn the education system upside down in order to effect some change .
this was an important point and one that i put on the table , but i believe that some of our colleagues agreed with it .
the project has entailed detailed investigation of the requirements of both farm owners and farm workers as to their specific preferences regarding settlement , either on or off farms .
we are now faced with the problem of not being able to change the prejudiced mindset of people to a culture of sharing .
those people were still fortunate to get buyers , because in the same area another five to six farms are in the market , but there are no buyers .
the experience of blacks has been that although they can do the job themselves , when they take a white partner , the white partner will get the access to finance .
if a minister cannot account for the money , how can he possibly approve the authorisation of the expenditure of that money ?
after a very detailed piece of research , interviewing a large number of people in the province , they reach this conclusion , and i quote :
i will continue to hear him , but i must warn him now that he cannot , at this moment , use a point of order to put a counter-argument .
we in this province have been granted the freedom , opportunity and the responsibility to shape our society and to lay the foundation on which a future must be built .
we will make a point of ensuring that the moneys spent in this province are spent correctly , for the purpose for which they were intended .
lest i seem to be painting only a picture of gloom in respect of own revenue , let me say immediately that prospects for improving this situation are hopeful :
even if that idea came along , how can we guarantee that central government will not take it for themselves and deal with it in that fashion ?
i mean , what would happen if a government were elected and appointed and it could not pass its own budgets to drive its own programmes ?
i will do so if information is placed before me and i believe that that information is sufficiently relevant in order to take the matter a stage further .
they can then come and say , for example , there is a town clerk or an administrative person in a certain municipality and that person can be utilised in a different municipality .
very importantly , any change in activity has to be assessed as to its impact on the quality of life of surrounding people affected by such activity .
they establish their company in a particular country for the duration of the tenure and when they are finished they pull it all up and they locate to another one .
we hope that for the next financial year it will be far better , particularly when we look at the economic industry that agriculture is developing into .
the overall objective of the national framework includes one equal agricultural sector which is not reflected in the objective , as it is in the national legislation .
without having the accurate information before me now , i would assume that if officials were working overtime , that is the budget from which it would have been taken initially .
were taken out of the classroom when they had duties to perform in the classroom , i will condemn it and i will not allow it again .
it will be necessary to also continue with the forging of alliances with the international agencies and learn from the experiences and exchange ideas .
if we cannot resolve the issue , i will suspend business of the house for five minutes so that we can come back with a solution to the problem .
regarding conflict of interest , developed over decades , is that the individual concerned is required to declare that interest when the matter is raised .
i trust that the standing committee on finance , who will be sitting tonight , will also afford themselves the opportunity to watch some of the game .
many people probably believe that there was no cooperation on our part with the demarcation board , and that there was also not much love lost between us .
it is a fact that the departments are not aware of the interdepartmental strategy and we would like to see some form of better communication there .
i am sure many members , even those few who are guilty of unauthorised absence , do not even know that we have such a provision in the act .
as i said , i have nothing to do with the establishment or the day-to-day running of that operation or any of the companies involved therewith .
] mr m louis : a third benefit would be the fostering of international sport relations and the fourth benefit might even be to get international private clubs to purchase local clubs for trainers .
we will therefore provide incentives for good performance , disincentives for poor performance , and training to improve performance , but we will expect to see the results .
we will support those principals and we will not require them to get consensus from the last dissenting person before they exercise their leadership .
during the past few weeks there has been much discussion of language and the role it plays in schools , courts and hospitals , where successful communication is of the utmost importance .
if we consider and appreciate that the implications of proper legislation in regard to public transport rest with us entirely , we must see to it that this legislation is correctly implemented .
at the time that he had to apply his mind to this question , did he know that he would be reimbursed or has he now been given the information that he will be reimbursed ?
needless to say , the western cape was the only province where school days were not lost in order to train educators to manage the elections .
as indicated in the bill , the appropriation had to go through the standing committee in order for them to consider it and make their report and we had to confine ourselves to that .
i want to ask the question : who gave that instruction from the police in pretoria that the provincial commissioner and his officers here should go softly on law enforcement ?
we need to make sure that the judgments are such that the ordinary person has faith and confidence in the system based on the outcome of the cases that they deal with .
in fact , another shopping centre was built to the first floor when they realised that they did not have a plan to build from .
today i want to predict that the rest of the country will in future refer to us in the western cape as an example of how poverty can be successfully combated .
what i said with regard to the matter was that every time smoke appears in a bush i do not always attribute it to natural causes .
or rather , considering from which quarter this specific question emanates , was it not perhaps a case of intimidation of the community not to attend the meeting ?
there is an ongoing bleating from that side of the house claiming only they know what is going on and only they can represent the poor and only they can deliver .
we have suffered several disasters over the past five years and every time we have to stand there cap in hand , waiting for the president to declare a disaster .
i would like to conclude by thanking the department and all the members of the standing committee on economic development for their contribution and the role they will be playing this year .
we have seen commuters being shot at , injured , and intimidated , and we have seen schoolchildren being endangered on their way to school .
that is acceptable to me , but political interference in the judiciary is , i think , something all of us in all political parties must reject with the contempt it deserves .
i believe our people are mature enough to understand that it is never easy to catch the terrorists , but they need to know that we are trying to catch them .
two months before an election it would even be tempting to capture this sentiment and turn it into votes , but it would remain a fundamentally untrue sentiment .
when the public finance management act is passed , ministers will have to understand that they are going to have a far greater role in accounting for their moneys .
i am of the opinion that not enough is being done with regard to job creation , but we know for a fact that our country is walking under the curse of unemployment .
i vividly remember writing letters to some of my colleagues last year , diplomatically pointing out that they were over budget and should do something about it .
on behalf of the government of the western cape and all its citizens i give the people of mozambique the assurance that our thoughts and prayers are with them in their time of need .
i want to know why so much time elapsed , why so much water was allowed to flow under the bridge before something was really done to bring peace to the people affected .
we would like to know when his consultant was appointed and when we will be able to see the results of the consultant 's work , because the excuses cannot be sustained for long .
when one looks at certain schools that had the short end of the stick in the previous term , one gets the idea that those schools have deteriorated steadily .
while i have an understanding of the difficult circumstances in which they work , we cannot close our eyes to cases where they should have treated people differently and this did not happen .
we can build one road in an area , but then we cannot soon build other roads there , because we have to build them in other parts of the province as well .
i think that funding is the only problem at this stage because such enormous pressure is being exerted on social services in the province and this in turn weakens the economic sector .
when farms are no longer productive and profitable , and when as a result of this farms change owners , it is often the farm workers and their children who come off worst .
the pharmaceutical companies are occasionally accused of placing too much emphasis on the entrenchment of their intellectual property rights and not taking enough note of the needs of the sick .
if we want to take the public with us on this we need to be able to demonstrate that the forces of the law are effective in taking criminals off the street .
if he has no sense of humour and cannot appreciate a little humour amongst the seriousness then , i am afraid to say , i feel very sorry for him .
i must say that when i came in here it always seemed like a major mystery to me , and i would like to find the gentleman or lady who initiated it .
purely from a practical viewpoint , it is an impossible task for one person , or even two or three people , to be fully informed about every piece of legislation before the house .
i think he will find that the amount we have allocated to him will at least enable him to create a good post for someone to help him with secretarial services .
we even called in representatives of the national department of welfare and population development and asked them what they had in place to combat those social ills when the problem arose .
we know that the department gives amounts to organisations in the community to promote sport , but we also know that many of those organisations do not provide the department with financial statements .
the fact of the matter is that it is estimated that one in six municipalities is currently bankrupt and only one in five municipalities is able to raise credit at commercial banks .
i realise that had i gained the opportunity earlier to get into agriculture , i would have been far more successful as a farmer than i am today .
they have not , and there is no hope that they ever will if the leaders in this province do not put people first and satisfy the needs of the people .
after all , it is specifically the western cape which , some time ago , took the initiative of establishing a code of conduct for farm workers and their employers with a view to defusing emotions .
it is a pity that i have to say this to them , because i am certain that it has been said umpteen times within their own ranks that they simply shot themselves in the foot .
the result was that the white afrikaner began to fight with the black people working at that hotel , and there was great drama outside the hotel , in front of the tourists whom he had been transporting .
sir , on behalf of the standing committee on finance , development planning and gambling , i want to express our thanks and sincere appreciation for all the submissions and replies , excluding one , tendered in a dignified manner .
what i am referring to is the function of parliament as an institution that must give effect to the political will of the people of this province as expressed through the ballot-box .
the committee expresses its appreciation for the submissions provided by provincial departments and wishes to commend them for the quality of the information provided to questions put by members .
tragically enough , when many of those people find themselves in the city or on the fringes of the city , they are often worse off than they would have been where they came from .
i have said that we in this province , as in the rest of the country , are embarking on the most fundamental transformation of local government , whilst the majority of municipalities are experiencing financial and administrative problems .
one of my main objectives is to ensure that we get a public transport system in the city centre so that it will no longer be necessary to bring cars into the city centre .
it is very important to accept that if we want to set this province or any other province in the country to rights , the churches and the teachers will have to play a far more positive role .
i believe that once the cabinet has taken the decision , the opportunity should perhaps have been created to inform all the parties or members of the house about what they supposedly did .
in this way we can preserve job opportunities and contribute so that that those who sit for weeks on a verandah and perhaps work for only two to three weeks in the rural areas , are also able to keep their jobs .
we have had sympathy within the standing committee for the department of health and social services that has to find funds to increase the facilities and funds for children , elderly persons and families .
furthermore , if i remember correctly , there was also an insolvency in regard to one of the buildings , there was a delay in completing it and there was litigation pending in that regard .
a further statement which she made , that black businesses are leaving the province , is totally and utterly incorrect and i challenge her to prove it , because it is simply not true .
failure is on the cards if we are not successful in releasing our people from the devastating effects of poverty , which is growing to the point of despair .
if they are only geared to about the television cameras , and they attack me and the police , they are only confusing the community because the community at large knows that i do a great deal of work in the community .
i think we have to realise that when we make laws in this country and are unable to implement those laws , then we should rather not make laws at all , but abolish them and get along without them .
this will also improve with the envisaged legislation that is on the agenda of the department of agriculture so that the province and agriculture can be in the forefront of technology and so that we can remain competitive .
what type of skewed morality is this that the very people who are against the death penalty are not against sending our youngsters into foreign lands to murder people there ?
the house should also be informed that in my capacity as provincial minister responsible for financial matters , i have the power vested in me to give guidance in , and exercise control over state moneys .
i do not say that we do not need those buildings , but i would swear that we can spend less money on leasing buildings to carry out our functions .
i have stated my view that , as long as the national parliament is near us , this saves us a tremendous amount of money and time and that we will have to think this matter over very carefully .
as far as we are concerned , we will keep pushing because this province is very proud that they have just won the award for the province that has done the most about unemployment .
we provided the department of finance with a booklet which was politically dismissed by the former minister of finance , but to our surprise elements of the document were included in the budget the following year .
on the other hand , logic also tells me that a child who is in a school that is well-equipped and has facilities , has a better chance of being included in a school team .
a poorer public image leads to a decline in interest and to a decline in pride , a drop in staff morale and inevitably it leads to a decline in standards .
while driving to work during the course of last year , one only saw one or two of the special number-plates every week , but now one sees a number of them every day .
some people would like to see action , but they do not appreciate that the action could have a ripple effect , to such an extent that this could cause bigger problems for us .
i spoke to the national minister of transport , who said that he would support any action that i took , but we should try to get a solution other than a violent solution .
we now appeal to them , as our people who stood with us through bloody circumstances , through thick and thin , to bring about change in the country , to take a sober decision .
i would like to know whether we are going to find a similar assessment made in any white area in this country and whether we have white areas that are called poor or are surrounded by squatter camps .
it is just an excuse to say that the national government has not yet finished developing a policy , and that we as a province therefore cannot do anything to develop our own policy .
we shall find out where facilities are that are complimentary to each other , especially in rural areas , and we shall help those municipalities to put them into a saleable package that we shall help them market overseas .
i am quite sure that many schools in many communities that used to have the best would consent to our trying for a closed period of three to four years to channel the money to other schools in a purposeful way .
i certainly do not think that it is a solution , but i am appalled at the lack of responsibility that so many learners display , partly because it has become an easy excuse to blame the past .
however , there must be an additional point , that the purchaser enters into an agreement with the municipality whereby in the case where there are still arrears , the debt is acknowledged and they undertake to pay that debt .
if he at this stage does not have that kind of detailed information , why has he not made an effort to find out the detail about this expenditure that we have been asked to consider ?
if a government cannot ensure a safe society for the citizens of its country then a situation develops which could give rise to people doing everything that they can to make provision to protect themselves .
it is clear to me that here in the province of the western cape these are statements in the house , but if one looks at the matter very carefully , one can see that we are not making an effort about racism out there .
this will not only ensure that the end product is bigger and gives the residents more privacy , but also get the owner and his family used to putting money aside each month for their house .
the council has a particularly important role to play in engaging civil society in the process of developing and finalising the provincial strategic plan , an initiative to which i shall return shortly .
i am worried that what is going to happen if we do not plan for it is that that act is going to end up in the constitutional court , a long process is going to take place and a number of developments and other processes are going to be affected by that .
he told me that he would speak to the national minister of defence again so that we could get enough people on the ground to ensure for once and for all that we maintain law and order .
the subordination of the employee to the employer is not a subordination based on superiority of the employer but on respect and mutual good attitudes and the acceptance of the employer as the leader in the sphere of agriculture .
thereafter , one goes together with the members of that household to the grave concerned and lays a wreath , and does not just take along the press and go there with the aim of making political gain .
when one goes through the activities of the departments , and when one looks at the budget , it is quite clear that the province has considerable resources in the provincial administration as well as in the province generally .
we as a country will continue giving it undue weight , and draw some questionable conclusions from the results , until we have proper benchmarking across a range of variables at various levels of our education system .
i firmly believe that one cannot be a believer when one has something to eat and one does not have a worry or a concern of a poor brother or sister or mother who is hungry outside .
madam , if we do not improve the living conditions of our people , and if we do not see to it that they become the proud owners of homes , then we are no better than the apartheid government that denied our people that right .
these vulnerable people , together with the disabled , those who seek their next meal from pillar to post , the homeless and others , are the reason we are here , the reason we exist in this house .
one cannot bring that about by telling those who suffered under racism that they must never speak about it again , and that when they do speak about it they will be cut down to size .
we on this side of the house seek peace and economic progress because when things go badly with the employer , the employee also suffers ; this then leads to unemployment , poverty and misery .
i think we would all agree that although it is the most important building block , it is also a tremendously complex aspect which i think more people speak about and that people outside this area often do not understand .
the defence argues that such a young child , scarcely seven years old , cannot be guilty of all these terrible deeds ; the poor child , democracy , is surely far too young to accept responsibility for such charges .
speaking of international days , i want to appeal to the people of the province of the western cape to come out en masse and make a stand against ongoing violence , especially violence against children , women and our senior citizens .
as a result of circumstances in the early years of the previous parliament , for which no one here today can be held responsible , a myth developed that the standing committee on finance should be elevated in importance above other standing committees .
looking at the documents setting out the strategic objectives and the outcomes in terms of the provincial parliament , one sees that the provincial parliament has not , up to now , done enough about those particular responsibilities .
towards the end of last year we fought hard and successfully to ensure that they were allowed to continue their good work , and we are honoured by their participation in this morning 's ceremony .
those people who have taken part in this debate have refused to condemn the lack of support for the police from the central government , who is the sole and only responsible authority to provide for the police in this country .
just today , in die burger , we read that more and more students are going to private educational facilities instead of public educational facilities , and the reason is that they truly believe that public schools are not giving the standard that is desired .
i must say , for my part , having dealt with them over the past few years , for as long as i have been here , that they are very fine public servants who have provided us as legislators with a huge amount of background information .
i had in fact expected far more , specifically because i think that the reason for this discussion is of such a nature that our children 's future is at stake and we have to proceed with this kind of exercise with the right sense of responsibility .
may they enjoy the few years they have to do so , because we have three years in which to go into those areas and work with the people whom they keep on frightening about the elections .
